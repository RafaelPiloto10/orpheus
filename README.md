# Project Orpheus

In today's world, music is a universal language that transcends borders and connects people from all walks of life.
However, the messages conveyed through music often reflect societal norms and values that shape our culture.
In this project, we propose to use a Kaggle dataset of a million songs and potentially leverage the Spotify API to retrieve song metadata to analyze how songs conform to societal standards and issues such as gender and sociopolitical factors.
