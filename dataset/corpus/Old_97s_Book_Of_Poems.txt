Rowboat lightning I kissed her yeah it didn't mean a thing  
Seems like years ago it was yesterday  
Fire drill yell freeze don't hang around long face disease  
I got a book of poems that's gonna set you free  
Well it's bad luck and it's a hard luck story  
And I'm sorry I ain't sticking around  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems ain't enough  
Well it's a sick world and sixteen days  
I got nightmares every night  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems ain't enough  
Hardcore uptown not the kind of place you wanna settle down  
I only walked her home but that was bad enough  
Two trains yell freeze it was a head-on cold now it's a love disease  
I got a book of poems you gotta see to believe
