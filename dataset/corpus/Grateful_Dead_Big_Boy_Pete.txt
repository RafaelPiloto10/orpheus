The joint was jumping on the corner down on Honky Tonk Street,  
All of a sudden up pulled a Cadillac and out stepped a can named Pete.  
A diamond on every finger, he wore he wore a tailor made suit,  
Black cigar, he wore a Stetson hat,  
He wore a pair on cowboy boots,  
Busted on through the door mad as he could be,  
Don't mess around, I'll cut you down 'cause my name is Big Boy Pete.  
The music stopped, there wasn't a sound,  
Up in the corner stood Bad Man Brown.  
He smiled and grinned, he said you know my friend,  
Take two steps further I'm going kick you in the hide,  
Forty-Five keep it alive, seven bullets on my side.  
Brown pulled a knife, jumped on Pete,  
Fought from the counter right on out to the street.  
They swung from the north, swung from the south,  
Pete got the blackjack out.  
Brown went out his mind, yes he did, now we deeply see,  
If you're ever down on the corner, down on Honky Tonk Street,  
Don't mess around he'll cut you down,  
Take a lesson from Big Boy Pete
