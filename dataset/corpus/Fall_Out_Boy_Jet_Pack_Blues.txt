[Verse 1]  
I got those jet pack blues just like Judy,  
The kind that makes June feel like September,  
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember.  
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind  
Behind these two-way highway lines,  
When the city goes silent,  
The ringing in my ears gets violent.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got those jet pack blues,  
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me,  
Honey, don't you leave.  
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink?  
It never mattered what it was, I think.  
Our hands were just that close,  
The sweetness never lasted, no.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".  
  
[Bridge]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Outro]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".
