One electrified eye  
Freezing metalized smile  
No more cheating the code  
The scene is set - emotions disconnected  
  
Welcome to the cyber trail  
Laser cops and sirens wail  
Held down with magnetic force  
Said: come with us - you broke the law  
  
Obey the rules - don't do no wrong  
A thought too loud - and crime is done  
No appeal for the common man  
Just cold hard facts - in computer land  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
Cyborg arms put the straps around  
One more second 'till the switch comes down  
Flaching lights - a cage of steel  
Turns my head into a dead dogs meal  
  
In this world - robotic rage  
You'll understand the acid pain  
Do no right - you won't last long  
Remote controlled - under the heel of submission  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No remorse - for human kind  
No recourse - to keep your mind  
It's too late - there's no escape  
Is this the end of the line  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No use for humanity  
We'll never ever be free again  
No tomorrows  
Zero - the number of the year  
Zero - the number of the year
