She look what?  
She look good, she bad as a motherfucka  
She look good?  
Yeah  
I mean hows her heart? Hows her head? Her mind right?  
Her brain right-shit  
L-look, listen nigga  
Yeah  
Tell your girl if she got a bad motherfucka that look like her, act like her  
Shit nigga you already know what to do  
  
Tell your girl to hook it up  
Tell your girl to hook it up  
  
[Chorus:]  
[R. Kelly]  
If she got a friend homie, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she got a cousin homie, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she got a sister homie, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up  
  
[R. Kelly]  
If she sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up  
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up  
  
Homie you spite, and your girl-she a dime piece  
Nigga now I know why you ain't be hangin' 'round me  
The way she look I'd do the same, spend that time, play that game  
Id like to say if I like that up, if I was you id knock that up  
Open the door for her man, pull out her chair  
She may not know it but there's wifee right there  
Worth spending that money, lookin' fresh as a freezer  
Sexy, good girl, pretty and as sweet as can be  
You could take her straight home to mama, even to meet your pops  
She don't come with no drama, damn you luck bastard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
If she sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up  
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up (Kellz I got
yeah homie)  
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up  
  
[Huey]  
Its your boy Huey  
  
Kellz I see you pimpin' in the club with the baddest chick  
If she got a partner, tell her she should get with this  
A well known money makin' H-U-E-Y  
  
Huey be the man to give some real love, you know that playa be I  
The type that would take her out the hood  
Make sure her hair and her nails look good  
500 benz you can break a lil' wood  
If she was my girl, I'm a do what I could  
As long as you understand its 50-50  
You do for me, I do for you  
You shoot for me and I'd shoot for you  
You be sweet to me and I'm sweet to you  
You may think I'm lyin' but it's the truth  
Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it  
Its easy for me to be pimpin'  
But I'm a gonna make you my mistress  
To avoid the life, lookin' rough  
Head and attitude, all messed up  
All ya gotta do is holler at Kellz  
And tell him done hook it up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If she sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up  
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up  
  
[R. Kelly]  
If she like real playas and don't fuck with no haters  
Wanna get with a real balla that's makin' that real paper  
If she want a good life shop, hop out fancy cars  
Award shows, party mingle with all the stars  
Now if she understand that I am her blaming man  
And when comes to sellin' out shes my sold out crowd  
And if shes not the type that got a lot foreplay  
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If she sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up  
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up  
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up  
  
Huey  
Kellz my nigga  
Yeah  
We in the club see that exercise girl  
We in the club see that exercise girl  
Walk it out  
Yeah  
This might be the remix
