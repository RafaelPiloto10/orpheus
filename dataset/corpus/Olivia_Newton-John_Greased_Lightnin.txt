Why this car is automatic  
It's systematic  
It's hydromatic  
Why it's greased lightnin'!  
(grease lightnin'!)  
  
We'll get some overhead lifters, and four-barrel quads, oh yeah  
(Keep talkin', oh keep talkin')  
Fuel injection cut off, and chrome plated rods, oh yeah  
(I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money)  
With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door  
You know that ain't no shit  
We'll be gettin' lots of tit in grease lightnin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Go, grease lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile  
(Grease lightnin', go grease lightnin')  
Go, grease lightnin', you're coastin' through the heat lap trials  
(Grease lightnin', go grease lightnin')  
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for grease lightnin'  
  
We'll get some purple French tail lights and thirty-inch fins, oh yeah  
A palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins, oh yeah  
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks, I can get off my rocks  
You know that I ain't braggin',  
She's a real pussy wagon - grease lightnin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
