I cut my finger when you left the room  
The wound has healed long since then  
But the finger keeps bleeding, keeps bleeding  
For reasons unknown to me  
  
I heard me stutter when you left the room  
The wound has healed long since then  
But my mind keeps stuttering, keeps stuttering  
For reasons unknown to me  
  
If only I could remember  
The tune I was whistling that day  
If only I could remember  
The streets I had walked that day  
  
If only I could remember  
If only, if only  
  
I saw me crying when you left the room  
The wound has healed long since then  
But my soul keeps crying, keeps crying  
For reasons unknown to me  
  
If only you could tell me  
Why I'm smoking myself to death?  
If only you could tell me  
Why I'm working myself to death?  
  
If only you could tell me  
If only, if only
