So little to say but so much time,  
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind.  
Please wear the face, the one where you smile,  
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry.  
  
Forgive me first love, but I'm tired.  
I need to get away to feel again.  
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind.  
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself  
Simply, it's tiring.  
  
This love has dried up and stayed behind,  
And if I stay I'll be alive,  
Then choke on words I'd always hide.  
Excuse me first love, but we're through.  
I need to taste the kiss from someone new.  
  
Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.  
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.  
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love,  
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
