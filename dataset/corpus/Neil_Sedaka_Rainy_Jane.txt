With a cloud above her head  
Here comes rainy Jane.  
If she stops you, man, she'll bore you  
With that sad refrain.  
It's the same old story.  
We've heard a thousand times before.  
She'll tell you how he broke her heart  
And then the tears will start to pour.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.  
  
Jane, you're just a shadow of  
The girl you used to be.  
Once you used to live for life  
And now you live for sympathy.  
True, your heart's been broken  
And you got the right to cry,  
But if you're gonna keep it up  
The sunshine's gonna pass you by.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.  
  
You can change the weather,  
No one loves a rainy day.  
Come let's get together,  
Clouds will clear up when you cheer up,  
Take each raindrop, make the rain stop.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.
