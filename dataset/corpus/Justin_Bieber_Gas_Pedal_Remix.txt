Neighborhoods hella jealous when they see the whips  
Pull up in the gun metal Rari with a fresh fit  
Gas pedal, gas pedal

Pedal to the floor, watch me peel out

I'm the bomb you can't disarm me  
I need multiple cuts like a swiss army  
And I hope that she ain't looking for no prince charming  
Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning  
Tell the driver gas pedal, yo Suzy I got cash to blow  
Follow the leader, in high school I was an under-achiever  
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir  
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature  
Eat your heart out you should take the [?] out  
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out  
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out  
When you walk in the building the bitches run out  
It should be already platinum before it come out  
We should do it major look in the eyes of my haters they say
