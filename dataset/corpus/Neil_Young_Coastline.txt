Down on the coastline, Highway One  
People headin' out for the sun  
That's where I found you, long time ago.  
  
You're my angel, you're my queen  
You're my best friends in between  
We don't back down from no trouble  
We do get up in the mornin'.  
  
Oooweee, baby, what a night  
That old moon sure is shinin' bright  
We'll be dancin' 'til the mornin' comes.  
  
High on the mountain top above the clouds  
No wonder we get a little loud  
We don't back down from no trouble  
We do get up in the mornin'.
