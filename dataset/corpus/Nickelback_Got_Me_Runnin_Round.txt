[Verse 1]  
Wake up  
My baby still looks amazing with no make-up  
Damn it I knew the second that you came up  
From underneath the covers  
Said "I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother"  
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me  
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country  
And now we're buying diamonds  
Saying it's only 20 karats it can't be that hard to find it, baby  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Your touch has made me a believer  
Your love is all I ever needed  
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity  
  
[Chrous] x2  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
She takes like the sunshine kissing me  
Even sweeter than honey on a bumblebee  
She said honey if you want to you can come with me  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
  
[Verse 2]  
Light on sunset  
Can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet  
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet  
As soon as I looked over  
Yeah the waiter sugarcoated  
You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde girl  
What you doing nothing wrong girl  
Looks like we got another come along girl  
If you ain't afraid to try it  
You know we'll be flying private long as I can be the pilot baby  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Your touch has made me a believer  
Your love is all I ever needed  
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity  
  
[Chrous] x2  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
She takes like the sunshine kissing me  
Even sweeter than honey on a bumblebee  
She said honey if you want to you can come with me  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh  
  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
(Runnin' and Runnin' and Runnin' and x5)  
  
[Verse 3: Flo Rida]  
Flo Rida girl, you got me runnin' round  
What a perfect misses, momma she still eat McDonald's  
Taste delicious scream Madonna knock this swiss so I guess she did it  
What, my kisses?  
What, my pictures?  
Hoping she pops back pays a visit  
To my baby yeah, my baby girl  
Run around town on a treadmill  
I ain't going nowhere, no wonder where  
That's what she wear  
Gotta playmate when I join the party  
She was supposed to be in a queue here  
Birthday cake, wanna grant my wishes  
Every day I'm losing my breath  
Can't replace that face, that waist  
I'd chase this girl to Belvidere  
Baby  
  
[Chrous] x2  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
She takes like the sunshine kissing me  
Even sweeter than honey on a bumblebee  
She said honey if you want to you can come with me  
She's got me runnin' round and round  
  
[Bridge] x2  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh  
Oh, oh o-o-o-o-oh oh
