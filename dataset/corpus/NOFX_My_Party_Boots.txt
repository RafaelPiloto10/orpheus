Life is fast but I don't wanna live past you, cuz you are my only roots  
  
I was the king of the drug booze thing now I've worn out the soles of my party
boots.  
  
So call me shit-faced master of disgrace, I don't care cuz my outer skin  
  
Is think like crust, and a liver that's rusted out now I'm on a list (for a
better one)  
  
Everybody wants to give a shit outta me, I won't give it but i'll give
ambivalence.  
  
I gotta memory box cuz my memory blocks me, from remembering weeks  
  
All the blacked out nights into white out mornings, into grey matter
damagings.  
  
So call me fat fuck geriatric punk rock. Give it straight cuz I deserve  
  
A verbal beating from an audience bleating (not bleeding), and a melee with no
concern.  
  
Everybody wants to give a shit outta me, I wont give it but i'll give
irresponsiveness  
  
Everybody wants to drag me up again, I wanna go but the price keeps goin up  
  
Goin down is simple and practical, laying low but keeping it cynical  
  
I'm on the wagon and it's such a drag, without a key kick, shot and a drag.  
  
[Hefe's good old fashioned solo]  
  
Evidently no one likes a quitter or an old punk's bitterness  
  
So I'm waitin for the tap, on my shoulder cuz we're all getting older not
better  
  
And the laughs are no longer with us (they're at us)  
  
So call me fat fuck, geriatric punk  
  
Call me fat fuck, geriatric punk  
  
Call me fat fuck, geriatric punk, shit face master of disgrace.
