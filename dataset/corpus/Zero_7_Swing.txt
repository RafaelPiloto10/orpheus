Thought you'd be forever the same  
When did you become so easy to change?  
Can't like who I want  
No, that's not true  
  
I do know  
Just can't figure out how to pin down  
There will be no unguarded kisses,  
Let go of my hand when they're around  
  
They say I'm unsound  
But what do they know?  
They can't figure out how to get down  
  
Soon enough I won't care  
Stay in my arms, if you dare  
You can't romanticize  
They are crazy  
  
Will only let you down  
Try to figure out, how to keep you down  
They're all alone  
I will keep you down
