Oh I used to love you  
But now that's hard to do  
'cause I got some information  
'bout the evil things at night that you do  
Now the whole thing is through (we're through)  
Oh you're such a devil  
How'd you get me to believe you were true  
  
Oh my momma warned me  
And how my daddy cried  
The day I left my home  
You said you'd always keep me satisfied  
But oh how you lied (you lied)  
Well I should have heard my momma's words  
But then I guess I had to much pride (original sin)  
  
First chorus  
I used to lie awake at night  
And see your face on the ceilin'  
What a bad a feelin' I have  
When I think of how you almost got me  
In the ways of the world  
In the ways of the world  
  
My so-called friends said I misjudged you  
My anger's all in vain  
But I'm afraid you got to them  
Before I had a chance to explain  
And it caused me such pain (ouch!)  
'cause they were such good friends of mine  
But now you've got them playin' you game (you creep)  
  
First chorus  
  
Well I believe in jesus  
And what he said he's gonna do  
He'll put an apple in your lyin mouth  
And cook you in a sulfer stew  
One that'll never be through  
(is it soup yet? no)  
Ah, but if he hadn't rescued me  
Then I'd be down there cookin' too  
Oh if jesus hadn't rescued me  
Then I'd be cookin' right next to you  
  
Second chorus  
I used to lie awake at night  
And see your face on the ceilin'  
What a great feelin' I have  
When I think of how you're gonna get yours  
At the end of the world  
At the end of the world  
Oh at the end of the world
