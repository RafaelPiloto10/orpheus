Everybody's gone away  
Said they're movin' to L.A.  
There's not a soul I know around  
Everybody's leavin' town.  
  
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane  
Find the sunshine leave the rain  
They said this town will waste their time  
I guess they're right, it's wasted mine.  
  
Some gotta win, some gotta lose  
Good time Charlie's got the blues.  
Good time Charlie's got the blues.  
  
You know my heart keeps tellin' me  
You're not a kid at forty-three  
You play around you lose your wife  
You play too long you lose your life.  
  
I'm hopin' time will ease the pain  
Can't find a thing to ease the rain  
I'd love to try and setlle down  
But everybody's leavin' town.  
  
Some gotta win, some gotta lose  
Good time Charlie's got the blues.  
Good time Charlie's got the blues.
