Woke up this morning wanting to cry  
Then I remember, yes, I know why  
She's a real good one for having her cake  
I'm gonna go fishing or jump in the lake  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna go fishing, that's what I'll do  
Think about nothing, not even you  
Catch a real big one, a big speckled trout  
Snapping in the water, I'll pull him on out  
  
Sweet talking liar, spin me a yarn  
Tell me a story, big as a barn  
Don't stop listening, I won't hear you out  
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
If a gal is a liar, a gal is a fool  
Playing for keepers and breaking the rules  
She'll be the loser, yet to find out  
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
Here in the water, look at him shine  
There goes a big one, that one is mine  
Catch up the reel now, I've got the feel now  
Hooked onto my fly rod, I've got me a trout  
  
Sweet talking liar, you're in for a fall  
You tell me a story, you cut to the wall  
Don't go my way, I'm down the highway  
I'm gonna go fishing  
  
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing  
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing and get me some trout
