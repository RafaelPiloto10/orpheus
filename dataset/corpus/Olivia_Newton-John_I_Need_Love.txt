It's nothing personal  
In other circumstances  
Another place, another time  
I would take my chances  
  
Oh! I know I could take you home tonight  
But I don't want to wake up with you wishing I was alone  
Don't rush 'cause when the timing's right I'll know I wanna be sure  
I just can't play the game anymore  
  
I'm not lookin for a bandaid on loneliness  
I'm not lookin for a temporary get me through the night  
I'm holding out for something more than physical  
I need love to make the sex right  
  
It's nothing personal  
In other circumstances  
Another place, another time  
And I might take my chances  
  
I want you, and I'm not hiding from the way I feel  
I've been trying to fill this empty heart  
With something not real  
And I don't want to live like that anymore  
In a world goin' crazy  
These days you've really got to be sure  
  
So I'm not lookin for a bandaid on loneliness  
I'm not lookin for a temporary get me through the night  
I'm holding out for something more than physical  
I need love to make the sex feel right  
Love can make it feel good  
Love can make it better  
It's nothing personal  
In other circumstances  
Another place, another time  
No I'm not lookin' for a bandaid on loneliness  
I'm not lookin' for a temporary get me through the night  
I'm holdin' out for something more than physical  
I need love to make the sex feel right
