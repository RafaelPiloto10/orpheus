Oh, the lights of magdala flicker  
Dimly on the shore  
Holy sailor sailing on the sea  
Patiently waiting she walked quietly  
To the door  
Another lonely night in galilee  
Chorus:  
Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow  
Save them for tomorrow if it comes  
When we'll meet within the circle  
Round the sun  
Oh, if heaven were a lady don't you  
Know you'd been the one  
Through the streets of jerusalem  
You followed him once more  
Holy sailor's come home from the sea  
Someone somewhere's calling him  
To a golden distant shore  
Far from the lonely nights in galilee  
Chorus:  
Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow  
Save them for tomorrow if it comes  
When we'll meet within the circle  
Round the sun  
Oh, if heaven were a lady don't you  
Know you'd been the one
