[Verse:]  
You have given me everything I needed  
According to your riches  
And the plans set for my life  
They are for blessings not for curses  
So I'll render unto You  
All of the glory You are due  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
Oh, I can't hold it  
You don't know how  
Much the Lord has  
Done for me  
  
[Verse 2:] Unison  
Even when I'm faithless  
Lord You are faithful  
For in the time of distress  
You'll hide me in Your tabernacle  
If these would hold their peace  
Then the rocks would cry out for me  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
[Tag]  
He has done so much  
He has been so good  
  
He's done so much  
He's been so good  
  
Oh  
So much, so good  
So good, so much  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
[Tag]  
  
[Chorus:]
