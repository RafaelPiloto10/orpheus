Today I'm starting High School  
Where boys are turned to men  
I packed my sword and shield  
We don't use paper and pen  
Everyone's a jock here  
We don't have Spartan nerds  
The weedy kids were left to die  
As breakfast for the birds  
  
We're taught to love a fight  
We're taught not to be meek  
And if we're good they feed us  
Three square meals every week  
  
Let's go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
A Spartan kindergarten  
I'm the boss that's understood  
I smack them if they're naughty  
And I thwack them if they're good  
I'm feeling rather peckish  
I'm gonna steal some food  
Caught! I'll have to punish you  
Ungrateful Spartan brood  
  
We promise not to steal  
We're not the thieving sort  
Stealing is considered good  
What's bad is getting caught  
  
Let's get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School  
  
We have a bunch of contests  
To see who is the best  
The leanest, meanest,  
Roughest, toughest Spartan contest  
This one is my favourite game  
Lashings of good fun  
Didn't feel a thing  
I want my mum  
  
We passed our last exam  
And it's Spartan graduation  
Straight away we go to work  
No time for celebration  
Ten years active service  
In the army  
No diversion  
There's only one job for a Spartan  
Killing lot's of Persians!  
  
Wondering about love?  
It's banned until you're thirty  
High School doesn't teach romance  
It teaches fighting dirty  
  
Let's go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
Let's get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School!
