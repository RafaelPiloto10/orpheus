Somewhere there's music  
How faint the tune!  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How high the moon!  
There is no moon above when love is far away  
Too  
  
Till it comes true that you love me as I love you.  
Somewhere there's music  
It's where you are  
  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How near  
How far!  
The brightest night would shine if you would come to me soon  
  
Until you will  
How still my aching heart  
How high the moon.  
  
Somewhere there's music  
It's where you are...  
  
Somewhere there's music  
Music in the air  
Oh  
I love this heaven when you're near  
I want to hear the music  
I want to be where you are.
