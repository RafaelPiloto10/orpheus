Ayo bad  
Boy for life what change  
Bu the name we's till here and we  
Gonna get rocked up round here and raise the  
Roof I'm livin proof  
Super range out of  
Nyc you can't  
Roll wit me I'm 100 times  
Faster than you  
As you are slow now let's  
Go get tha show on the road let's blow  
This popstand  
And rock it wit  
The best of the test of the  
West the best of the rest so no leaks no half time show  
Off freaks diddy speaks.
