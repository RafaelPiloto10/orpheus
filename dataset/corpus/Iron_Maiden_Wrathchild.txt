I was born into a scene of angriness and greed, and dominance and persecution.  
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen, I was never meant to be.  
  
Now I spend my time looking all around,  
For a man that's nowhere to be found.  
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,  
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.  
  
'Cause I'm a wrathchild, well I'm a wrathchild.  
Yeah I'm a wrathchild. I'm coming to get you, oh yeah.  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Say it doesn't matter ain't nothin' gonna alter the course of my destination.  
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind, or I know I'll go crazy.  
  
But now I spend my time looking all around,  
For a man thats nowhere to be found.  
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,  
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.  
  
'Cause I'm a wrathchild, well I'm a wrathchild.  
Yeah I'm a wrathchild. I'm coming to get you, oh yeah.
