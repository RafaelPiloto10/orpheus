Steer your way past the ruins of the Altar and the Mall  
Steer your way through the fables of Creation and The Fall  
Steer your way past the Palaces that rise above the rot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
Steer your heart past the Truth that you believed in yesterday  
Such as Fundamental Goodness and the Wisdom of the Way  
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
Steer you way through the pain that is far more real than you  
That's smashed the Cosmic Model, that blinded every view  
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
They whisper still, the injured stones  
The blunted mountains weep  
As he died to make men holy  
Let us die to make things cheap  
And say the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask  
To the one who was never, never equal to the task  
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
They whisper still, the injured stones  
The blunted mountains weep  
As he died to make men holy  
Let us die to make things cheap  
And say the Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought
