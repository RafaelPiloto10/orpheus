Found a job in a great big office  
And I really love this place  
I got my, my very own Scotch tape dispenser  
And I got a private parking space, ha  
  
And I, I got a coffee mug with my name right on it  
In big bold letters so everyone knows it's mine  
Don't even touch it, 'cause, 'cause it doesn't belong to you  
I'm watching you, so don't get funny  
  
I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder  
Watch out, it's dog eat dog  
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right  
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog, here we go  
  
I love to watch my boss get angry  
So I can count the veins in his neck, ha  
Every day is like a picnic  
Every Friday, get a check  
  
Well, do I smell jelly donuts? This is my lucky day  
I'll have some coffee with a carcinogenic sweetener  
Hold on a minute, just one more jelly donut  
They'll never miss it, no, they'll never miss it  
  
I, I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder  
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog  
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right  
Watch out, hey, well, it's dog eat dog  
  
Sometimes I can't believe this is all really happening  
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm really sitting here  
Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler  
Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful chair  
  
No-duddi-o d-du-du-oh-ya, ha, ha  
  
Nobody's sure what I do here  
And, ah, that's just fine with me  
Five o'clock is here much too soon now  
'Cause I just never wanna leave  
  
I can bend paper clips into the shapes of small animals  
Maybe I could get on, on David Letterman  
I think I made a big mistake  
Where's my liquid paper, where's my liquid paper  
  
I, I'm climbing up, way up the corporate ladder now  
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog  
Nose against the grindstone, it feels all right  
Better be careful now, it's dog eat dog  
Watch me work, hey, hey, stand back now  
Look out, mama, it's dog eat dog  
Nose against the grindstone, it feels real good  
  
Hey, dog eat dog, here we go (doggy doggy dog dog, it's dog eat dog)  
I said pang-ang, dog eat dog (woof woof, hey hey, dog eat dog)  
I said, (sound), dog eat dog (here we go, ha, dog eat dog)  
La la ha he, dog eat dog, la la ha he, dog eat dog (ruff ruff, dog eat dog,
dog eat dog)
