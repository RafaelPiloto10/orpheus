We said our goodbyes long ago never thinking we'd miss each other so  
All the memories we can't leave behind oh we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another not you how foolish I thought the same too  
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds oh we must have been out of our
minds  
[ piano ]  
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known  
And reap together the wild seeds we've sown  
Surely they can forgive us and find that we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another...  
Yes we must have been out of our minds yeah
