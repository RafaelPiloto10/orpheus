When you come across  
The guy who thinks he's boss  
Yet never knows the reason why  
He won't let you pass  
Won't answer things you ask  
He's got his orders, do or die  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone said to me  
If you tip the doorman heavily  
His doors will open wide for you  
Goes to show what money can do  
Win again, lose again  
Don't feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
  
Please be kind to those  
Who fail to comprehend  
And in time, who knows  
You'll maybe make a friend  
  
If you leave your car  
And you're not going far  
Remember what time to be back  
If it slips your mind  
I'm sure in time you'll find  
A Rita waiting in a mac  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Win again, lose again  
Don't feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
Do the best you can
