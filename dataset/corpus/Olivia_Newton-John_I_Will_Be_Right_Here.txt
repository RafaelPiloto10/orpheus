How can I say, how much you've done for me  
How much I have just knowing I had you  
You touched my world and I'll never be the same  
You touched my heart and now everything has changed  
You are the one in this life I'll remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
There'll always be a part of you with me  
I hope there'll be a part of me with you  
Just call my name and I'll hear you on the wind  
Just close your eyes and I'll find you once again  
Just know that I'm on your side and remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
And when the wind touches you  
It will touch me too  
And the same star you see  
Will be the one that shines on me  
I'll be here when you need me  
I'll be here anytime  
Baby, I'm your side so remember  
I will be right here  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
I will be right here  
I will be right here
