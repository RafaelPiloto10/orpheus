There's coming a day when the world shall melt away  
And Jesus shall come to claim his own  
No more tears no pain no woe in this wicked world below  
Then will you be ready to go home  
Will you be ready to go ready to go home to live with him up there round the
throne  
When he says come unto me will your soul be claim and free  
Then will you be ready to go home  
  
In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too late  
Too late to claim the Savior for your own  
For he's coming someday to bear your soul away then will you be ready to go
home  
Will you be ready to go,  
Then will you be ready to go home
