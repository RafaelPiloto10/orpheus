The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night  
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My future it is revealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My fate is sealed  
  
If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today  
Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays  
The moon is red and bleeding  
The sun is burned and black  
The book of life is silent  
No turning back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade  
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate  
Is death another birthday?  
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?  
Do the undead live within us  
And look through our eyes?  
  
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust  
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?  
So I think I'll leave you  
With your bishops and your guilt  
So until the next time  
Have a good sin  
  
[Chorus]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Seven deadly sins  
Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell  
  
Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes  
Seven are your burning fires  
Seven your desires...
