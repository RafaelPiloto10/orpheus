Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me  
Riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee  
With a leg under the red dress I wish I could see  
Further North the warmth of lovin' lingering  
Now Johnny he be having lots of women  
Oh the reason he'd be smiling known to him  
  
On the left the girl in red so innocent  
Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed  
Yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin  
Can't help but wonder where and who she is  
Oh and the memory's always getting clearer  
First thirty years and more I've loved her so  
But now I need to know why she's with him  
  
And I sleep with the light on in case she comes  
And I sleep with the light on in case she,  
  
Recently as I was waiting on a dream  
She came to visit lost and lonely me  
Oh she leaned over the bed and with the lips above my head  
She asked if I had seen her Johnny  
Oh and I hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping  
Oh yeah I have been hoping that  
When she came that she would come for me  
  
Hey, hey,  
  
I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping  
That when she came she'd be coming just for me,  
I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping  
That when she came she'd be coming just for me,ah yeah!  
  
Aw yeah!  
Aw yeah!  
Hoo
