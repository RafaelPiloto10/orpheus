I stood in the doorway in my white nightgown  
Red roses on cotton, I stood three feet from the ground  
the grownups inside used words I didn't know  
But still I enjoyed the show  
  
They looked so lovely, they looked so self-assured  
And I just like them would know it all when I matured  
And I wouldn't be afraid of the darkness or the bears  
Or the cracks in the ceiling upstairs  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones, they call me a grownup  
  
Lat night at a friend's house a little girl was there  
She stood in the doorway playing with her hair  
She looked up to me as if I could do no wrong  
As I got up to sing my song  
  
I sang it with a shiver in my throat and in my knees  
Feeling just as small as a thistle in a breeze  
But the child's imagination carried me along  
And saw me through my song  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones call me a grownup
