Don't know what I'm doing - don't know where I'm going  
Leading me to ruin - I should have traded you in  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Don't know if I care - don't know if I'm there  
I just sit and stare - making love to thin air  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good --  
  
I do lots of good - surprised at what you would  
Don't call me no crud - I really think I'm good  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Try to call the tune - I'll probably go and rue it  
I'll just get it groomed - all sorts of other clues  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
  
I get by the local peer group and their pressures  
I can wash the dishes - my soups can taste delicious  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real  
Come on let's make a deal - think of where you live  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good --  
  
I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real  
Come on let's make a deal - think of what you need  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me
