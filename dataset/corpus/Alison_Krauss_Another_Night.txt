Wind is blowin' 'round the cabin  
I hate to hear that lonesome sound  
I'm all alone and so downhearted  
Since my true love she ain't around  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
She had no cause to go and leave me  
For I had never done her wrong  
She left our own little children  
Now with another man she's gone  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
Children they are sound asleepin'  
Oh they don't know that their mother's gone  
What will I do when they awaken?  
Can I tell them their mother's wrong?  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn
