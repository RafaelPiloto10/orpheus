[Verse 1]  
We consider every day a plus  
To spend it with a platypus  
We're always so ecstatic  
'Cause he's semi aquatic  
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus  
Brings smiles to the both of us  
Life's never fuddie duddy  
With our webfooted buddy  
When we're brushing our teeth, It's better  
Tying our shoes, It's better  
Combing our hair, It's better  
Like we're a cheese sandwich and he's the cheddar  
Blinking our eyes, It's better  
Breathing in and out, It's better  
Sitting in a chair, It's better  
And taking a bath is just a little bit wetter  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every day is such a dream  
When you start it with a monotreme  
He's duckbilled and he's beaver tailed and hairy  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better and we  
Just want to tell you Perry  
Everything's better with you.
