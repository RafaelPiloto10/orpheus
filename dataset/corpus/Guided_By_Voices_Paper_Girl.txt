Don't you call me up  
To tell me that you're lonely  
I won't make things up  
To tell you that they're only for you  
Cause that wouldn't make you feel any different about me  
Without me  
A message to the paper girl  
Don't fall apart so easily  
Don't cry too much you'll get all wet  
And that don't make much sense to me you see  
Cause that would mend my heart and I won't feel blue  
That's not true  
I need more but it's not like me to fuss  
With the problems of us  
When it's likely to be ??in this state with me??  
But here I go again  
And the paper girl's gonna blow away  
And it's one game that I won't play for you  
For you and me
