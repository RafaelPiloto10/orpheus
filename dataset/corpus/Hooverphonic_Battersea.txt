Battersea how it is  
It's over, forget  
Memories full of chocolate  
I've got to get over it, forget  
Your world is different than mine  
I've got to get over, I've got to forget  
And "Sgurd" is the one I don't like  
I'm afraid of him, I've got to forget  
  
Knocking on the blue water  
It's over, forget  
Praline and chocolate ice  
Got to get over, forget  
Your world doesn't match with mine  
I've got to get over, I've got to forget  
And "Sgurd" rules your friend's life  
I'm afraid of him, I've got to forget
