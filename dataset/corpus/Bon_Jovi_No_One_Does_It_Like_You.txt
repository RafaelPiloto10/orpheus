When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everythig,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
Someone's taken my place,  
Baby say it ain't true  
All your friends say you love him,  
Baby say it ain't true  
I close my eyes and I see your face  
Those memories lost that I can't replace  
Of all the crazy things that we do  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
I was wrong I must have been crazy  
Now I think I'm goin' out of my mind  
These thoughts of you are driving me crazy  
A girl like you is so hard to find  
  
When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everything,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
I try to find a girl to treat me right  
I take a different one home every night  
But no one makes my dreams come true  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you
