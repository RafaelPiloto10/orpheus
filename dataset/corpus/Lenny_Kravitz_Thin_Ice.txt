You must be walking  
On shaky ground  
You're always jumping  
At every sound  
  
You've been a hustler for all your days  
A real motherfucker in every way  
  
When you're a loser you're all alone  
So you made up for everything  
That you thought you'd lost  
But you paid a cost  
Hey ...  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
You're always running  
With every game  
First you're pushin' coke and then you're hoin' dames  
You say you can't give nothing better back  
  
Than you got back at home  
Well I tell you that's bullshit brother  
And that's a heavy load  
  
It's an illusion when you think you're the boss  
Oh no no no  
'Cause you really ain't got a thing  
But the crumbs you're tossed  
  
But don't you feel the frost  
Hey ...  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall
