I can't wait a day  
I don't care what you say  
Oh yeah, you got to pay  
When you hit rock bottom  
And you're there to stay  
Sometimes late at night  
I want to hold you tight  
Oh no, you got to pay  
Girl, you hit rock bottom  
And you're there to stay  
Rock bottom  
Girl, you know you oughta treat me good  
Rock bottom  
Oh, you never treat me like you should  
Hard times got me down  
Good times ain't around  
Now I got the mind to say  
Girl, you hit rock bottom  
And you're there to stay  
Rock bottom  
Girl, you know you oughta treat me good  
Rock bottom  
Yeah, you never treat me like you should  
Rock bottom  
Girl, you know you oughta treat me good  
Rock bottom  
Yeah, you never treat me like you should  
Rock bottom  
Rock bottom, ow
