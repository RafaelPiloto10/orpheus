The days are okay  
I watch the T.V. in the afternoon  
If I get lonely  
The sound of other voices  
Other rooms are near to me  
I'm not afraid  
  
The operator  
She tells the time  
It's good for a laugh  
And there's always radio  
And for a dime I can talk to God  
Dial-a-prayer  
Are you there?  
Do you care?  
Are you there?  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
I am wiser now you know  
And still as big a fool concerning you  
  
I met your friend  
She's very nice, what can I say?  
It was an accident  
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way  
You're looking well  
I'm not afraid, yeah  
  
You have a lovely home  
Just like a picture  
No, I live alone  
I found it easier  
You must remember how I never liked the party life  
Up all night  
Lovely wife  
You have a lovely wife  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together, now  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together,
