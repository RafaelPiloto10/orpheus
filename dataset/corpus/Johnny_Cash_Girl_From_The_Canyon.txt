The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home  
As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own  
Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain  
Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane  
These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand  
Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land  
I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead  
The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead  
The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I had done  
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun  
The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one  
An outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head  
We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said  
And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride  
The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side  
The girl from the canyon  
  
She was the only one
