Here we go (here we go) here we go again  
Dirty knickers pop music vodka and gin  
Your knees are sore you must?ve been in the wars  
There's something to celebrate in our lives and  
here's where it begins  
Oh well see how we've grown  
One is born every minute  
you're never never alone  
One is born - every minute of the day  
Dosey clocks to cause the volatile tots to  
Sleep together if or never we're on this then  
Oh here we go, here we go, here we go again  
Dirty knickers pop music vodka beer and gin  
Oh well see how we've grown  
One is born every minute  
you're never never alone  
One is born - every minute of the day
