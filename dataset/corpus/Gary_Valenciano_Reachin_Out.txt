I.  
What must I do to make you understand?  
You mean everything to me  
Don't have the strength to say  
Give this heart of mine a chance  
And maybe then you will see  
  
Refrain 1:  
And I'll do anything, do anything that you tell me  
And I'll be there, I'll be there if you need me  
  
Chorus 1:  
Reachin' out to you  
Do you feel it too?  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure  
I've never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
Ii.  
What must I do so I can make you see?  
The light that shines in my eyes  
You brighten up my day  
You even help me find my way  
I wish you're always by my side  
  
Refrain 2:  
And I can't stop, don't know how to stop thinkin' of you  
And I'll do anything, do anything to be near, near you  
  
Chorus 2:  
Reachin' out to you  
Do you feel it too?  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure  
I've never felt this way before  
Deep inside you know that there is something more  
  
Repeat chorus 2  
  
Deep inside you know that there is something more
