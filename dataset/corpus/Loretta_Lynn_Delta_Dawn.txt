Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on could it be a faded rose from days
gone by  
And did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky  
  
She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her baby  
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy  
Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand  
Lookin' for a mysterious dark haired man  
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn  
Prettiest woman you ever had laid eyes upon  
But a man of low degree stood by her side promised her he'd take her for his
bride  
Delta Dawn what's that flower...  
Delta Dawn what's that flower...  
Delta Dawn
