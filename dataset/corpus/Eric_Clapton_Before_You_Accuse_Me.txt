[Chorus]  
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself  
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself  
You say I've been spending my money on other women  
You've been taking money from someone else  
  
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago  
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago  
Well your mother said "Son"  
"Don't call my daughter no more"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come back home baby, try my love one more time  
Come back home baby, try my love one more time  
If I don't go on and quit you  
I'm gonna lose my mind  
  
[Chorus]
