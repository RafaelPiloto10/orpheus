Baby you know that there's no choice  
I'm tired of hearing my own voice  
We can't live on love alone  
To find some work I'll have to leave our home  
And I know that things look desperate now  
But stand by me we'll get through somehow  
Ooh when you touch me it all fades away  
Ooh when you hold me I'll make it through another day  
Winter's here and it's looking bleak  
The snow is falling as we speak  
And can we cut back a little more  
Something will turn up I'm really sure  
So please darlin' keep your faith in me  
I'll make it good you wait and see  
Ooh when you touch me it all fades away  
Ooh when you hold me I'll make it through another day  
Winter's here and it's looking bleak  
The snow is falling as we speak  
And can we cut back a little more  
Something will turn up I'm really sure  
So please darlin' keep your faith in me  
I'll make it good you wait and see  
It's so special, oh so special  
Cause there's always you and me  
And we stand alone with our love  
So strong, bold and free  
It's so special, oh so special  
You can't take that away  
There's a bond that holds us together  
It'll always stay  
  
Though I'm getting stronger every day  
Situations change, I hope and pray  
I'm not a man who's afraid to fight  
With you beside me I'll see the light  
We'll be together, I'm sure it's meant to be  
A friend and lover my only loyalty  
If nothing else, it's you and me.
