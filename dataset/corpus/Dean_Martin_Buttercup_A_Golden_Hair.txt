(Buttercup Buttercup Buttercup I love you)  
Buttercup a golden hair  
I'm feeling blue  
Buttercup don't you know  
I got to follow where you go  
Buttercup I need you so  
I love you  
Buttercup a golden hair  
My love is true  
Buttercup can't you see  
You mean the world to me  
Buttercup a golly gee  
I love you  
Every night I dream and dream and dream and dream about you  
Even when I sleep I cannot do without you  
Oh tell me Buttercup a golden hair  
What shall I do  
Buttercup I know I'll die  
If you should ever say goodbye  
Buttercup oh my oh my do I love you  
(Buttercup oh my oh my do I love you)  
Buttercup oh my oh my do I love you
