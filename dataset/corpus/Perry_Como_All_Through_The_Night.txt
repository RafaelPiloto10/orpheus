Sleep my child and peace attend thee,  
All through the night  
Guardian angels God will send thee,  
All through the night  
  
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,  
Hill and vale in slumber steeping,  
I my loving vigil keeping,  
All through the night  
  
While the moon her watch is keeping,  
All through the night  
While the weary world is sleeping,  
All through the night  
  
O'er thy spirit gently stealing,  
Visions of delight revealing,  
Breathes a pure and holy feeling,  
All through the night
