Somewhere between her blue eyes and jeans  
There's a heart, that's been broken  
Along with her dreams.  
And tonight she's out dancing  
Drinking and thinking  
Feeling a feeling,  
Between her blue eyes and jeans.  
  
She looks just like an angel  
In a big ole cloud of lonesome  
Reflecting her memory  
Round a golden wedding ring.  
  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans.  
  
Somewhere between, her blue eyes and jeans  
There's a heart, that's been broken  
Along with her dreams  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans.  
  
Somewhere between, her blue eyes and jeans  
There's a heart, that's been broken  
Along with her dreams.  
And tonight some dance hall doctor  
Might break the chains that locked her  
To that lonesome old feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans.  
  
She's healing a feeling  
Between her blue eyes and jeans
