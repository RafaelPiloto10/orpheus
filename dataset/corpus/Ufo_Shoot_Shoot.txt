Was a fast tough woman loved to play the clown  
You won't do nothin' about it  
Break a good boy's resistance down  
Know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
She said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
Convinced me that she was worth it  
Never knew I was her kill  
And two 45's would do the trick and pay the bills  
  
know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now  
  
Holding out in my hotel room police they finally come  
Had her as the prosecution, and my prints upon the gun  
  
know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now
