(.. Dahinter schimmern die sterne)  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison  
I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den  
I hang out here every nite  
I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting for you  
You gonna like what i..., you gonna like it  
You gonna like what I do  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison, I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
It offers you comfort  
As everything about it  
It is mild, without reason  
And for all it is perfect  
And it is there, where I go now  
And it is there, where I now go  
And it is there, where I now go  
It is there... Where i... Now... Go..
