Who gives you the right to come here and tell me  
I have to leave this place my home  
To you it's a jungle, to me it's a kingdom  
Where (my) people are free there to roam  
Born with the stars we are happy and peaceful  
'Til now we were left undisturbed  
But you rupture the forests our gardens  
And fill them with filth from your cities unheard  
  
Savage, who is savage  
Leave your morals, stake your claim  
Savage, you are savage  
Modern man can take the blame  
  
You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress  
Baptizing our blood with disease  
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering  
Saying then that your god is well-pleased  
What have we done to deserve such injustice  
Explain to us please if you can  
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes  
Of us both who's the primitive man  
  
Savage, who is savage

Savage, savage  
Who's the savage  
Modern man  
Who's the savage  
Modern man
