Worry the bottle Mamma, it's grapefruit wine  
Kick off your high heel sneakers, it's party time  
The girls don't seem to care what's on  
As long as it plays till dawn  
Nothin' but blues and Elvis  
And somebody else's favorite song  
  
Give her some funked up music, she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice  
The girls don't seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM - no static at all  
  
Give her some funked up music she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae she'll love you twice  
The girls don't seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM - no static at all
