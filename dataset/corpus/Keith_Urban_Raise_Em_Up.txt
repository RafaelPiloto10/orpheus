Raise 'em up  
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night  
The band plays a song you like and you sing along  
  
Raise em up  
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck  
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on  
  
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico  
Its just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast  
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky  
A comin' home, you've been gone too long  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise 'em up  
  
Raise 'em up  
You got a voice, you got a choice  
Go make some noise  
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are  
Raise 'em up  
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth  
Its what you do  
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars  
  
Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain  
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace  
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky  
As the flag flies, say goodbye  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise 'em up  
  
So, you meet someone  
The only one  
You take her by the hand  
Make a stand  
Buy some land  
Make some love  
And them babies come  
  
Raise 'em up  
Raise 'em up  
Raise 'em up trophy high  
Raise 'em up to the sky  
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile  
Raise 'em up tall and strong  
Raise 'em up right from wrong  
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along  
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah, woah
