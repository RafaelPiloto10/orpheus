A year before I thought of leaving  
I can't remember what I did  
Us in bed a made n' veil basement  
When you left  
Western winter  
I hear clatter  
Morning dawning  
Nothing matters  
  
When we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad you came  
  
Some of us fell by the wayside  
Others had it and threw it away  
Some caried on pretending  
They think they still have it today  
The once admired  
Look oh so tired  
Loose it on  
In the night time  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad I came  
  
Took me years to find my own song  
And for years I've thought just sing along  
But the words that were wrong  
The tune that's true lives on and on  
They'll still be here when I'm gone  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad we came  
  
And we take a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd like to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad I came
