Holding you, you holding me,  
Everyone could see we were in ecstasy.  
Making love against the wall,  
Feeling very small when we didn't need to be.  
  
[Chorus]  
Easy now, don't let my love flow out of you.  
Please remember that I want you to come too.  
  
Oh my darling, help me please.  
When I'm without you I fall down and graze my knees.  
I look so funny and I feel sad,  
Your love is all I've ever had, so please don't tease.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday, you know tomorrow,  
Could it be I'll have to borrow someone new?  
I know that I'm the one to blame,  
But all the same, there must be something you can do.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]
