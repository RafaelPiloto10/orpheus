Don't remind me  
That some days I'm the windshield  
And other days I'm just a lucky bug  
These cold iron rails  
Leave old mossy trails  
Through the countryside  
The crow and the beanfield  
Are my best friends, but boy I need a hug  
  
(Boy I need a hug)  
  
'Cause my heart stops without you  
There's something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
Don't remind me  
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky  
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about  
'Cause when the stars silhouette me  
I'm scared they'll forget me and flicker out  
I taste honey but I haven't seen the hive  
Yeah, I didn't look, I didn't even try  
  
But still my heart stops without you  
'Cause there's something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
We are honey and the bee  
  
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me  
I fell in love with you like bees to honey  
Let's up and leave the weeping to the willow tree  
And pour our tears in the sea  
  
I swear  
There's a lot of vegetables out there  
That crop up for air  
Yeah, I never thought  
We were two peas in a pod  
To be suddenly bloomed  
And I knew that I'd always love you  
  
Oh, I'll always love you too  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If I reached for your hand for the rest of my life  
Who knew the other side could be so green
