The first time I laid my eyes on you I knew  
We'd spend this life side by side  
I still feel the same though you're so far away  
I swear that you'll always be my  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday we'll be together  
Forever love  
I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Minutes and hours and years may go by  
But my heart knows nothing of time  
So don't cry just keep me right here in your dreams  
And hold on to these words of mine  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday we'll be together  
Forever love  
I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Love is the road to our destiny  
Nothing can change what is meant to be  
Forever love  
  
Oh, I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
Forever love  
Forever love
