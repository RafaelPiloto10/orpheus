The clouds are rollin' in  
Who will watch them?  
The waves are strong  
The boat is gone  
I hope they're swimming  
  
Little boy lost in the woods  
Where's the clearing?  
The town is out  
They're calling loud  
But he's not hearing  
  
It seems to me I'm always miles away  
Looking for my old face  
  
Save me from myself  
I can't relate  
We're mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
There's nothing left  
Inside for me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
The bullet in the yard  
Is slowly rusting  
The bottles crack  
The kid's come back  
And I'm just looking  
  
The wine is on the floor  
The candles flicker  
Your eyes fall  
And I'm appalled  
It's all just cinder  
  
It seems to me we're always miles apart  
Trying to find another place to start  
  
Save me from myself  
I can't relate  
We're mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
There's nothing left  
Inside for me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
The sailors never left  
They knew the weather  
When they were found  
They were having drinks together  
  
They found the little boy  
In the grocery  
Happy endings all around  
And still they haunt me  
  
Save me from myself  
I can't relate  
We're mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
There's nothing left  
Inside of me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
Save me from myself  
There's nothing left inside me  
There's nothing left
