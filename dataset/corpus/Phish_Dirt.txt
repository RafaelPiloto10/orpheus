Washed up on shore  
Washed up on shore  
  
I'd like to live beneath the dirt  
A tiny space to move and breathe is all that I would ever need  
I want to live beneath the dirt  
Where I'd be free from push and shove like all those swarming up above  
Beneath your heals I'll spend my time  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
I'll wiggle in the earth and dew  
Shout your name into the wind  
And sometimes I will think of you  
Shout your name into the wind  
And if you ever think of me  
Kneel down and kiss the earth  
And show me what this thought is worth  
I'll never hear your voice again  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind
