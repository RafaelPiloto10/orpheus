Listen to the voice of Buddha  
Saying stop your sericulture  
Little people like your offspring  
Boiled alive for some gods stocking  
Buddha's watching, Buddha's waiting  
  
Just because the kid's an orphan  
Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying  
People don't forget this torture  
Just because you call her mother  
Doesn't mean that she's your better  
  
Once more with the voice of Buddha  
He'll say carry on your slaughter  
Who cares for the little children  
You may slice with no conviction  
Blind revenge on a blameless victim  
  
Listen to the voice of Buddha  
Saying stop your sericulture  
He'll say carry on your slaughter  
Who cares for the little children  
You may slice with no conviction  
Blind revenge on a blameless victim
