[Chorus]  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
But when evening comes around and it's time to hit the town  
Where do you go  
You gotta rock it  
  
The old folks say that you gotta end your date by ten  
But if you're out on a date don't you bring her home late 'cause it's a sin  
You know there's no excuse, you know you're gonna lose, you never win  
I'll say it again  
  
And it's all because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone gather round let me tell you all about it  
You see I pulled into a drive-in and I found a place to park  
We hopped into the backseat where it's always nice and dark  
We're just about to move thinkin' "Bret, this is a breeze"  
There's a light in my eye and a guy says "Out of the car, long hair!"  
  
Oowee, you're coming with me  
Said the local police  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Play me a little C.C.  
  
Your Mama don't dance, no  
She just don't dance, no  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
Ah, yeah
