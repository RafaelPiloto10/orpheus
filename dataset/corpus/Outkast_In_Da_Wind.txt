[Talking]  
Hah, haha  
That's just the sound of the Hen'..  
True Story.. Buddy Roe..  
They say tell the truth, Shane and them (uh-huh)  
Thank God for the thugs too...  
  
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]  
Drop the top and let the sunshine in  
With the woodgrain, let the twinkies spin  
Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Hen'  
It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind,  
With the 'dro in the wind  
  
[Trick Daddy]  
I'm a ol' sneaky, ol' freaky, ol' geechy-ass nigga  
Collard green, neckbone-eatin-ass nigga  
Always wearin my jeans baggy saggy  
You know Florida, Georgia, South Cakalaky  
Growed up eatin spam sandwiches  
Sugar water and mayonnaise sandwich  
Share the room with bout four mo' brothers  
But one home for 'em and wattn't no mo' covers  
A little bad motherfucker (ah-ha)  
Always rude and always in trouble  
None of my teachers ain't like me (uh-huh)  
But make it so bad, Pearl had seven mo' like me  
If you growed up the way I did  
You gotsta understand, Trick love the kids  
(Ooooooohh!) Trick love the kids  
  
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]  
  
[Trick Daddy]  
Cop me a seven-tres Chevy, put dubs on that bitch (uh-huh)  
Candy-apple green, niggaz lovin this shit (lovin this shit)  
And when I'm in it, I'll act a fool  
Ya don't like how I'm livin? Bitch fuck you (uh-huh)  
That's right I'm a rude-ass nigga  
Quick to do you, cut a fool-ass nigga  
Weighin' in at bout a buck six-five  
And a nigga can fuck, plus the boy gets live (that's right)  
You know legs, wings, and short thighs (short thighs)  
Eat 'em up, beat 'em up, then switch sides  
  
[Cee-Lo]  
Hot whore work her Sean John velour to the floor  
He oughta enjoy, with the loaded four-four  
Be sure and acquire more 'fore ya fuck with mine  
Disrespect
