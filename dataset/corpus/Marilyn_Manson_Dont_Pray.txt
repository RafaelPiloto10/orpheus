An extra mile across the line, I kiss my Judas one more time  
I die for your sin  
Life is simple, life is sweet  
The perspective from down on your knees will kill you from within  
Fortune and fame, torture and shame  
Think twice before you speak  
Glory and blame, it's all the same  
My game is your defeat  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't care what book you quote  
Your poison is my antidote  
I don't burn and I don't bleed  
Wrap that guilt up deep inside  
Religion has an alibi  
What more could you need  
Fortune and fame, torture and shame  
You still don't understand  
Glory and blame, it's all the same  
Some things go hand in hand  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me  
Sacrifice the innocence  
Will you illiminate the decadance  
You celebrate the enemy  
We'll blind your eyes and steal your dreams  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me
