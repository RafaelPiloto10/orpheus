Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day  
That's the island greeting that we send to you from the land where palm trees
sway  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you
