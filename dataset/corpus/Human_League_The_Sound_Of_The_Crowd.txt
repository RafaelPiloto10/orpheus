Put your hand in a party wave  
Pass around  
Make a shroud pulling combs through a backwash frame  
Find the copies in a carbon mount  
Pass around  
Stroke a pocket with a print of a laughing sound  
  
Get around town, get around town  
Where the people look good  
Where the music is loud  
Get around town  
No need to stand proud  
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd  
  
The shades from a pencil peer  
Pass around  
A fold in an eyelid brushed with fear  
The lines on a compact guide  
Pass around  
A hat with alignment worn inside  
  
Get in line now, get in line now  
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme  
Get around town, get around town  
Where the people look good  
Where the music is loud  
Get around town  
No need to stand proud  
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd
