I can't break away from you  
Ooh, there's something  
About you that I can't explain  
I get excited when I hear your name  
I can't break away from you  
  
Deep in my mind you're always here  
Whenever I turn you're always near  
Oh, just can't, just can't, just can't  
I've only known you for a little while  
Yet, I can truly say I dig your style  
Even the way you call my name  
  
It sounds like a song the angels sang  
Just being near you gives me satisfaction  
I tell you it's some new kind of action  
Your love I could never, ever turn away  
Why don't you hear me when I try to say  
I can't break away from you  
  
You're like a mirror in the back of my mind  
I see reflections of you all the time  
I can't break away from you  
Deep in my mind you're always there  
You stay around me everywhere  
Yeah, baby, oh, yeah  
  
(We have a different style of love)  
Different (So different, and so new)  
(We have a crazy kind of love) So crazy  
(Crazy, yes it's true)  
(And I'm gonna never turn away)  
  
Oh, do you hear what I say  
I can't break away from you  
You're like a mirror in the back of my mind  
I see reflections of you all the time  
  
I can't break away, no, from you  
Deep in my mind you're always there  
Whenever I turn you're always here  
Oh, you can't, never get away from you  
  
(I can't break away)  
When I rise in the morning  
(I can't break away)  
You, you, you, oh, you, you got the power  
  
(I can't break away)  
Each and every hour, hey, babe  
(I can't break away)  
You been a mighty good leader, oh, yeah  
  
(I can't break away)  
You been a mighty good leader, well  
(I can't break away)  
You saved my soul, yes, you did  
(I can't break away)  
Oh, ho, ho, you been a mighty good leader, well
