Guernica is in fact made of stone backwards.  
Watch me at war really up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores that's us  
He wanted us he swore and all we've got  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores that's us  
Simple lives yeah we don't have  
We pack up in truth it seems this  
Peacemakers has arms that hold fear  
See gargoyles can you see the wonder?  
Yes I fear the carbine  
What does never wrong mean?  
That's right  
Every one of us he swore so hurry up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
Both of us are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores  
That must mean sinful eyes that maim of fear  
It's the look that stings I fear boy  
Being distrusting I trust no one  
They've been back down for nothing  
It was never shared it's ours  
We will know those names who follow
