Vs. 1  
Salvation rise,  
As we sing of your freedom  
We leave the past behind,  
As we look to your kingdom  
  
Vs. 2  
You bridge a great divide,  
Between our hearts and your glory  
Our shame dissolves,  
In the depths of your mercy

We are devoted,  
Ooo  
We are devoted to you  
  
Chorus  
Your light will shine in the darkness  
Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark  
Whoa  
We are yours

Fill the open skies,  
With the sound of your praises  
Our future lies,  
In the hope of our saviour
