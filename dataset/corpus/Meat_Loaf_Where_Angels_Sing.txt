This song was dedicated to Valeria M.  
Meet me downtown on the corner.  
I'll be waiting in a big yellow cab.  
Don't bring a suitcase.  
You won't need a thing.  
There'll be no worries.  
Where angels sing.  
I got my ticket in my hand.  
Oh, the price is paid in full.  
No man can stop me.  
Their words won't sting you.  
No dreams will haunt you.  
Where angels sing.  
I get so weary.  
On this troubled road.  
Unlock these chains.  
And gently rock me home.  
Beyond the clouds and the rain  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.  
Where lies can't hurt you.  
The flesh desert me.  
No in or out.  
No loss or doubt.  
No living with or doing without.  
Where money ain't the power king.  
And kindness is the most precious thing.  
Where angels sing.  
Oh, where angels sing.  
Where time means nothing.  
No hustle.  
No one rushing.  
No dark of night.  
No hate or spite.  
No wrong or right.  
No day or night.  
No towns or no cities.  
There's no pain, no pity.  
Where hunger is no longer.  
And a good man just gets stronger.  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.  
Where angels sing.
