  
I've been accused of everything  
From Timbuktu to old Berlin  
I need some armor for my flesh  
I need to stop and take a rest  
I've been wide-eyed but couldn't see  
I stand accused of being me  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline  
When I hear a baby cry  
When I see an old man die:  
That's just the way it is  
  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Yeah, that's the way it is  
  
I took each day the way it came  
I put my future out of frame  
The signs were there for all to see:  
Light through our line to you and me  
  
My hand laid on my beating breast  
I swear to you I'll pass this test  
I'll walk one hundred thousand miles  
Ignore the judges 'til my trial  
It might try  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is just a den of vice and sin  
But even on the darkest night  
We could reach for the light  
And we could get it right  
  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
We could get it right  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline  
Ten thousand years ago  
Crawling on the floor  
Well, get up, Jack  
It's time to rock the shack  
  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
It's time to get up
