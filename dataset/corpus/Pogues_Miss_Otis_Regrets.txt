Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
She is sorry to be delayed,  
But last night down in Lover's Lane she strayed,  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone,  
Madam,  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray,  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail,  
Madam,  
They strung her upon  
The old willow across the way,  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her head and cried,  
Madam,  
"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today."
