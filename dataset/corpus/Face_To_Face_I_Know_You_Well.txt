Try not to try  
Try not to care  
It's really easy once you learn  
That no one is listening  
  
Try not to give  
Try not to help  
You'll do much better for yourself  
Because nothing else matters  
  
I know you well by now  
You're that good person  
  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be naive  
You think you're better than me  
Well you're sadly mistaken  
  
I know you well by now  
You're that good person  
  
It's all the same inside our minds  
Everything is justified  
What is wrong and what is right  
Everything is justified
