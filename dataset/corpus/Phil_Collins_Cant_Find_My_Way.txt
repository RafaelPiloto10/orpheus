'To try to do the right thing, always the right thing.'  
  
I've been doing some thinking, here on my own  
It's been on my mind  
This debt I owe to you  
I have to repay in kind  
  
But I can't find my way  
  
Tired and weary, I follow the path  
That leads to your door  
But it occurred to me, all that I have  
Is already yours  
  
But I can't find my way  
  
Oh, just to sit a while  
Oh, just to sit and watch you smile  
  
But I can't find my way  
  
Keep the faith you say  
To keep the faith I pray  
Be strong you say  
Just follow the light  
  
Wheels keep turning but the close I get  
The farther I seem  
Peace will only come  
Finding the peace within  
  
But I can't find my way
