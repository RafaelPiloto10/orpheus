High flyers, wailing birds  
I'm so far out to sea  
Ships are passing every night  
Oh, all my boyish dreams  
  
And your every melody  
With the sea tides tossin' free  
Never, never holdin' back  
Rock and rollers drift by  
  
Turn to summer, goes so fast  
Seems I'll never see you  
One weekend and a photograph  
Oh, all my boyish dreams  
  
And your every melody  
With the sea tides tossin' free  
Never, never holdin' back  
Rock and rollers drift by
