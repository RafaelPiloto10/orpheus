Well, some contend that this rock n' roll  
Is bad for the body, bad for the soul  
Bad for the heart, bad for the mind  
Bad for the deaf and bad for the blind  
It makes some men crazy and then they talk like fools  
It makes some men crazy and then they start to drool  
  
Unscrupulous operators could confuse  
Could exploit and deceive  
The conditional reflex theories  
Change the probabilities, I said it's a  
Crass and raucous crackass place  
With a Pavlov on the human race  
It's a terrible illness, a terrible case  
And usually permanent when it takes place  
  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown
