And I want to wake up in your  
White, white sun  
And I want to wake up in your world  
With no pain  
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday  
While you are numb all of the way  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
No  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
Now I am resigned  
Wicked fuckin' worlds  
On its way to Hell  
Livin' are dead and  
I hope to join them too  
I know what to do? And I do it well  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
No  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Oh yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you
