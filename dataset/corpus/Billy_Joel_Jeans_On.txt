When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
  
It's the weekend, and I know that you're free  
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun and the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, got a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
I'll meet ya in the usual place  
I don't need a thing, 'cept your pretty face  
And I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun and the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
