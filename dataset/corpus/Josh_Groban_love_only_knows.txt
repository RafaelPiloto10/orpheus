I've tried to hold this back so long  
And we're always such a good thing when it's gone  
Would it be alright, if we just left our heads tonight  
  
Take me away from this old game  
Of saying that we're both too much the same  
  
Would it be alright, if I just stayed with you tonight  
And before I go, will I ever see you again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows  
If we'll give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows  
If it's special enough then we'll chose one another  
We'll chose each other  
  
You were the secret I loved to keep  
The name I would only sing in my sleep  
Would it be alright, if we just lose ourselves tonight  
And if you let go, will you reach out again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows, if we'll give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows, if it's special enough then we'll chose one another  
We'll choose each other  
  
And I can't breathe without you and I don't  
And I can't live without love and I won't  
And I won't  
  
Love only knows  
If we'll give into fear and choose life undercover  
She said love only knows if it's special enough then we'll choose one another  
Love only knows, how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me under  
She said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each other  
And we need each other  
  
And I can't live without you and I won't
