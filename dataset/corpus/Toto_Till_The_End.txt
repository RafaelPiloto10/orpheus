I know what's on your mind  
Let's lay it on the line  
All the things were missin'  
Look I just came back to town  
Drink that green dragon down  
It's time for me talk and you to listen  
I know my heart, I know it well  
Bet your analyst forgot to ask that question  
We're at the start and time will tell  
  
[Chorus]  
Till the end  
Your name will touch my lips like prayin'  
Till the end  
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'  
Till the end  
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken  
Till the end  
We'll be the ones who hold the key to a lock that's open  
  
Girl not so long ago  
A boy that didn't know  
That he was hurtin'  
Pushed somebody down  
They fell and hit the gound  
But i never meant for you to be that person  
You know my heart, you know me well  
It's never been my style to take advantage  
We're at the start and time will tell
