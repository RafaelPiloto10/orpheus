You ask me why I'm broken hearted  
Why, I've she'd a million tears sweetheart, for you  
It's not easy when the love you've cherished  
Proves falsehearted, careless and untrue.  
  
You built a chain around my heart, dear  
But each link was only sorrow and regret  
For you taught my aching heart to love you  
But you never taught it to forget.  
  
I've tried in vain to find a new love  
That would take your place and teach me to forget  
But I find you'll always have my heart, dear  
I must live in memories of regret.  
  
Tho' darling, there's one consolation  
In my dreams I know I'll find you waiting there  
But I'll wake to find each new tomorrow  
Saddened by a broken love affair...
