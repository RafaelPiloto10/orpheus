Oh come back baby,  
Oh mama please don't go.  
Child, the way I love you,  
Well, you'll never know, oh.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back baby,  
Yeah yeah,  
Let's talk it over one more time.  
  
Well I admit, baby,  
That I was wrong.  
Don't you know, baby,  
Child you've been gone too long.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said if I could holler  
Like a mountain jack,  
I'd go up on the mountain,  
People, I'd call my baby back, oh.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now one of these days, baby,  
And it won't be long, yeah.  
You're gonna look for me, child, you know,  
And I'll be gone.  
So  
  
[Chorus]
