Look at you  
With all your shiny  
Toys for boys  
It's all unnerving  
  
Bold and new  
But dark and spotty  
The toys enjoy  
The undeserving  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah  
  
Fat the world  
Then sink your teeth in  
Cannibal and missionary  
Toes are curled  
My thanks uneven  
When tales so tall  
Are ordinary  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah
