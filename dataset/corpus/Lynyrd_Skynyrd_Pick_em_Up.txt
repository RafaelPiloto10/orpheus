Well sometimes I lose my direction  
And sometimes I jump off track  
But when I hide out baby, I can always get it back  
I need to feel the cool breeze,  
In my face, the rumble of the engine, between my legs  
Hey little sister you can color me gone  
  
[Chorus]  
So if I want to stay out all night long you can't stop me from runnin wild,  
Don't you worry how long I'm gone, I come back every once in a while  
I pick em up, and lay em all down  
I never like my feet to ever hit the ground  
Don't miss when I'm gone 'cause I'll be around,  
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up, and lay me on down  
  
Now I know that I got me a good life,  
Jim Bean, and women they treat me right  
I make my own rules, like it or not  
Now don't misunderstand me baby, I give in every once in a while,  
Well its times like honey, I'll leave you with a smile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been here, I've been there, I've been everywhere,  
I wouldn't tell you no lies,  
And just like me you're a wild one,  
Won't you take me for a ride  
I pick em up, and lay em all down  
I don't like my feet to ever hit the ground,  
Don't miss me while I'm gone 'cause I'll be around yeah  
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up,  
And lay me on down
