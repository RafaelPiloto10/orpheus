Life is so peculiar  
You get so wet in the rain, you know I do  
You get so warm in the sunshine, get my sun tan  
It doesn't pay to complain, I never complain  
  
When I get up each morning  
There's nothing to breathe but air, yeah  
And when I look in the mirror  
There's nothing to comb but hair  
  
And when I sit down to breakfast  
There's nothing to eat but food  
Life is so peculiar  
But you can't stay home and brood  
  
Oh, life, tell 'em about it pops, is so peculiar  
The desert's only got sand, and that's grand  
The oceans only got water, and you can't drink it all up  
And you never know where you stand  
  
When I get out to dinner  
There's nothing to wear but clothes, yeah  
And whenever I get sleepy  
There's nothing to do but doze, yeah  
  
And whenever I get thirsty  
There's nothing to do but drink  
Life is no peculiar  
That it makes you stop and think  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar, sure it is  
A fork belongs with the knife, it sure does  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage, I love cabbage  
Husband should have a wife  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
That's life  
  
Life, yes life, it's so peculiar  
A bird can usually sing, no words, I do too  
A pearl is made by an oyster, New Orleans? Rampart Street  
You can't be sure of a thing  
  
When I get tired of restin'  
There's nothing to do but walk, walk it off pop  
And when I don't care to listen  
There's nothing to do but talk, keep you big mouth shut  
  
When I'm up in the airplane  
There's nothing to do but fly  
Life is so peculiar  
But I often wonder why  
  
Oh, life, is so peculiar, sure it is  
A fork belongs with a knife, you know  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage, leftover cabbage? Yeah  
A husband should have a wife  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
That's life  
  
One more for me Jim, that's life  
Let me hear it one time, that's life  
All together, that's life, yeah!
