I dreamed of my old lover last night  
I wonder if I spoke out loud  
And if by chance my husband overheard  
He put my face back in the crowd  
  
His eyes were clear and gentle then  
He kissed the troubles from my brow  
I long to fall to sleep again  
And I wonder how he would look now  
  
Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?  
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?  
I like the way it feels but then  
I rarely dream of anyone  
  
In the songs of shame and the tales of dread  
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead  
And all the vines wind through their eyes  
Oh but no one knows this passion now  
Oh no one knows this passion now  
  
So I keep this fancy to myself  
I keep my lipstick twisted tight  
I long to fall to sleep again  
I dreamed of my old lover last night  
I long to fall to sleep again  
'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night
