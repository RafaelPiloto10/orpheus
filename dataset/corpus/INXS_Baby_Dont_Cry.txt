[Chorus: x6]  
Baby don't cry  
  
When you're down and confused  
Nothing seems right  
And it's you who decides  
Who's going to make it right  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Well life ain't no joke  
But it's good when you smile  
Steal everything  
But you won't get far  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Sometimes you will fall  
What cha gonna do?  
Give your friend a call  
  
[Chorus: x6]  
  
We know that you can smile  
Even though it takes a while  
To lose your fears and say  
Gonna lose your fears and say  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Do you know who you are  
And where you're going to  
Don't you know that love  
Gonna pull you  
Gonna pull you through now baby  
  
[Chorus: x6]  
  
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry [Repeat: x4]  
  
Face to face  
Anything is possible  
Not political, or analytical  
Never giving up on the wrong  
You got a choice  
Why don't you use it  
Change, is an attitude  
Guaranteed to take hold of you  
So welcome, to the turnstile  
Take a turn with a new vow  
Hey, I know what you know  
All the sympathy  
Made a mess of me  
Respect the sacrifice  
Before the number one  
Now it has begun  
  
[Chorus: x4]
