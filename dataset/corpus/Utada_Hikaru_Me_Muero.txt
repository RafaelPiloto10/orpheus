Everyday in my life's in shambles  
It's easy, took the love away  
I got nothing left to gamble  
I've thrown it all away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now and then I'm suicidal  
Flirting with a new temptation  
Happiness inside a bottle is what I need today  
Oh my lover's gone away, gone to Istanbul  
Light as a feather  
I lie in my bed and flip through TV channels  
Eating Godiva  
I'm smoking my days away reading old emails  
In my old pajamas  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero  
  
Loneliness makes it's arrival  
Depression starts to settle in  
Try to go where no one'll write her  
And do some crazy thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the good stuff, oh my lover  
Lover  
Smoking, I'm smoking my days away  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero  
What a day  
  
Gone away... yeah  
Doctor, doctor  
You give me my lover  
Oh yeah  
Oh my lover  
Gone, gone away  
My lover, gone away  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero
