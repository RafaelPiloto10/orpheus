You said that you loved me,  
And I thought that it was true.  
You said that you needed me,  
And baby I believed that too.  
  
I thought that you were shy,  
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye.  
I should've known better,  
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling everybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
You can have my credit card baby,  
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady.  
All I know is what I see,  
You're getting what you want and girl it ain't just me.  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away...  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?  
  
Don't say that you love me,  
Because I know that it's not true.  
Just tell me you need my money,  
Girl you know I'll give it to you.  
  
Between the ocean and the sky  
There are things that you can't buy.  
And if you look you'll see  
One of them is me.  
Take you hands out of my pockets  
Digging till the day you die.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling anybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the things that you've made for yourself,  
You've gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf.  
You've gotta stay  
Oh yeah,  
Well, that's OK  
It's just a game that we play.  
  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away.  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?
