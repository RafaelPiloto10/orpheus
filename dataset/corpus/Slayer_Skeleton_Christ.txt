Unbound God's creation  
Has grown into the sinner  
Abandoned innocence  
Impenitent transgressor  
Escape mortality  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn in God's eyes  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
Life's too short to be focused on insanity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
Your faith has atrophied  
And rots in hell's asylum  
Despondence tears you down  
A free-falling social strain  
Escape atrocity  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn to God's lies  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ
