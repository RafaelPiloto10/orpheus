I'll never feel again  
I'll never feel again  
Then I won't have to feel this pain  
I'm in if it sounds familiar  
  
Because nothing ever goes the way I've planned  
If it sounds peculiar  
Then you don't have to try and understand  
I'll never feel again  
  
I'll never feel again  
Then I won't have to feel this pain  
I'm in  
I'm not a great example of everything  
  
The world expects of us  
I know I'm no exception  
I've questioned everything  
I used to trust a question of necessity or lust  
  
I'll never feel again  
I'll never feel again t  
Hen I won't have to feel this pain  
I'm in it's as simple as you make it  
  
And as complicated as who you think you are
