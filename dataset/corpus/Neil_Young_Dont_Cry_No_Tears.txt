Don't cry no tears around me  
Don't cry no tears around me  
'Cause when all the water's gone  
The feeling lingers on  
Old true love  
Ain't too hard to see  
Don't cry no tears around me.  
  
Well I wonder  
Who's with her tonight?  
And I wonder  
Who's holding her tight?  
But there's nothing I can say  
To make him go away  
Old true love  
Ain't too hard to see  
Don't cry no tears around me.  
  
There's nothing I can say  
To make him go away  
Old true love  
Ain't too hard to see  
Don't cry no tears around me  
Don't cry no tears around me.
