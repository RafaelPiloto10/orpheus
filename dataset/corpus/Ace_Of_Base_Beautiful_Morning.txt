What a beautiful morning  
The best in life is free  
  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a mystery  
Though the world's on fire  
Yesterday's hard words is still in my head  
I feel no despair  
No regrets or sorrows  
Cause this new day  
Makes me dance on air  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
The shadows fading out  
  
As the day grows bright  
We are turning pages  
And we write new chapters of our life  
Some are strong and long  
Others weak with sorrows  
Keep the focus on the rising sun  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
Shadows fading out  
  
Believe me crows will always fly  
Believe me they are only birds  
You have to  
You have to let go and you will see things in a different light  
  
What a beautiful morning  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a beautiful  
What a beautiful morning  
  
Believe me
