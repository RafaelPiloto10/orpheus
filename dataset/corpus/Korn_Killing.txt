Birds are circling above  
They've come back to a waiting level  
Why don't they fly away?  
  
Surely they have gangs by now  
There is no gun to shoot them down  
And still they stay  
For what they say  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be killing them with lies  
I'll be fighting for my life  
Killing them with thoughts  
They can never get enough  
Killing them all because we're killing every single thing  
It's a trained response  
  
Birds are circling above  
They've come back to a waiting level  
Sold the game  
It bears my name  
  
I have worshiped some false Gods  
And run to them like I have not thought to  
Cry my shame  
It burned a flame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We are present to raise them to die  
To die  
We are present to raise them to die  
We are present to raise them to die  
  
Somebody told me once  
Beat them until there's nothing  
Get used to it  
Next thing the line is gone  
  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going?
