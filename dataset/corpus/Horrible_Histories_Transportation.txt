[Intro]  
With imagination  
Inspiration  
Innovation  
And perspiration  
We revolutionised transportation  
  
[Verse 1]  
Stephenson's the name and my steam engine's the best you will find  
(It was the Rocket, it was called the Rocket)  
It pulled a train that carried passengers and was the first of its kind  
(Caused a commotion, doing the locomotion)  
Was best by miles  
And won top prize  
At the Rainhill Trials  
  
[Verse 2]  
The Lords said it was dangerous then saw how many tickets could sell  
(The toffs were off it, til they saw a profit)  
  
[Verse 3]  
And so he paved the way for me I'm Isambard Kingdom Brunel  
(An engineer, and famous pioneer)  
Railways off pat  
A massive hat  
And to top that  
  
[Verse 4]  
I was a tunnel building  
Bridge creating  
Hard grafting  
Ship crafting  
Polymath in search of a way  
To take my train through my tunnel, cross my bridge to my ship  
And sail me fastest to the usa  
My steam ship, it made the trip  
In just fourteen days  
  
[Verse 5]  
There across the ocean was clever old me I'm quite a star  
(He's Henry Ford, yes that's what he's called)  
My assembly lines the first to make it cheap to buy a motor car  
(From Henry Ford, cars you can afford)  
I think you'll find  
Made just one kind  
But never mind  
  
[Verse 6]  
I was the fastest rating  
Car creating  
Introducing mass producing  
Original Model T guy  
  
[Verse 7]  
We took an engine, a bird wing  
Some bike skills, worked until we found out how machines did fly  
Not just a hop  
But non-stop  
Gonna get high, high, high!  
  
[Verse 8]  
I'm Orville, was the brains  
The brawn, my brother Wilbur Wright  
We refined the plane and made the first sustained flight  
Our engine small  
But powerful  
Propelled to a great height!  
  
[Verse 9]  
They were supreme  
Our mean machines  
The stuff of dreams  
  
[Verse 10]  
We were creative, inventive  
Progress our incentive  
Always searching for a solution  
We took some steel and a wheel  
Made a plane, car and train and created a revolution  
  
[Verse 11]  
Hard to believe what we achieved  
Looking back, we helped change tack  
Transport was duller, we added colour  
Well, as long as it's black
