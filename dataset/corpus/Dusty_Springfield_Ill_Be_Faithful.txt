I would be your water when your thirsty mouth was dry  
I would be your sunshine when clouds are in the sky  
I would stand that close beside you  
And be your only friend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true, too  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, yes I will now  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you  
  
Now I would be your music if you would like a song  
I would sleep beside you when the winter's cold and long  
I would be the pole to guide you, never would I bend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true too, mmm  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you, ooh, hoo  
  
I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true, too  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, yes I will  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you
