Watching every motion  
In my foolish lover's game  
On this endless ocean  
Finally lover's know no shame  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn around and say  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Watching, I keep waiting  
Still anticipating love  
Never hesitating  
To become the fated ones  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn to me and say  
My love...  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Through the hourglass I saw you  
In time you slipped away  
When the mirror crashed I called you  
And turned to hear you say  
If only for today  
I am unafraid  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Watching every motion  
In this foolish lover's game  
Haunted by a notion  
Somewhere there's a love in this place  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn away and say  
  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away
