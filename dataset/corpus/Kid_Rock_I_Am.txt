Hey dude, you recordin'  
  
Well fire it up, chop one out, somebody's got to know  
That I'm two days in, I got two days left to go  
'Cause I am Georgia, I am Memphis, Tennessee  
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be  
I am love and I am hate, I'm your late night drunk debate  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
  
Have you ever seen the sun over the rocky mountains shinin'  
Or touched the sands of a southern Florida beach  
Have you seen a grown man cry or a child that's slowly dying  
Have you looked inside to see all that you can see  
  
And I am North and South Dakota, and New York City  
I am everything Hollywood wants to be  
I am love and I am hate, and the critics can all debate  
But they'll never put a finger on me  
No you'll never put your finger on  
  
Ohh, ohh, hey, hey  
Ohh, ohh, yeah, eh, yeah, eh, hey, hey  
  
Have you seen the Northern falls or the midwest seasons changing  
A Montana storm, or warm Kentucky rain  
Have you heard the love that sings over inner city sidewalks  
Have you risen above all that leads to hate  
  
And I am Boston and D.C., and all of Detroit city  
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be  
I am Southern rock n roll, country and hip-hop and soul  
And you'll never put your finger on me  
  
I'm a father and I'm a friend, I'm your brother until the end  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
I am "Only God Knows Why", I'll be a "Cowboy" till I die  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
  
You'll never put your finger on me, you'll never put it on, put it on, on me  
You'll never put, never put it on, put it, put it on, hey, never put it on  
You'll never put, never, never, never, never, never, never  
Put your finger on me
