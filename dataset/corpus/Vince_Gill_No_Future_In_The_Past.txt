I lie here tonight in the darkness  
I've never felt so alone  
tomorrow I'll wake up still lonesome  
'Cause things haven't changed since you've gone  
  
You walked out with angry words spoken  
You're leavin' cut right to the bone  
I'll pick up the pieces you have broken  
Find the strength to go on  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why can't I forget it  
Why can't I admit it  
There ain't no future in the past  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why can't I forget it  
Why can't I admit it  
There ain't no future in the past
