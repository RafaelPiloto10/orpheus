Everyone I see these days still asks me about you  
I guess they got so used to us together they assume  
That everything's ok and then I have to say  
  
I wouldn't know I haven't seen him  
I couldn't say it's been awhile  
I haven't thought about him lately  
So I wouldn't know  
I'm getting tired of people askin'  
Why can't they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know  
  
I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds  
Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why you're not around  
Well I just stay away, so I don't have to say  
  
I wouldn't know I haven't seen him  
I couldn't say it's been awhile  
I haven't thought about him lately  
So I wouldn't know  
I'm getting tired of people askin'  
Why can't they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know
