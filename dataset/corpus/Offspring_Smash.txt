Head over heals I've fit in before  
Now I don't want to do it no more  
I've held it all in with blood on my face  
Built it up man so bad you can taste  
  
I don't slag no one  
I don't even judge  
Don't give a shit cause I'm not gonna budge  
I just want to be who I want to be  
  
Guess that's hard for others to see  
I'm not a trendy asshole  
I do what I want  
I do what I feel like  
  
I'm not a trendy asshole  
I don't fuck if it's good enough for you  
'Cause I'm alive  
Smash is the way you feel all alone  
  
Like an outcast you're out on your own  
Smash is the way you deal with your life  
Like an outcast you're smashing your strife  
Head over heals I've fit in before  
  
Now I don't want to do it no more  
I just want to be who I want to be  
Guess that's hard for others to see
