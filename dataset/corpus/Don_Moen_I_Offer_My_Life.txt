All that I am, all that I have  
I lay them down before You, oh Lord  
All my regrets, all my acclaims  
The joy and the pain, I'm making them Yours  
  
Lord, I offer my life to You  
Everything I've been through, use it for Your glory  
Lord I offer my days to You  
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice  
Lord I offer You my life  
  
Things in the past, things yet unseen  
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true  
All of my heart, all of my praise  
My heart and my hands are lifted to You  
  
Lord, I offer my life to You  
Everything I've been through, use it for Your glory  
Lord I offer my days to You  
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice  
Lord I offer You my life  
  
What can we give that You have not given?  
And what do we have that is not already Yours?  
All we possess are these lives we're living  
That's what we give to You, Lord  
  
Lord, I offer my life to You  
Everything I've been through, use it for Your glory  
Lord I offer my days to You  
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice  
Lord I offer You my life  
  
Lord, I offer my life to You  
Everything I've been through, use it for Your glory  
Lord I offer my days to You  
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice  
Lord I offer You my life  
Lord I offer You my life
