Praise You till the morning sun shines upon my eyes  
Praise You till the moon begins to shine  
I lift You up above my heart  
I'm Yours right from the start  
I lift my simple songs for Your delight  
  
Here I am to praise You  
Here I am to worship You  
Let me sing this song for You  
  
Chorus:  
You are my glorious  
My glorious risen Lord  
You are most wonderfull  
Coz no one to compare  
With You Lord...
