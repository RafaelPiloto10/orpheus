I have a very good friend in Nashville Tennessee  
Who is a semiprofessional wino  
And during one of our recent and frequent conversations  
We got to talk about his religious philosophy  
And as far as I could determine this is the way he feels about it  
Lord can a drunk go to heaven  
Well, frankly I don't see why not  
If the Lord loves the weak and the weary  
Well, how come He can't love a sot  
Now I don't drink to hurt anybody  
Why I love everybody I meet  
I can quit any time but I don't want to  
And in fact I quit three times last week  
Now lemme tell you 'bout some of them preachers  
Lord you know some of 'em ain't worth a dime  
Why they're flirtin' with all of them wider, mm yeah  
And one is a wider of mine  
Oh, I hear people prayin' so fancy  
Why they'd be better off a sendin' you mail  
Lord if they could've heard me last Sunday  
Well, I've prayed 'em right out of that jail  
Now Lord if a drunk gets to heaven  
To walk on that great Golden Strand  
Would You give me a spot and the shade of a tree  
And remember I'm a bourbon man
