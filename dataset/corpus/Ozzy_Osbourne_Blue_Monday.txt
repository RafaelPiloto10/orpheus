How does it feel  
To treat me like you do  
When you layed your hands upon me  
And told me who you are  
  
I thought I was mistaken  
I thought I heard your words  
But tell me how I feel  
Tell me know how do I feel.  
  
How does it feel  
How should I feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
To treat me like you do  
  
Those who came before me  
Lived through thier vacations  
From the past until completion  
They will turn away no more  
  
I still find it so hard  
To say what I need to say  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me  
Just how I should feel today  
  
I see a ship in the harbor  
I can and shall obey  
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes  
I'd be a heavenly person to day  
  
I thought I was mistaken  
I thought I heard you speak  
Tell me how do I feel  
Tell me know how should I feel  
  
Now I stand here waiting  
  
I thought I told you to leave me  
When I walked down to the beach  
Tell me how does it feel  
When your heart grows cold  
  
How does it feel  
How should I feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
To treat me like you do
