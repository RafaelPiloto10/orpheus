He likes Vampires and hitless radio  
Turns it off when he hears this one song he knows  
And you breathe, the window's down  
You're driving awkward as you make your way back home  
  
You ride in silence because he will not let go  
And you breathe, the window's down  
It's a new place that you have found  
  
I've been up late writing books  
All about heroes and crooks  
One of them saves you from this  
The other one steals you and then  
Sure things fall  
And all sure things fall  
  
Do you remember how we used to get so high?  
It didn't work at first, we tried it two more times  
And we could breathe, the window's down  
I was thinking of the temperature outside  
  
Cool like the water that was running through our eyes  
And you breathe, the window's down  
It's a new place that we have found  
  
I've been up late writing books  
All about heroes and crooks  
One of them saves you from this  
The other one steals you and then  
Sure things fall  
And all sure things fall  
  
He could take you all the way to Church this time,  
But don't forget you summed it up in 15 lies  
  
I've been up late writing books  
All about heroes and crooks  
One of them saves you from this  
The other one steals you  
  
Of all of the places I looked  
And all of the pictures I took  
One of them's here with me now  
I'm finally finding out how  
  
Sure things fall  
All sure things fall
