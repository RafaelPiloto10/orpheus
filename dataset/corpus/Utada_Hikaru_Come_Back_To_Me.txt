The rain falls on my windows  
And the coldness runs through my soul  
And the rain falls, oh the rain falls  
I don't want to be alone  
I wish that I could Photoshop  
All our bad memories  
Cause the flashbacks, oh the flashbacks  
Won't leave me alone  
  
If you come back to me  
I'll be all that you need  
Baby come back to me  
Let me make up for what happened in the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
You're one in a million (One in a million)  
  
Lower East Side of Manhattan  
She goes shopping for new clothes  
And she buys this and she buys that  
Just leave her alone  
I wish that he would listen to her side of the story  
It isn't that bad, it isn't that bad  
And she's wiser for it now  
  
I admit I cheated  
Don't know why I did it  
But I do regret it  
Nothing I can do or say can change the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
You're one in a million (One in a million)  
  
Everything I ever did  
Heaven knows I'm sorry babe  
I was too young to see  
You were always there for me  
And my curiosity got the better of me  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Anything from A to Z  
Call me what you wanna babe  
I open my heart to thee  
You are my priority  
Can't you see you've punished me  
More than enough already  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
You're one in a million (One in a million)  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
You're one in a million (One in a million)
