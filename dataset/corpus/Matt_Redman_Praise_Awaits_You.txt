Praise awaits You in this place today, O Lord  
We are gathered, ready, God, to sing Your praise  
Ready to respond to the glories of Your name  
To the wonders of Your heart  
To Your great love  
Chorus:  
Praise is waiting for You in this place  
There's a cry that our spirits will make  
As we see Your glory  
To your mercies our souls will awake  
And we'll sing 'til the break of the day  
Because You are worthy  
Yes Lord!  
Seasons come and seasons go but You remain  
So unchanging, all-deserving of our praise  
We're ready to respond to the glories of Your name  
To the wonders of Your heart  
To Your great love  
We're ready to respond  
To the glories of your name  
To the wonders of Your heart  
To Your great love
