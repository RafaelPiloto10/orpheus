I was just a lonely girl  
Looking for a little fun  
Though without a friend in the world  
I was forced to find a new one  
  
Now I'm the queen of Mars,  
I was invisible on Earth  
It only took the magic portal to Mars  
To give me some self worth  
  
You put a crown on my head,  
And you all seem to worship me  
But you don't understand a word I say  
Still you treat me like royalty  
  
'Cause I'm the queen of Mars  
I was invisible on Earth  
It only took the magic portal to Mars  
To give me some self worth
