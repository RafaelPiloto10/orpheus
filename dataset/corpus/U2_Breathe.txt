16th of June, nine-oh-five, door bell rings  
Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer  
There's a few things I need you to know  
Three  
  
Coming from a long line of  
Traveling sales people on my mother's side  
I wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatoo  
So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home  
Would you  
  
These days are better than that  
These days are better than that  
  
Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn  
Every day I have to find the courage  
To walk out into the street  
With arms out  
Got a love you can't defeat  
Neither down nor out  
There's nothing you have that I need  
I can breathe  
Breathe now  
  
16th of June, Chinese stocks are going up  
And I'm coming down with some new Asian virus  
Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man  
Doc says you're fine, or dying  
Please  
Nine-oh-nine, St. John Divine on the line, my pulse is fine  
But I'm running down the road like loose electricity  
While the band in my head plays a striptease  
  
The roar that lies on the other side of silence  
The forest fire that is fear so deny it  
  
Walk out into the street  
Sing your heart out  
The people we meet  
Will not be drowned out  
There's nothing you have that I need  
I can breathe  
Breathe now  
Yeah, yeah  
  
We are people borne of sound  
The songs are in our eyes  
Gonna wear them like a crown  
  
Walk out, into the sunburst street  
Sing your heart out, sing my heart out  
I've found grace inside a sound  
I found grace, it's all that I found  
And I can breathe  
Breathe now
