In my hour of need  
Ha, you're not there  
And though I reach out for you  
Wouldn't lend a hand  
Through the darkest hour  
Grace did not shine on me  
It feels so cold, very cold  
No one cares for me  
Did you ever think I get lonely?  
Did you ever think that I needed love?  
Did you ever think to stop thinking  
You're the only one that I'm thinking of?  
You'll never know how hard I tried  
To find my space and satisfy you too.  
Things will be better when I'm dead and gone  
Don't try to understand  
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong  
But oh, how I lived my life for you  
Still you'd turn away  
Now as I die for you  
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name  
All there years I thought I was wrong  
Now I know it was you  
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes  
Tell me who you think you are, who?  
I walk, I walk alone into the promised land.  
There's a better place for me  
But it's far, far away  
Everlasting life for me in a perfect world  
But I gotta die first,  
Please God send me on my way  
Time has a way of taking time  
Loneliness is not only felt by fools  
Alone I call to ease the pain  
Yearning to be held by you  
Alone, so alone, I'm lost, consumed by the pain  
The pain, the pain, the pain  
Won't you hold me again?  
You just laughed, ha ha, bitch!  
My whole life is work built on the past  
But the time has come when all things shall pass  
The good has passed away.  
In my darkest hour
