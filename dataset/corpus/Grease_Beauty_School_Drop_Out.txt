Your story's sad to tell, a teenage ne'er-do-well  
Most mixed up non-delinquent on the block  
Your future's so unclear now, what's left of your career now  
Can't even get a trade-in on your smile  
  
Beauty school drop-out, no graduation day for you  
Beauty school drop-out, missed your midterms and flunked shampoo  
Well at least you could have taken time to wash and clean your clothes up  
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fix your nose up  
  
Baby get moving (better get moving), why keep your feeble hopes alive  
What are you proving (what are you proving)?  
You've got the dream, but not the drive  
If you go for your diploma, you could join a steno pool  
Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to highschool  
  
Beauty school drop-out, hangin' around the corner store  
Beauty school drop-out, it's about time you knew the score  
Well they couldn't teach you anything, you think you're such a looker  
But no customer would go to you, unless she was a hooker  
  
Baby don't sweat it (don't sweat it), you're not cut out to hold the job  
Better forget it (forget it), who wants their hair done by a slob  
Now your bangs are curled, your lashes twirled, and still the world iscruel  
Wipe off that angel face and go back to highschool  
  
Baby don't blow it, don't put my good advice to shame  
Baby you know it, even Dear Abby's say the same  
Now I've called the shot, get off the pot, I really gotta fly  
Gotta be goin' to that maltshop in the sky  
  
Beauty school drop-out, go back to highschool  
Beauty school drop-out, go back to highschool  
Beauty school drop-out, go back to highschool
