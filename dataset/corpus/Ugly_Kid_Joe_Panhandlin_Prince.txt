Sittin' on a rusty park bench baby  
Not much else to do  
Smoke cigarettes and rink my Mickey's  
Fine malt liquor brew  
As I start drinkin' and I start thinkin'  
That death is on my side  
If my heart stopped beatin', the street kept reekin'  
That's suicide, that's right!  
  
I grew up in the inner city  
A dark part of this town  
Just another innocent backwoods victim  
Society like to put down  
You can call me a boozer, or call me a loser  
It really doesn't matter to me  
I got a bench for snoozin', some sauce to keep boozin'  
That's all I neeed  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep it comin', sometimes I don't know why  
I'm gonna do it 'til the day i die  
  
Consider me the duke as I dine in your dumpster  
Unsanitary engineer  
Baron of the bench the panhandlin' master  
Well, I'm pullin' twenty G's a year  
I know it ain't much but at least I'm in touch, yeah  
With reality  
And I wouldn't trade no places to be in rat races  
No siree!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, Mr. Trump, can I ask you a question  
You got some spare change for me sucker?  
'Cause I'm down and out and there ain't no doubt  
That I am here to stay  
  
Yeah you see me lyin' with my brothers  
In the gutter with my paper bag in hand  
Yeah the streets are cold but at least  
There's soul and that's all I need!  
  
You'll take away my peace of mind  
You'll leave me there to rot and die  
But look again, my careless friend  
The world you live is just a lie  
It's a give and take, the more the fake  
The more the pain, the more you lose  
Live your life, don't take no sides  
N'seize the day and drink your booze!
