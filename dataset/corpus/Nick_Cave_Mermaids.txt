She was a catch,  
We were a match  
I was the match that would fire up her snatch  
There was a catch  
I was no match  
I was fired from her crutch  
Now I sit around and watch  
The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks  
They are beyond our touch  
I watch and watch  
Wave at me  
They wave at me  
They wave and slip  
Back into the sea  
  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the sea  
  
I believe in God  
I believe in mermaids too  
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain (why not, why not)  
I believe in the rapture  
For I've seen your face  
On the floor of the ocean  
At the bottom of the ray  
  
I do drive a relentless course  
I do husband alertness course  
I do mermaid alertness course  
Watch them out on the rocks  
Wave at me  
Wave at me  
They wave and slip  
Back into the sea  
  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the sea  
  
For all the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the sea
