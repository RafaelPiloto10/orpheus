Why don't you come over?  
It's lonely at the wooden lodge  
Why don't you come and see our baby?  
You haven't seen her for so long  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
  
There in the back woods  
We had our little piece of land  
But everything wasn't so groovy  
Not when you had to dirty your hands  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
  
It's lonely at the wooden lodge  
So why don't you share my bed  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me
