Well, I want to go out without tearing my bed, now  
I's so scared my baby quit and  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
And lose that girl of mine  
  
Well, she spend my money - buying me clothes  
She's done cheapest woman I ever did know and  
So, I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
And lose that girl of mine  
Yeah  
  
Break:  
I got a good friend from Alabama  
He tried to steal my chick, I don't know how many times  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it, ah  
I can't afford to do it  
And lose that girl of mine, ah  
  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
I can't afford to do it  
And lose that girl of mine, um
