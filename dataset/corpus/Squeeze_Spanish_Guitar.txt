Talking to demons that fly through the room  
When I'm home late and she's gone out of tune  
No more excuses, I'm being locked out  
The key to her heart will never be found  
I can't get close to the one that I love  
I try to reason but that's not enough  
It was all right then, love was there in a friend  
Cold nights on sofas, the birds sing all night  
Their song my story which sums up my life  
The life I'm losing, the love I'll regret  
No sheets, no pillows to make up by bed  
Upon the toilet I think very hard  
Love's in the tune of my Spanish guitar  
And we're together now, harmony's been found  
And the Spanish guitar can play  
Strum, strum, strumming away  
She's the guitar that went out of tune  
But now she's in love with you  
In love with you, in love with you
