Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine  
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming  
Get out the way, get out the way  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine  
Line up a long shot maybe try it two times, maybe more  
Good to know you got shoes to wear, when you find the floor  
Why hold out for more  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine  
Asking you nice, now, keep the mother rollin'  
One more time, been down before  
You just don't have to go no more, no more  
Here comes sunshine  
Here comes sunshine
