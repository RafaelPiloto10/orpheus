Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks  
And have 'em on the line.  
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts  
'fore you can count from one to nine.  
I can slip up a great big dip up of lard  
From a drippings can.  
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping,  
And be back before it melts in the pan.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
Let me tell ya again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well I can rub and scrub  
'til this house shines just like a dime.  
Feed the baby, grease the car,  
Powder my nose at the same time.  
You know I can get all dressed up,  
Go out swinging with the M-A-N,  
Jump in bed at five, sleep 'til 6,  
And start all over again.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
Let me tell ya again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well now if you come to me sick,  
You know that I'm gonna make you well.  
And if you come to me all hexed up,  
You know I'm gonna break the spell.  
And if you come to me hungry,  
You know I'll feed ya full of my grits.  
And if it's loving you want,  
I can kiss you and give you the shivering fits.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
I'll say it again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well, I got a twenty dollar gold fee  
That says there's nothing that I can't do.  
Well, I can make a dress out of feeding sacks,  
And I can make a man out Of you.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
I'll say it again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
I'm a woman.  
I'm a woman.  
I'm a woman.  
Yeah, I'm a woman.
