Here I write you dear  
Seems our love had to run  
And how I wish you here  
'Cause lady you are  
Oh maybe you are the one  
I know, here I'am alone  
Guess we kids had our fun  
And I hear you've grown  
To the lady you are  
Oh maybe you are the one  
I realize that I'm just a boy who believes in what he feels  
And my dreams have all been changed by what is real  
Will you write me dear  
Only now as best friends  
I'll always wish, I'll always widh you here  
Oh then lady for me  
Say you'll begin again my love
