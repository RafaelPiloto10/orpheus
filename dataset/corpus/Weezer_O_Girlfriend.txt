I miss you  
And I wonder how you feel about me too  
Do you miss the way we were  
And how we used to be  
Suddenly  
We're apart and I can't see you everynight  
Do miss the way we loved  
And I can't feel your touch  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost without your love,  
Oh love.  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
For you love  
'Cause I'm drifting further from you every day  
Driving by your place every night  
I used to feel all right  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost without your love  
Oh love  
  
Feeling ancy every night  
When I dream to be all right  
Oh love  
Oh love  
  
Ooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost with out your love  
Oh love  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la..  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la....  
Now I just want to shout
