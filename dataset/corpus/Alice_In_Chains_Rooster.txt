Ain't found a way to kill me yet  
Eyes burn with stinging sweat  
Seems every path leads me to nowhere  
Wife and kids household pet  
Army green was no safe bet  
The bullets scream to me from somewhere  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Here they come to snuff the rooster, aww yeah, hey yeah  
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah  
You know he ain't gonna die  
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die  
  
Walkin' tall machine gun man  
They spit on me in my home land  
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy  
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death  
My Buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath  
Oh god please won't you help me make it through  
  
Here they come to snuff the rooster, aww yeah  
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah  
You know he ain't gonna die  
No, no, no ya know he ain't gonna die
