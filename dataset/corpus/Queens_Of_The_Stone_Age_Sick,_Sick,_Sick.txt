Young, dumb, don't see a problem  
Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum  
Simple as this: I'm in love with the risk  
I know what I've done, but tell me, what did I miss?  
So please, don't save something, waste not, save nothing  
Lose the halo, don't need to resist  
A lick of the lips and a grip on your hips  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
  
First thing we succumb to  
Shout, erase, and undo  
Days are unreleased if there's no release  
Please just let me do whatever fits you  
Make something, make someone  
Beg on a knee, baby, baby, please  
Pout your bottom lip  
While cracking the whip  
You know what we want  
It's candy to cum to  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
  
A total eclipse in the teeth of the risk  
The tongue is a twist  
Perpetual bliss  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever...  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)  
  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
