Things are not always what they appear to be  
Beneath the calm exterior  
There can be a soul on fire  
  
Truth is not always what the eyes can see  
The smile upon our faces  
Can disguise our pain and hide the traces  
  
Sometimes the rock that we depend on  
Melts into the ground and disappears  
The one thing you thought was forever  
Slowly washed away by all the tears  
  
If I gotta be true to no other  
I gotta be true to myself  
  
Raise up your head now so the world can see  
You have the inner vision  
Though the fight is far from over  
  
You've got to battle with it endlessly  
Before life becomes a rumor  
A sudden risin' tide that pulls you under  
  
Sometimes the rock that we depend on  
Melts into the ground and disappears  
The one thing you thought was forever  
Slowly washed away by all the tears  
  
If I gotta be true to no other  
I gotta be true to myself  
  
(True to myself)  
(True to myself)  
  
If I'm gonna make it come tomorrow  
(True to myself)  
Hallowed be the voice of constant sorrow  
(True to myself)  
Gotta climb the ladder if I'm able  
(True to myself)  
I can't keep this shining light under the table, my love  
(True to myself)  
I wanna be, I gotta be true to myself, hey, hey'  
(True to myself)
