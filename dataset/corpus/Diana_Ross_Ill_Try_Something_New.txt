I will build you a castle with a tower so high  
Till it reaches the moon  
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly  
And compose you a tune  
  
Give you lovin' as warm  
As Mama's oven  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
  
I will take you away with me as far as I can  
To Venus or Mars  
There we will love with your hand in my hand  
You'll be king of the stars  
  
Everyday we can play  
On the Milky Way  
And if that don't do  
I'll have to try something new  
  
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea  
To wear in your hair, thank you  
I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy boy  
To show you that I care  
  
I'll pretend I'm jealous  
Of all the fellas  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new
