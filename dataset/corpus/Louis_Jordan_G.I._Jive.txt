This is the G. I. Jive  
Man alive  
It starts with the bugler blowin' reveille over your bed when you arrive  
Jack, that's the G. I. Jive  
Roodley-toot  
Jump in your suit  
Make a salute  
Voot  
  
After you wash and dress  
More or less  
You go get your breakfast in a beautiful little caf?they call "The Mess"  
Jack, when you convalesce  
Outta your seat  
Into the street  
Make with the feet  
Reet  
  
If you're a P-V-T, your duty  
Is to salute to L-I-E-you-T  
But if you brush the L-I-E-you-T  
The M-P makes you K-P on the Q-T  
This is the G. I. Jive  
Man alive  
They give you a private tank that features a little device called "fluid
drive"  
Jack, after you revive  
Chuck all your junk  
Back in the trunk  
Fall on your bunk  
Clunk  
  
This is the G. I. Jive  
Man alive  
They give you a private tank that features a little device called "fluid
drive"  
Jack, if you still survive  
Chuck all your junk  
Back in the trunk  
Fall on your bunk  
Clunk  
  
Soon you're countin' jeeps  
But before you count to five  
Seems you're right back diggin' that G. I. Jive
