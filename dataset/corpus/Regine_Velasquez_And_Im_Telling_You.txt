And I am telling you, I'm not going  
You're the best man I'll never know  
There's no way I can ever go  
No no no no way, no no no no way I'm living without you  
I'm not living without you  
I don't wanna be free  
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'  
And you, and you, you're gonna love me, ahh, ahh, ahh  
You're gonna love me.  
And I am telling you I'm not going  
Even though the rough times are showin'  
There's just, there's no way, there's no way  
We're part of the same place  
We're part of the same time  
We both share the same blood  
We both have the same mind  
And time, and time we've had so much to share  
No no no no no no, I'm not waking up tomorrow morning, ha, ha  
And fight that is, nobody else  
Darling there's no way, no no no way  
I'm not living without you,  
I'm not living without you  
You see there's just, there's no way, there's no way  
Tear down the mountains, yell ,scream and shout  
You can what you want, I'm not walkin' out  
Stop all the rivers, push, strike, and kill  
I'm not gonna leave you, there's no way I will  
And I am telling you I'm not going  
You're the best man I'll ever know  
There's no way I can ever, ever go  
No no no no way, no no no no way I'm living without you, ooh  
I'm not living without you, not living without you  
I don't wanna be free  
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'  
And you, and you, and you, you're gonna love me  
Ooh...yeah...ooh...yeah  
Love me, love me, love me, love me  
You're gonna love ... me
