Brother Seems they're letting him out next year  
He's behaving himself, I hear  
Governor Conway says it will be fine  
Just as long as he can tow the line  
  
It's the same old story  
But it says here "Mum you're not to worry"  
'Cos some you lose and some you lose  
  
At this party, he was on his own  
All he did was say he'd take her home  
But it seems they didn't go straight there  
'cos on the porch, she told him,  
"put your hand here"  
  
Yes it's that same old story  
They told her mum she's not to worry  
  
Police "If what she says is so,  
we'll never let him go!"  
  
Him "Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again, telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door"  
Brother And now that you've paid for those lies  
Get another disguise  
  
"It's twenty years now since our Kid came free  
Oh I remember August '53  
But it wasn't quite like they said  
With that behind you, you can't plan ahead  
Yes it's the same old story  
They say you're free, but don't worry  
What they said's not so  
They'll never let you go!"  
  
Him "Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again, telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door"  
Brother And now that you've paid for those lies  
Get another disguise
