Our love is gone and you're left alone  
What can you do when love's lost sight of you?  
  
Ooh, la, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la, la  
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play  
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay  
I'm crying ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
  
Sorry, let me come home and love you  
Though it's hard, though it's hard to do  
What can I do?  
  
Mistakes, I know I've made a few  
But I'm only human, you've made mistakes too  
I'm crying ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby I love you  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby I need you  
Ooh baby, baby, baby tell me what do I do?  
Ooh baby, baby, baby let me make it up to you  
  
Baby, baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Baby, baby I can't hold on much longer  
Baby, baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
  
Ooh stronger, my heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
Ooh stronger, the heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
  
I'm just about at the end of my rope  
But I can't stop trying, I can't give up hope  
'Cause I feel I'll be here, someday I'll hold you near  
Whisper I still love you until that day is here, until that day is  
  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, ooh
