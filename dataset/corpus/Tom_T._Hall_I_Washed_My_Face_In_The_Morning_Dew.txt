The first strange town I was ever in  
The county was hangin' a man  
Nobody cared if he lived or died  
And I just didn't understand  
  
So I washed my face in the morning dew  
Bathed my soul in the sun  
Washed my face in the morning dew  
And kept on movin' along  
  
The second strange town I was in  
They were laughing at a poor crippled man  
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street  
And I just didn't understand  
  
The third strange town that I was in  
Was settled, peaceful and nice  
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer  
And to me it just didn't seem right  
  
So I washed my face in the morning dew  
Bathed my soul in the sun  
Washed my face in the morning dew  
And kept on movin' along  
  
Some day things are bound to change  
It can't be very far  
And each injustice I have seen  
Will come before the bar  
  
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew  
Bathe my soul in the sun  
Wash my face in the morning dew  
And keep on movin' along
