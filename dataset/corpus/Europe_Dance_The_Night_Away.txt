Hey girl I can feel your heart  
We had something goin' on right from the start  
When I look at you I just feel so good  
Hear the music breakin' up the ground  
Can you feel it I just love the sound  
And I'm lettin' go just like I should  
There's something goin' on that's so hard to describe  
Well, I can dance the night away  
There's nothin' else that I want to do  
I can dance the night away  
There's no one else that I want but you  
Tomorrow never gets in my way  
When I feel like dancin' night and day  
I just want to get up and never ever get down  
Seems to me I won't get old  
And my heart will never ever get cold  
It's so hard to feel bad when you're around
