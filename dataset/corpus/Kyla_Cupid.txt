Boy if I told you I love you  
That doesn't mean that I don't care, oooh  
And when I tell you I need you  
Don't you think that I'll can never be there, ooooh  
  
Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
I'm only saying what's in my heart  
Cupid doesn't lie  
But you won't know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby, true love  
Won't lie but you won't know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Boy when I ask you to trust me  
That doesn't mean that I'm gonna cheat on you  
Cause I'm gonna never do anything to hurt you  
Or mislead you, I love you  
  
Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
I'm only saying what's in my heart  
Cupid doesn't lie  
But you won't know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby, true love  
Won't lie but you won't know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Lord no, I really mean it  
I rather die before I, before I lie to you  
Never wanna leave you  
Ain't no life without you  
Never gonna leave, never gonna go,  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh
