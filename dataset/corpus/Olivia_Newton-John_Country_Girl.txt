I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun  
The flowers were my pillow when the day's work was done  
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs  
The call of the city life kept going through my mind  
Oh yeah, the days of my childhood would soon be left behind  
  
It was a Saturday morning when the snow lay on the ground  
Pa said the time had come when I could move to town  
So I kissed goodbye to mama, held on tight to papa's hand  
I saw a tear in mama's eye but I did not understand  
'Cause I was just a country girl being brought up on the land  
  
Goodbye mama, let me see your smile  
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye  
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you  
But I'll be coming home again someday  
No, I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
A country girl, you know I'll always stay  
  
I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun  
The flowers were my pillow when the day's work was done  
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs  
Yet I know where I belong, I got my peace of mind  
Oh yeah, I was born a country girl and that just suits me fine  
  
Goodbye mama, let me see your smile  
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye  
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you  
But I'll be coming home again someday  
No, I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I'll come back to you, believe me  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
A country girl, you know I'll always stay
