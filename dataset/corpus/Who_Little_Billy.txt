Little Billy was the fattest kid in his class  
Always the last in line  
All the other little kids would laugh at him  
Said he'd die before his time  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy didn't mind  
  
Most of the kids smoked cigarettes  
Just to prove that they were cool  
The teacher didn't know about the children's games  
And Billy always followed the rules  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy didn't mind  
  
Billy was big on the outside  
But there's an even bigger man inside  
Ten million cigarettes burning every day  
And Billy's still doing fine  
  
Now Billy and his classmates are middle-aged  
With children of their own  
Their smoking games are reality now  
And cancer's seed is sown  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy's didn't mind  
  
Most of them smoke maybe forty a day  
A habit Billy doesn't share  
One by one they're passing away  
Leaving orphans to Billy's care  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy doesn't mind  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha  
Little Billy's doing fine
