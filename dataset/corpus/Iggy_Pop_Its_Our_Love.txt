I found you looking for the rainbow  
You found me waiting for a chance  
Now we got something good together  
A life where we have joined our hands  
And there ain't nobody gonna break that  
Our love  
And there ain't nobody gonna break it  
Our love  
Our love  
  
I didn't have too much to offer  
You didn t have much to expect  
A cold hotel room full of trouble  
Beside a blinking traffic light  
On all night  
And there ain't nobody gonna break this  
It' s our love  
There ain't nobody gonna take it  
Not our love  
Nobody's gonna take this  
It 's our love  
Love  
  
I know the feeling of being outside  
Alone and watching all the fun  
The crowd's together, laughing loudly  
And long  
But that type, they re never really strong  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
There ain't nobody who's gonna break it  
It's our love
