When I'm on the road playin' in a town without a name  
And I'm feelin' low everybody looks the same  
Well, you catch my eye and then you come on strong  
An' try to make your play  
Just because we love tonight  
Please, don't you think it's gonna stay that way  
  
Don't you know that you're nothin' more than a one night stand?  
Tomorrow I'll be on my way, baby, catch me if you can  
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again  
  
Everywhere I go, the people try to get next to me  
That's alright but tomorrow I've got to be free  
We've got good a thing, baby, and it's all up on us tonight  
Don't you go and spoil it dear, by trying to get yourself all uptight  
  
Don't you know that you're nothin' more than a one night stand?  
Tomorrow I'll be on my way, baby, catch me if you can  
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again
