I've been watching you, watching me  
Can't you tell what I'm going through?  
I wanna hold your fire, wanna get you higher  
Think of the things we'll do  
You put it out there, then you take it back  
You treat me like I'm your toy  
You know exactly what you're doing, just another heart in ruin  
But I just wanna be your boy  
  
It's evil, when something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright, it's in my blood and it feels like it should  
  
Start to feel the rush of the thoughtful time  
Moonlight's kicking in the door  
Stay awake and keep it roar  
Go all night and got before, you're beautiful  
  
I'm gonna take you on a drive around Central Park  
Buy you some real good french wine  
I'll treat you like a queen, you got a spell on me  
It's a voodoo kind of thing  
  
It's evil, when something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright, it's in my blood and it feels like it should  
  
She's so evil, way she walks into the room  
And I may not leave here alive  
And the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil  
  
Don't you know it's evil  
When something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright  
It's in my blood and it feels like it should  
It's evil  
When something so bad makes you feel this good  
It's in my blood
