I burn with desire  
each time my heart fans the fire  
To that old flame  
that burns inside of me  
She cried when I left her  
now I try to forget her  
Oh how foolish I was  
to ever want to leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Because nobody in his right mind  
would've left her  
I had to be crazy to say good bye  
Nobody in his right mind  
could've left her  
Even my heart was smart enough  
to stay behind  
  
I still carry her picture  
I wish her well  
with the new love  
I know she's found by now  
Each night finds me dreamin'  
each day I spend thinkin'  
How much I wish  
she was still around  
  
[Chorus]
