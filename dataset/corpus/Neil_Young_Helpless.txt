There is a town in North Ontario  
Dream comfort mem'ry to spare  
And in my mind I still need a place to go  
All my changes were there  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
Big birds flying across the sky  
Throwing shadows on our eyes  
  
Leave us  
  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Babe, can you hear me now?  
The chains are locked and tied across the door  
Baby, sing with me somehow  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
Big birds flying across the sky  
Throwing shadows on our eyes  
  
Leave us  
  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
