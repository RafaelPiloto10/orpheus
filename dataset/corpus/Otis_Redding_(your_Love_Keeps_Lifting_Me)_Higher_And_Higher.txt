Your love keeps lifting me higher

So give me love  
Which is my desire, honey  
I'm gonna be at your side  
Forever more

Keeps lifting me higher  
Than I ever been lifted before  
So give me love, oh

Now, once down and broken hearted  
And disappointment was my closest friend  
And than you, you came and heated hearted  
And you know he never showed his face again

Than I ever been lifted before  
So give me love, oh  
Which is my desire
