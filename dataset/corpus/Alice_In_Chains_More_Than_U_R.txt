The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But then I realized in the end  
You were nothin but a cheat  
  
Bridge:  
You took my heart  
And broke it  
I took it back  
And sewed it...  
  
Chorus:  
Cause I am, more than you are  
You showed me life  
And I shoved it back in ur fucking face  
I hate the way that you live ur life  
But oh well, I'm not apart of it, anymore  
  
Maybe, if you wouldn't have done this  
We'd still be complete  
But who cares, I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge:  
  
Chorus:  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But who cares, I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge:  
  
Chorus: 2x  
... Cause I'm not apart...  
I'm not apart...  
I'm, not, apart, of it, anymore...
