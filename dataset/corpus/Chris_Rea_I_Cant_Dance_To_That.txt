Now there's no storyline  
Just a real good time  
And I don't want to seem to be mistaken  
But there's a tale to tell  
On this road to hell  
It's in between the lines the case I'm making  
  
Oh, lord, look my way  
Save me from these crazy things I see  
I don't know what's going on round here these days  
But I can't dance to that  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
'cause I can't dance to that  
  
If you'll excuse me please  
You see I got to go  
And take myself before I'm past redemption  
A voice is calling out  
As if I didn't know  
This wretched road is paved with good intentions  
All the way  
Down this Judas track  
I know it so well  
And I ain't going back  
I don't know what happened to the good time songs  
But I can't dance to that  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
'cause I can't dance to that  
  
Tell me what you know  
Take away these chains  
What stood in front of me it looks so pretty  
But I can't dance to a cold machine  
Oh, lord, and every drummer you know just what I mean  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this
