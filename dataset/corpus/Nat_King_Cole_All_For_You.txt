When you raise your eyes and make believe,  
All the stars come out and paint a world of blue.  
There's my heart right up your sleeve  
Waiting all for you.  
  
When you smile on me, the world is mine,  
And the dreams I dream, I know will all come true.  
Every care becomes divine  
Waiting all for you.  
  
My heart is beating to the old refrain  
When I'm alone with you.  
My heart's repeating, "I'm in love again"  
Can't we hold a rendez-vous?  
  
You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing  
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything.  
Life would be a symphony,  
Waiting all for you.  
  
My heart is beating to the old refrain  
When I'm alone with you.  
My heart's repeating, "I'm in love again"  
Can't we hold a rendez-vous?  
  
You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing  
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything.  
Life would be a symphony,  
Living all for you.
