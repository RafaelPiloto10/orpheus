I can't believe it, guess I'll never understand  
Seems to me, I'm lookin' at someone who's  
an unchanged man  
Tell me, what've I gotta do  
To make you see that she's always loved you  
Right there waitin' in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do, think about it  
  
[Chorus]  
She would never do a thing to hurt you  
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide  
You're takin everything she gives for granted  
You got it all and still I don't know why  
You're lovin' on the side  
  
If somebody told her 'bout your secret ways  
Do you think you'd ever find another  
who could take her place  
I'd give everything I own  
Just to have what you got at home  
But still you are never satisfied  
Why do you keep lovin' on the side when you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what I've gotta do  
To make you see that she always loved you  
Right there waitin' in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do,  
well think about it  
You're lovin' on the side  
Lovin' on the side  
  
[Chorus]
