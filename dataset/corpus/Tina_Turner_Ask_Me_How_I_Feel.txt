Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
When things are going wrong, why don't you ask me how I feel  
The night is awful cold, ask me how I feel  
You're much too loose to hold, why don't you ask me how I feel  
  
I close my eyes to follow you  
To my surprise you're so untrue  
And I'm crying, I'm dying  
  
Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
When you keep me hanging on, why don't you ask me how I feel  
The waters run so deep, ask me how I feel  
When I don't get any sleep, why don't you ask me how I feel  
  
And when you're down you lean on me  
You're a fool, too blind to see  
That I'm crying, I'm dying  
  
Oh I'm waiting in the storm, why don't you ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on, why don't you ask me how I feel  
When you stay out late at night, ask me how I feel  
When you think that I'm uptight, why don't you ask me how I feel oh  
  
You don't treat me tender no matter what I do  
But I'm the great pretender  
  
I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on?  
When you stay out late at night  
You never ask me how I feel, you just say that I'm uptight  
When you're down, I do for you  
And now I find that you're untrue
