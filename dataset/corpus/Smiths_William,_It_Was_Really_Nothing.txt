The rain falls hard on a humdrum town  
This town has dragged you down  
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town  
This town has dragged you down  
Oh, no, and everybody's got to live their life  
And God knows I've got to live mine  
God knows I've got to live mine  
William, William it was really nothing  
William, William it was really nothing  
It was your life...  
  
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:  
"Oh! Would you like to marry me?  
"And if you like you can buy the ring"  
She doesn't care about anything  
Would you like to marry me?  
And if you like you can buy the ring  
I don't dream about anyone - except myself!  
Oh, William, William it was really nothing  
William, William
