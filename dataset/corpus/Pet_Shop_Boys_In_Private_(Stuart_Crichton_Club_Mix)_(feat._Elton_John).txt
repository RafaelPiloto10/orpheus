Take your time and tell me  
Why you lie?  
I realise  
That we've been found out this time  
We should stand together  
If we can  
But what you planned  
Means there's a difference between ...  
What you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
So discrete (She's so discrete)  
I never tried to meet (She never)  
Your friends or interfere (No)  
I took a back seat (Back seat) between ...  
On what you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
What you gonna say  
When you run back to your wife  
I guess it's just the story of her life  
What you gonna say  
So take your time  
And tell me, when did you lie  
Oh, I mean  
All the time (No)  
That there's a difference (A difference) between (between)  
On what you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
Tell me what you gonna say (In private) Oooh  
(You still want my love, we're in this together)  
What you gonna say, what you gonna do  
(And what you're gonna do) Baby  
(in public) What you gonna say  
(Say you were never in love) Oooh  
(that you can remember) What you gonna say  
Say in private
