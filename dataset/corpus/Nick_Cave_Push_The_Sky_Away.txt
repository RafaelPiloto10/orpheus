I was right  
I was right  
Oh, the sun, the sun  
The sun is rising from the field  
  
I've got a feeling  
I just can't shake  
I've got a feeling  
That just won't go away  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if your friends think  
That you should do it different  
And if they think  
That you should do it the same  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if you're feeling  
You've got everything you came for  
If you got everything  
And you don't want no more  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And some people  
Say it's just rock'n roll  
Oh, but it gets you  
Right down to your soul
