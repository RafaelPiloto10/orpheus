Kill eye tumbling come out of the sky  
Kill eye a fiery retreat from the stars  
Kill eye he came clambering over the wall  
Kill eye halfway to hell and beyond  
I want to be forgiven  
I want to laugh with children  
Won't you ever forgive me  
Please please forgive me  
I want to hug my mother  
And the sky above her  
I want the earth to open up  
And hold me  
Kill eye shoot your way out of the bank  
Kill eye watch the security guard  
Kill eye you separate a man from his life  
I want to be forgiven  
I want to laugh with children  
I want to ride the pony  
Be your one and only friend  
I will love you till the end  
Kill eye halfway to hell and beyond  
I want to hug my mother  
And the sky above her  
I want the earth to open up  
I want the earth to open up
