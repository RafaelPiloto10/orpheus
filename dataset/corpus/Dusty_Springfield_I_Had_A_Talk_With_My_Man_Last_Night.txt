I had a talk with my man last night  
He reassured me everything was still all right  
As the night grew light  
My blues got bright  
He made me know  
I was the star of the show  
  
He said he was mine all to myself  
And i won't, and he won't, ever need nobody else  
He took me in his arms  
And turned on my love  
Ooh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night  
  
He said never again lonely would i be  
And that's when he asked to marry me  
I began to cry  
He kissed the tears from my weeping eyes  
Oh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night
