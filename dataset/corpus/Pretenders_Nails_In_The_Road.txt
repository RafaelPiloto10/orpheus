If this is public transportation  
What are you doing here?  
Royalty and people like thee  
Should queue up in the rear  
  
My patience has worn thin  
My tires are gonna explode  
Yeah, yeah  
Every time I try to get close to you  
You throw nails in the road  
  
This is a sticky situation  
Will require a measure of tact  
We just don't like to mix it with you all  
It's a cultural fact  
  
My patience has worn thin  
My tires are gonna explode  
Yeah, yeah  
Every time I try to get close to you  
You throw nails in the road  
  
This is a cleanup job  
Everybody grab a mop  
You want to further you position  
Well look what floats on top  
On top...  
  
Well there's class and then there's class  
But we're above all that  
The butcher and the baker  
And the thief and the witch  
And the aristocrat  
  
My patience has worn thin  
My tires are gonna explode  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Every time I try to get close to you  
You throw nails in the road  
You throw nails in the road  
You throw nails in the road  
You throw nails in the road  
You throw nails in the road  
You throw nails in the road
