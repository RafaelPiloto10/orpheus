I said, baby, baby, baby .. baby, baby, baby .. ooh baby baby, baby...  
Baby drives me crazy  
Baby drives me crazy  
Crazy about you baby  
  
Baby drives me crazy  
We're a little bit crazy  
Aren't we baby?  
  
Sugar with the sweet night  
Sugar with the midnight  
Sweet on you sugar  
  
Love a little true love  
Sweet on you honey  
  
I said, baby, baby, baby ... baby, baby, b-b-b-baby, b-b-b-b-b-b-baby  
I said, baby! baby!
