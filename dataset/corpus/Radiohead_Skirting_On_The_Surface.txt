When we realize we're only to die then we're out of here  
We're just skirting on the surface  
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear  
We're just skirting on the surface  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends  
We're just skirting on the surface  
  
When we realize we're only held in suspension  
Until someone comes along and shakes us  
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web  
Will we die upon the surface?  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends  
We're just skirting on the surface
