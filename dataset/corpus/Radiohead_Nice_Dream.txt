They love me like I was their brother  
They protect me, listen to me.  
They dug me my very own garden  
Gave me sunshine, made me happy  
Nice dream, nice dream  
Nice dream  
  
I call up my friend the good angel  
But she's out with, her answer-phone.  
She says she'd love to come help but  
The sea would electrocute us all  
Nice dream, nice dream  
Nice dream, nice dream  
  
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough  
Nice dream, if you think that you belong enough  
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough  
Nice dream, if you think that you belong enough  
  
(Now come home, now come home)  
(Now come home, now come home)  
  
Nice dream, nice dream  
Nice dream, nice dream.
