I've been working so hard  
I'm punching my card  
Eight hours for what?  
Oh, tell me what I got  
I've got this feeling  
That time's just holding me down  
I'll hit the ceiling or else  
I'll tear up this town  
  
Now I gotta cut loose  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You're playing so cool, obeying every rule  
Dig a way down in your heart  
You're burning yearning for some  
Somebody to tell you that life ain't passing you by  
I'm trying to tell you  
It will if you don't even try  
You'll get by if you'd only  
  
Cut loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Ooh-wee Marie shake it, shake it for me  
Woah, Milo come on, come on let's go  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You got to turn me around and put your  
Feet on the ground, now take the hold of all  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
I'm turning you loose  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose (footloose)  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues,  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut footloose
