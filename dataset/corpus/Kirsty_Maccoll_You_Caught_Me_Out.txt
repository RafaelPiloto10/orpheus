Just dropped in, I was driving past  
You know I missed you since I saw you last  
It gets lonely since you haven't been around  
Little things don't make me cry  
But still I think you could have told me why  
You had to move out to the other side of town  
Ah you caught me out  
Ah you caught me out  
But when I saw you walking out the door  
You know I just couldn't take any more  
I started crying  
Every night I lie awake  
Afraid what shape my dreams might take  
I call your name out but I never hear a sound  
You could say there's no love lost  
But now I sit down and I count the cost  
I wasn't ready to surrender what I found  
Ah you caught me out  
Ah you caught me out  
But when I saw you walking out the door  
You know I just couldn't take any more  
I started crying  
It doesn't seem there's any way  
To say the things I wanna say  
It's too late for me to explain I love you  
Ah you caught me out  
Ah you caught me out  
But when I saw you walking out the door  
You know I just couldn't take any more  
I started crying  
Ah you caught me out  
I started crying
