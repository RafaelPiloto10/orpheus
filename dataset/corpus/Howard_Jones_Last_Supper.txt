This is our last supper together  
The last time we share in this intimacy  
We have created a suffering circle that threatens to  
Tighten and destroy you and me  
  
Yesterday I flicked through the snapshots we  
Kept to remember the tender times  
Each little picture and each little memory should bring back a smile  
But now brings back a tear of regret  
  
Chorus  
Letting go is so hard  
Letting go is so hard  
So let us love tonight, thinking now of our greatest moments before we  
Release from this death in life drink the wine and take my hand  
Is it a crime to live this lie?  
I know that we will never share, share this love again  
  
But we both must be starting again, each one of  
Us too strong in these chains to remain  
This tug of war has weakened our purpose and  
Pulled us apart from beginning to end
