I know you've heard these word a hunder of the time before  
And you've been hurting so your heart...(sorry I don't know)  
Love broke your heart and broke your life  
Look in my eyes you'll see a love...  
Tender and strong enough for you  
You can trust this love...  
Chorus: from the heart I'm giving you everything everything  
From the heart I promise you that I'll be there  
I'll be there to love you  
From the heart I'm showing you're all I feel all I feel yeah from the heart
from the heart  
I will protect you and respect you and give all you need  
And when you reach for love you only need to reach for me  
These arms will never let you down  
That's day...  
I offer you to every storm  
I'll keep you safe I'll keep you warm  
And you had no doubt  
You're the one I'm living for  
Repeat chorus

Keep this all I got with all I got inside  
Repeat chorus
