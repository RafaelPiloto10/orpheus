Tommy:  
  
I overwhelm as I approach you  
Make your lungs hold breath inside!  
Lovers break caresses for me  
Love enhanced when I've gone by.  
  
You'll feel me coming,  
A new vibration  
From afar you'll see me  
I'm a sensation.  
  
They worship me and all I touch  
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,  
Pleasant shudders shake their senses  
My warm momentum throws their stance.  
  
You'll feel me coming  
A new vibration  
From afar you'll see me  
I'm a sensation.  
  
I leave a trail of rooted people  
Mesmerized by just the sight,  
The few I touch are now disciples  
Love as one I am the light...  
  
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me  
I'm coming...  
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer  
I'm coming...  
I'm a sensation.
