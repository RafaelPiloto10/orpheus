Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company  
And like some angel's haloed brow  
You reek of purity  
I see your armor plated breast  
Has long since lost its sheen  
And in your death mask face  
There are no signs which can be seen  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador a vulture sits, upon your silver sheath  
And in your rusty scabbard now, the sand has taken seed  
And though your jewel-encrusted blade  
Has not been plundered still  
The sea has washed across your face  
And taken of its fill  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador there is no time, I must pay my respect  
And though I came to jeer at you  
I leave now with regret  
And as the gloom begins to fall  
I see there is no aureole  
Though you came with sword held high  
You did not conquer, only die  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind
