Got no place to go  
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico  
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin  
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in  
  
We got airplane rides  
We got California drowning out the window side  
We've got big black cars  
And we got stories how we slept with all the  
Movie stars  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drink my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Hop on my choo-choo  
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit  
If you dress me up in pink and white  
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight  
  
She's my angel  
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me  
Cause she liked to scream at me  
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
And fly away to someone new  
  
Everybody's gone  
They left the television screaming that the radio's on  
Someone stole my shoes  
But there's a couple of bananas  
And a bottle of booze  
  
Oh well, happy new year's baby!  
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day  
Or we could simply pack our bags  
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Flush my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new
