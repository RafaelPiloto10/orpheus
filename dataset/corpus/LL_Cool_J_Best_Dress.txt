But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers  
Candy apple M3's, slidin' out gently  
Rollin up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then  
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons  
  
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough  
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough  
Your man was locked up 'cause the cops popped up  
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up  
  
He was yo' crush, you was his crutch  
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch  
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much  
Now it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust  
  
Standin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses  
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it  
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'  
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
Her boyfriend's comin' through with them hickeys on his neck  
He claims he's lovin' her but never shows her no respect  
All she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress  
Big momma, huh momma, now lil' momma is next  
  
You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect  
'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps  
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex  
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh  
  
somethin' new, nothin' borrowed, nothin' blue, no weddin' dress  
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left  
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself  
There's no love until you love you remind yourself  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
To all my ghetto girls all around the world  
You know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls  
Keep fightin', uh baby girl keep fightin', yeah, yeah  
To all my ghetto queens survivin' by all means  
  
There's a rock and a hard place you somewhere in between  
Keep fightin', uh baby girl keep fightin', yeah  
To all my single mommas you been strugglin' with drama  
Doin' what you gotta but still keepin' your honor  
Keep fightin', uh, baby girl keep fightin', yeah yeah, sing it  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Get your best dress on tonight
