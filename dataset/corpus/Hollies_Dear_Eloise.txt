Dear Eloise, I am writing to say  
A number of funny things I heard today.  
I heard that he's left you, and run off to see.  
Could be the best thing that's happened to me.  
  
Writing a letter to make you feel better.  
Sorry to hear that he left you that way.  
I could have told ya,  
He was much older,  
So much older than you.  
  
You loved him blindly,  
He treated ya kindly,  
Until he found out what he could get from you.  
You should have departed, before he got started.  
Now you've been burned just like I said you would.  
  
Please read my letter closely,  
It's beneficial to you,  
Must read in between the lines,  
A message you will see.  
If you use your mind you'll find,  
I want you bad with me-eee-eeee  
  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba- ba ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba- ba ba ba ba ba ba

So much older that you.  
So much older than you.
