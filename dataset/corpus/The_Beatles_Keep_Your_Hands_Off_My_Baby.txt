We've been friends for oh, so long  
I let you share what's mine  
But when you mess with the boy I love  
It's time to draw the line  
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by  
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time  
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by  
Girl, you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
I don't mind when you lend my clothes  
My jewelry and such  
But, honey, let's get something straight  
There's one thing you don't touch  
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby  
Girl, you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by  
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time  
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by  
Girl, you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
(Keep your hands)  
Oh, keep your hands (off my) off my baby (bay-ee-a-by )  
I ain't gonna tell you twice  
(Keep your hands off my)  
He's mine (bay-ee-a-by)  
Yay, yay, yeah, he's mine  
(Keep your hands off my)  
You better watch yourself, now (bay-ee-a-by)
