Hey Now  
This year I've been feeling kinda weary  
Oh,next year I may not come back at all  
Sometimes I hear the angels a singing  
Or I can hear my mothers call  
Give me a cadillac for a carriage  
And you'll hear my name  
Whispering through the trees  
You can call me Mr. Black  
You can call me Mr. Grey  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
And tonight I'm feeling kinda beautiful  
Tonight I'm feeling kinda warm  
And there's a touch of humour  
In everything I see  
Oh there's a touch of scorn  
Give me a Mercedes for my baggage  
And hear my name on the breeze  
You can all me Mr. Black  
You can all me Mr. Green  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
If you please Mr. Freeze  
Solo  
Give me a cadillac for a carriage  
And you'll hear my name  
Whispering through the trees  
You can call me Mr. Black  
You can call me Mr. Grey  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
Oh Mr. Freeze  
Give me a Mercedes for my baggage  
And hear my name on the breeze  
You can all me Mr. Black  
You can all me Mr. Green  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
If you please
