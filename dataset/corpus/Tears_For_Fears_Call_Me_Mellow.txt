Fill the sky with love  
Fill the sky with love  
  
I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep  
Wishful and ashen, slightly bedraggled  
Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon  
Roaming the forest, lupine and rabid  
  
Whoa is she wild?  
Does she see my inner child?  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
If only I was half my age and she was older  
We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island  
I though it's gravity that drags down my balloon  
She stays in orbit way after midnight  
  
Woah slip and slide  
Does she go all dewey-eyed?  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
She'll dress down for us  
She'll break new ground for us  
Watching me cracking up  
  
She'll hang round fellas  
With all the groundswellers  
Driving me like a truck  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
Fill the sky with love [Repeat: x3]
