In the beginning into the darkness  
The spirit's moving upon the water  
You spoke the words, "Let there be light"  
Out of the chaos came the promise  
The universe rose and applauded  
When you commanded the new born sun to rise  
  
You are the day spring you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes hope of the broken world  
  
Into my weakness, into my darkness  
Your spirit's moving upon my heart and  
You speak the words, "Let there be light"  
Into my chaos comes your promise  
The new is rising the old is past on  
You are reviving and making all things right  
  
You are the day spring, you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes hope of the broken world  
  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
  
You are the day spring, you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes, hope of the broken world  
Restoration come, hope of the broken world
