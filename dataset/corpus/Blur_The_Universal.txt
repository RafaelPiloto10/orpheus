This is the next century  
The Universal is free  
You can find it anywhere  
Yes, the future has been sold  
Every night we are gone  
And to karaoke songs  
We like to sing along  
Although the words are wrong  
  
It really, really, really could happen  
Yes, it really, really, really could happen  
When the days seem to fall straight through you  
Just let them go  
  
No one here is alone  
Satellites in every home  
The Universal is here  
Here for everyone  
Every paper that you read  
Says tomorrow is your lucky day  
Well, here's your lucky day
