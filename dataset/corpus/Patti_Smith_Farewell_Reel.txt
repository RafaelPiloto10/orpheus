It's been a hard time  
And when it rains  
It rains on me  
The sky just opens  
And when it rains  
It pours  
  
I walk alone  
Assaulted it seems  
By tears from heaven  
And darling I can't help  
Thinking those tears are yours  
  
Our wild love came from above  
And wilder still  
Is the wind that howls  
Like a voice that knows it's gone  
Cause darling you died  
And well I cried  
But I'll get by  
Salute our love  
And send you a smile  
And move on  
  
So darling farewell  
All will be well  
And then all will be fine  
The children will rise  
Strong and happy be sure  
Cause your love flows  
And the corn still grows  
And God only knows  
We're only given  
As much as the heart can endure  
  
But I don't know why  
But when it rains  
It rains on me  
The sky just opens  
And when it rains  
It pours  
  
But I look up  
And a rainbow appears  
Like a smile from heaven  
And darling I can't  
Help thinking that smile  
Is yours
