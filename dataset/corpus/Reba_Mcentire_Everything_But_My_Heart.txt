The bed is cold and empty in the morning light  
I'm searching for my pride through tangled covers  
And loneliness is not a very pretty sight  
When you first discover  
  
That it's over  
A hard one to lose  
Love hurts  
It's sad but true  
He wanted my arms around him  
Oh without a doubt  
He wanted my warm red lips  
Soft on his mouth  
He loved all of me  
Except for one small part  
He wanted everything  
Everything but my heart  
  
Love is not an easy word for me right now  
Too much has happened to my feelings  
It's gonna be rough not having him around  
Until time has done some healing  
And it's over  
And I'm over you  
  
Love hurts  
It's sad but true  
He wanted my arms around him  
Oh without a doubt  
He wanted my warm red lips  
Soft on his mouth  
He loved all of me  
Except for one small part  
He wanted everything  
Everything but my heart
