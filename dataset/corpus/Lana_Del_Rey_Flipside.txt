Are you gonna hurt me now  
Are you gonna hurt me later  
Are you gonna go to town  
Maybe you should play safer  
You got me all dressed up tonight  
Spring is staying on the radio  
You've got me all freaked out tonight  
Somebody you're telling me but I don't know  
  
You don't wanna break me down  
You don't wanna say goodbye  
You don't wanna turn around  
You don't wanna make me cry but  
You got me, watch  
Baby I'm a flipside liquour  
Catch you again  
It comes and goes  
Baby I'm a flipside liquour  
Catch me again  
  
Drinks in the patio  
  
Are you gonna tell me now  
Are you gonna tell me later  
Cause if you think that I don't know  
I'm coming after to say you're crazy

Dressed up just to hear your voice  
I already know what you got in store  
Why I go baby I don't know  
  
Cause You don't wanna break me down  
You don't wanna say goodbye
