You've come to me again my friend.  
I've been waiting so long.  
Life seems strange and hard sometimes,  
Maybe I won't make it this time.  
  
Oh They've taken all I have,  
But I just need what's left of  
Today, and you can wash it all away.  
When it all comes down and I'm feeling tired and afraid,  
You're always there, and seem come when  
I've nothing left to give away.  
  
Now I wait for your winds to come and give me breath for  
Another day, and your rain to wash me.  
  
I feel the rain coming.  
I feel it in my heart, take away my pain.  
I feel the rain coming.  
Wash me down, wash me down.  
  
Here comes the rain.  
Hold me now, just for awhile.  
  
I feel like a candle flame in the wind.  
The dust of my deeds past, covers me, like a fading lie.  
  
I feel the rain coming.  
I feel it in my heart, wash away my pain.  
Wash me down, wash me down.  
I feel the rain coming.  
  
Here comes the rain.
