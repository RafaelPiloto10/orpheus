You punch your way through a world of good intentions  
People don't matter, all you want to do is win  
And nothing ever comes too fast for a man of means  
'Cause all you want is everything  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Whoa, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Time finds you in a new green situation  
Your savoir faire fits you like a second skin  
And nothing ever comes too fast for a man of means  
'Cause all you want is everything  
  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
  
Nothing can stop you now  
No one can show you how  
Nothing can touch you now  
  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
  
Nothing can stop you now  
No one can show you how  
And nothing can touch you now  
  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life, Yeah  
  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
Well all right  
'Cause you're living the Big Life  
  
Big Life  
Big Life  
Big Life
