Girl, when the moon across the water starts to rise  
I'll be looking for tomorrow and I'll see it in your eyes  
Girl, though the strongest heart'll shatter in a storm  
Now we got this love that we can run to  
Tonight, I'll keep you warm  
  
(Chorus)  
Man to woman  
When you're lying next to me  
Man to woman  
Girl you're everything I need  
Hold on, we'll always be  
Always you and me  
Hold me close  
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've known  
I can feel the fire that burns inside you  
Look how this love has grown  
  
(Chorus)  
Man to woman (man to woman)  
Man to woman (man to woman)  
Just say we'll always be  
Always you and me  
I want to hold you in the night  
Can't you see  
That I'm just livin' for your light  
I want the world to know  
I can't let you go  
  
(Chorus)  
Man to woman (man to woman)  
Man to woman (man to woman)  
I want the world to see  
Baby what you mean to me
