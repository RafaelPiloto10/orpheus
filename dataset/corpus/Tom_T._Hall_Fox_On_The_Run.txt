[Chorus]  
She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river  
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun  
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her  
And left me to die like a fox on the run  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run  
  
Now everybody knows the reason for my fall  
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall  
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride  
Like a lonely fox, boys, i need a place to hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, we'll drink a glass of wine, boys, to purify our soul  
We'll talk about the world and the friends we used to know  
I see a string of girls who have put me on before  
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at the door  
  
[Chorus]
