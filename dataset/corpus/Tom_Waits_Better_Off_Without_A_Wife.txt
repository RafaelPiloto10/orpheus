All my friends are married  
Every Tom and Dick and Harry  
You must be strong  
To go it alone  
Here's to the bachelors  
And the bowery bums  
And those who feel that they're the ones  
Who are better off without a wife  
I like to sleep until the crack of noon  
Midnight howlin' at the moon  
Goin' out when I wanto, comin' home when I please  
I don't have to ask permission  
If I want to go out fishing  
And I never have to ask for the keys  
Never been no Valentino  
Had a girl who lived in Reno  
Left me for a trumpet player  
Didn't get me down  
He was wanted for assault  
Though he said it weren't his fault  
Well the coppers rode him right  
Out of town  
(chorus) selfish about my privacy  
As long as I can be with me  
We get along so well I can't believe  
I love to chew the fat with folks  
And listen to all your dirty jokes  
I'm so thankful for these friends  
I do receive  
(chorus)
