Sister I'm heading out of alabama  
So you better think fast  
The wind is gonna pick me up now  
And the rain won't slack  
I'm heading down to georgia  
So don't lose track  
Of where you've been and where you're going now  
Who you've seen and what they lack  
And why you come undone  
Every time you go there  
You come undone  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
I know your heart's in danger  
And so is your life  
I said you learn to trust a stranger  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Well the moon won't be enough  
(sister)  
And light the embers of another  
And the night won't won't seem so rough  
Sister  
  
Ah  
There was a bloody beast of burden  
(i wish I was a mother)  
On a dark texas road  
(with a baby at my breast)  
A woman in a family way  
(i am just a farmer)  
And a car that lost control  
(with a milkcow and a mess)  
I'm studying the distance  
(i wish I was a mother)  
Between the blanket and the gun  
(with a baby at my breast)  
I got ten hours to natchez  
(i am just a farmer)  
And another ten home  
(with a milkcow and a mess)  
Well I'm goin' home  
Yes  
  
I know your heart's in danger  
(sister)  
And so is your life  
(sister)  
I say learn to trust a stranger  
(learn to trust)  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Yeah the moon won't be enough  
And light the embers of another  
And the night won't seem so rough  
Sister  
Go ahead  
I said come on  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
  
I said it's trust that brought me here  
And trust will bring me home
