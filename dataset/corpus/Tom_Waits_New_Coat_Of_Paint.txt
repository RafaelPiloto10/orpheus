Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress  
Baby I'll a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away  
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day  
Our love needs a transfusion let's shoot it full of wine  
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line.  
  
So let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set em' up, set em' up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress baby  
I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky
