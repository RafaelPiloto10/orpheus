I fell in love next to you  
Burning fires in this room  
It just fits, light and smooth  
Like my feet in my shoes  
Little one, lie with me  
Sew you heart to my sleeve  
We'll stay quiet underneath  
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
Teach my skin those new tricks  
Warm me up with your lips  
Heart to heart, melt me down  
It's too cold in this town  
Close your eyes, lean on me  
Face to mouth, lips to cheek  
Feeling numb in my feet  
You're the one  
To help me get to sleep  
  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes
