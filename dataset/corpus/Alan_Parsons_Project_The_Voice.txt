It's almost a feeling you can touch in the air  
You look all around you, but nobody's there  
It's been a long time now since you've been aware  
That somebody's watching you  
  
He's gonna get you  
  
Sooner or later when your big chances come  
You'll look for the catches, but there'll be none  
Remember before you grab the money and run  
That someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice  
  
Jumping with shadows that come up from behind  
You're scared of the darkness that's there in your mind  
You're frightened to move because of what you might find  
Someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice
