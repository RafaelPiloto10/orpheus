I don't care if my lady's gone  
As long as you give me just what I want.  
I've been losin' my direction,  
Got to find a new connection.  
  
You have wasted the love I tasted,  
Now I'm really gettin' hungry more and more.  
Been a long time, had a bad sign.  
Tell me what am I fighting for?  
  
Let me know you feel it,  
You know I really need it.  
Keep on pushin' for more,  
Lay down, stay down.  
I got something to find,  
There's one thing I really need.  
I'm gonna tell you right now,  
Lay down, stay down.  
  
Lookin' for trouble, I guess that's right.  
When I was young I was taught to fight.  
It's been long gone since I had known,  
Now I'm headin' for some more.  
  
Let me know you feel it,  
You know I really need it.  
Keep on pushin' for more,  
Lay down, stay down.  
I got something to find,  
There's one thing I really need.  
I'm gonna tell you right now,  
Lay down, stay down.  
  
Let me know you feel it,  
You know I really need it.  
Keep on pushin' for more,  
Lay down, stay down.

There's one thing I really need.  
I'm gonna tell you right now,  
Lay down, stay down.
