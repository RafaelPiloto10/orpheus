Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions  
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor  
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where  
Never mind their questions there's no answer for  
The roll of the harbor wake  
The songs that the rigging makes  
The taste of the spray he takes  
And he learns to give  
He aches and he learns to live  
He stakes all his silver  
On a promise to be free  
Mermaids live in colonies  
All his sea dreams come to me  
  
City satins left at home I will not need them  
I believe him when he tells of loving me  
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you  
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me  
Come down from the neon nights  
Come down from the tourist sights  
Run down till the rain delights you  
You do not hide  
Sunlight will renew your pride  
Skin white by skin golden  
Like a promise to be free  
Dolphins playing in the sea  
All his sea dreams come to me  
  
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings  
I am smiling at your circles in the air  
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping  
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share  
A dream that you love someone  
A dream that the wars are done  
A dream that you tell no one but the gray sea  
They'll say that you're crazy  
And a dream of a baby  
Like a promise to be free  
Children laughing out to sea  
All his sea dreams come to me
