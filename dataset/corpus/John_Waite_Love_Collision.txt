Ain't it beautiful  
Don't it make you feel complete  
It comes into your life  
Then sweeps you right off your feet  
  
Time stands still for two lovers  
And it's intangible  
But it hits like steel  
It stops me in my tracks  
  
Makes my private world unsealed  
A crashed car  
A communication failsafe  
We could share this vision  
  
In fact we've got no choice  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
Ain't it something else  
  
Like skydiving into Shangri-la  
And the clearest cool is the zeal-blue heaven  
And you can't quite put your finger on it  
And you could be anywhere  
  
Anytime anyplace in your lover's arms  
Could be paradise or walkin' on thin ice  
We can share this vision  
We're on some one-way street  
  
Exchanging cigarettes and glances  
We both feel the heat  
It's a love collision  
Love collision  
  
There's no decision  
It's a love collision  
If I close my eyes  
Visualizing you and I somewhere in this city  
  
And moments of desire  
The steady the silent gaze of lovers transfixed  
We could share this vision  
In fact we've got no choice  
  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
It's a love collision  
Love collision  
  
And there's no decision  
It's a love collision  
  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
  
Oh no  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision
