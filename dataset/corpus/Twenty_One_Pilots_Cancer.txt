[Verse 1]  
Turn away  
If you could get me a drink  
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded  
Call my aunt Marie  
Help her gather all my things  
And bury me in all my favorite colors  
My sisters and my brothers  
Still  
I will not kiss you  
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
  
[Chorus]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
[Verse 2]  
Now turn away  
'Cause I'm awful just to see  
And all my hairs abandoned all my body  
All my agony  
Know that I will never marry  
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo  
I'm counting down the days to go  
This just ain't livin'  
And I just hope you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
  
[Bridge]  
If you say (if you say)  
Goodbye today (goodbye today)  
I'll ask you to be true (I'll ask you to be true)  
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
Yes, the hardest part of this...  
  
[Outro]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (Call my)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (Call my)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)
