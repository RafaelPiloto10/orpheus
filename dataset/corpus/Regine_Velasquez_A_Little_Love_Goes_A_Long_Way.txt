A little love goes a long way  
And the little heart has a lot to say  
Love's like a song that is here to stay  
A little love goes a long, long way  
Good things are for those who are willing to wait  
And when your true love comes, heaven knows it's great  
Give a little love and just watch it grow  
When good things happen then the heart will know  
  
Chorus:  
Your heart can sing  
Love's do, re mi  
Your heart can know  
Love's a, b, c  
Love can be what it's got to be  
  
It's so easy to learn like 1, 2, 3  
Do, re, mi, a, b, c, 1, 2, 3  
A little love goes a long way  
A little love goes a long long way  
Just listen to what your heart can say  
Love can go stronger day by day  
A little love goes a long long way
