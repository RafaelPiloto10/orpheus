I keep leaning on your love  
[ steel ]  
It's funny how someone depends so heavily on someone else's love to survive  
Ah but that's the way I feel deep down inside of me  
And you're the only reason I'm alive  
Baby I'm leaning on your love the secret of happiness I found  
And I'll keep leaning on your love oh on your love that makes my world go
round  
The flowers couldn't grow without a falling rain  
Without the sun the world could not go on  
And without your precious love it would all be in vain  
For nothing else would matter with you gone  
Baby I'm leaning...
