I keep on churning away, but pay no mind  
You don't know nothing 'bout me but that's alright  
  
I tell you true that I'll be there and that's for sure  
You got to let me go everywhere, let me through that door  
Let me through that door  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting there's a cure  
But don't you put your finger right on it  
You'll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if you'll be liable to read it in the bible  
But I ain't going to say any more  
  
You can't build enough in a row but don't kid yourself  
You gotta know they're all insane  
They goin' ridin' on the range  
Don't need no hi-fly strutter  
Go babe, you're driving me crazy  
  
You got a new shining beau  
It don't pay to love  
It don't pay to love  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting there's a cure  
But don't you put your finger right on it  
You'll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if you be liable  
To read it in the bible  
I ain't going to say any more  
  
Well there you go blaming yourself  
There you go hiding so deep in your shell  
You better not cry when your baby comes home  
Yeah you know she's going to find out somehow  
  
You're having a breakdown right here and now  
I guess you don't know where you're headed for now  
It's OK... you're going to live to see another day  
  
Lie, cheat, and beg, borrow, steal  
Gotta find a way to be real  
Show me something I ain't seen before  
We're gonna make it through that door  
  
You may be in love and love it's true  
But it's a romance that you can't use  
Give me something and take it away  
Gonna get it right some day  
You gonna get it right some day  
  
You say you got a bee in your bonnet  
You know for every sting there's a cure  
But don't you put your finger right on it  
You'll only make it hurt all the more  
  
I doubt if you be liable  
To read it in the bible  
I ain't going to say any more  
  
But there you go blaming yourself  
And there you go hiding  
So deep in your shell  
You better not cry when your baby comes home  
  
And you know she's going to find out somehow  
You're having a breakdown right here and now  
I guess you don't know where you're heading for now  
It's OK..... you're going to live to see another day
