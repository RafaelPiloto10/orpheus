Yesterday I saw you standing there With your hand against the pane  
Looking out the window At the rain  
  
And I wanted to tell you That your tears were not in vain  
But I guess we both knew We'd never be the same  
Never be the same  
  
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?  
Lions and lambs shall abide  
  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again  
Build it back again  
  
Why must we hide all these feelings inside? Lions and lambs shall abide  
  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again  
  
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again
