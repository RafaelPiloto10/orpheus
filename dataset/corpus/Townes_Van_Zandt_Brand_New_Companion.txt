I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
You know she cools me with her breathin'  
Chases away those howlin' bottles of wine  
  
She fits just like my guitar  
Man, she's near as tall as me  
She fits just like my guitar  
She's near as tall as me  
She lives way out the D train  
But she's Texas as can be  
  
She got a home-spun disposition  
Man, she's just as gentle as you please  
She got a home-spun disposition  
Man, she's just as gentle as you please  
She got arms just like two rattle snakes  
Legs just like a billow in the breeze  
  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I want to trace her with my body  
I want to track her with my mind
