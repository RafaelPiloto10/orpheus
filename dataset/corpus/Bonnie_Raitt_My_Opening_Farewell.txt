A lady stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching his restless day  
  
He turns from his window to me  
Sad smile his apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
Still he spares me words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind  
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's a world you know  
There's a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To lock you safe behind it's open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see  
Now my kind words find their way back to me  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's world you know  
Got a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
This is my opening farewell.
