Everybody's laughin' loud as it can be  
But please don't point your finger, especially not at me  
'Cause I'm not tryin' to be somebody, just do what I can  
But you just keep on laughin', call yourself a man  
I'm not lookin' for somebody to defend my case  
I've been scorned by more than one so stop this paper chase  
  
If you can't accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me, call yourself a man  
Tell me who you're foolin', is it not yourself?  
Go ahead be cool and, I'll just be myself  
And if you can't accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me, call yourself a man
