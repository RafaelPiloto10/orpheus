Ain't been in Little Rock but two weeks and here I am now  
Packing up and disappearing into thin air  
Girls in Little Rock are cute but I can't make my heart take root  
'Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
  
I need lots of sunshine I need lots of raindrops and I need to breathe the
open air  
I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden  
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed  
  
My love is not the kind that you need  
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair  
Cause bad seed don't grow just anywhere  
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed  
  
Next stop is Jacksonville now I don't know but I've got the feelin'  
And I might just kinda like it somewhere round there  
Hear tell there's fertile land white pearly silver sand  
And bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
So honey kiss goodbye...  
Hmm let me tell you honey I'm the bad seed
