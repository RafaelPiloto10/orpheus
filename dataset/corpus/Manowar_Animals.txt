Hear the call of the wild in us all  
It waits for the night to fall  
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night  
No holding back, let's  
I'm gonna give all you can take all night  
And leave you in the morning feeling right  
  
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me  
Gonna set it free  
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me  
Gonna set it free  
  
I've been looking, you've been watching from the side  
There's somethings you just can't hide  
Oh, you're getting wet, you're working up a sweat  
Your hair's standing up on end  
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?  
Tonight's one night you won't forget
