The city is a jungle, you better take care  
Never walk alone after midnight  
If you don't believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream  
Some of us will dream it forever  
Look around the corner and try not to scream  
It's me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison, you never escape  
You're forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger
