Please would you like to be somewhere floating free?  
Seems my destiny, Captain Fantasy  
Take a minute to go down beneath the reaches of sound  
You could be with me, Captain Fantasy  
  
And when I'm there, I'm here  
And when you're near, I'm there  
The only words of your life, Captain Fantasy  
And when I'm here, I'm there  
And when you're near, I'm here  
The only words of your life, Captain Fantasy
