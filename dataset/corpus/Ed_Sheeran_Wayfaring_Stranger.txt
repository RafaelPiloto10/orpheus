I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
(Hey-ey-ey yeah...)  
  
And I know dark clouds, will gather me  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me  
  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
Cause I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now
