We're tied to the 90's  
In the middle  
I'm terribly frightened  
I'm takin' it fast  
Takin' it slow  
There's thunder and lightning  
It's terribly frightening  
Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so  
Well I want to tell you  
We're tired of the 90's  
We're tired of the 90's  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Tied to the 90's  
  
Remember the 80's?  
(they were something)  
Were worse than the 90's  
We're stuck in a path  
Where fashion is fast  
And nothin' is lasting  
Its all ghetto blasting  
And Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so well I want to tell you  
We're tired of the 90's  
We're tired of the 90's  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Tied to the 90's  
  
Ah oh no  
It's nothing to go on  
The hifi five alive  
That's it I'm stayin' in bed  
'til my hair falls out  
Everything's over  
That said I like my wig  
And I hate myself  
I know its all in my head  
We're tired of the 90's (x3)  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Oh we're tied to the 90's  
We're tied to the 90's  
We're tied to the nines  
Tied to the nines  
Tied to the 90's
