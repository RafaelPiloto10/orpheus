We are one, we are one  
Distant rhythm in a troubled sky  
Angry clouds divide the sun  
Feels like thunder and so do I  
Bloody silence has begun  
Flying like a wounded dove  
  
Tomorrow comes undone  
Surrender don't come easily  
We try to get over, over  
Falling together, together  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
  
Ask the question, what's goin' on  
Why raging children run  
Where's the father's legacy  
Where's the harvest of the son  
Close your eyes and tell me what you see  
I see the same thing, same thing  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
No, surrender don't come easily  
We try to get over, over  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
We are many, we are one
