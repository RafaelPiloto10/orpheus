(ian hunter)  
  
I love your sulky eyes,  
I love your raven hair.  
I often fantasize  
A beautiful affair,  
A broken paradise  
'cause you don't even care.  
I love your sultry smile,  
I love to see you dance.  
Sometimes it drives me wild  
To know I've got no chance.  
Your boyfriend doesn't see  
You're flirting, teasing me.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Sometimes I'll act ok,  
Sometimes I'll try and hide.  
But when you look at me,  
I fall apart inside.  
Across a broken sea  
You took me for a ride.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Other lovers go home  
And I'm left here alone  
With my heart in my hand.  
I just can't understand  
Why you treat me this way.  
I just got to say.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Why don't you leave me,  
Leave me alone, oh)
