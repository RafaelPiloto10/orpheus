I've been a soldier quite a while  
And I would like to state  
The life is simply wonderful  
The Army food is great  
  
I sleep with ninety-seven others in a wooden hut  
I love them all  
They all love me  
It's very lovely but  
  
Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning  
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed  
  
For the hardest blow of all  
Is to hear the bugler call  
Ya gotta get up  
Ya gotta get up  
Ya gotta get up this morning  
  
Someday I'm going to murder the bugler  
Someday they're going to find him dead  
  
I'll amputate his reveille  
And step upon it heavily  
And spend the rest of my life in bed  
  
[alternate lines in 2nd chorus]  
And then I'll get that other pup  
The guy who wakes the bugler up
