The hand of God lays high above me  
I'll be good if you really love me  
Let me feel your mighty crunch  
As you rub me out like water, fire, coal, etc  
  
Let it be known today, if you've got two hands  
You're supposed to pray  
Fingers of fire, coal and lead  
Fondly love me till I'm dead  
  
The hand of God is thick and callous  
Bruised and torn from stones and sticks  
The hand of God has got a ring about the size of Texas  
Made of steel and rust, my fingers smear  
  
Let me try on your hand, and see if it fits  
Don't worry I won't touch anything unholy with it
