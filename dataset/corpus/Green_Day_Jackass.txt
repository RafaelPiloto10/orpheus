To know you is to hate you  
So loving you must be like suicide  
I don't mind if you don't mind  
I'm not the one that's going to die  
I guess I just can't listen  
To this one sided conversation again  
'Cause I don't care if you don't care  
No one ever said that life is fair  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
The center of attention  
Got an honorable mention once again  
Congratulations and salutations  
You're a figment of your own imagination  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
To know you is to bait you  
And you fell victim to your own denial  
I don't mind if you don't mind  
If you're wasting all your time
