None of you would help me when i baked by bread  
Now all of you would help me eat it  
I can see that you are very well fed  
This indicates that you don't need it  
Enough said  
  
Stop and let me tell you what tomorrow holds for you  
Stop and let me tell you 'bout a plan i have for you  
  
Take all the leaders from around the world  
Put them together in a great big ring  
Televise it as the lowest show on earth  
And let them fight like hell to see who's king  
Gather up the pieces when the fight is done  
Then you'll find out living really can be fun  
  
You wanted a world you could figure out  
But something happened while you were asleep  
You wanted a good life you could brag about  
Too bad they took the parts you wanted to keep
