I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I'm so ashamed  
You're in so much pain  
I blamed you when things didn't go my way  
If I didn't, you'd be here  
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear  
If I took another path  
Things would be so different, but they're not  
  
I could have just kept  
my big mouth closed  
I could have just done  
what I was told  
Maybe I should turned silver into gold  
But in front of you I was cold  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I thought we had it all  
You brought out the best in me  
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream  
I though we were indestructible  
I never imagine we could fall  
You wanna know how to make a laugh  
Telling your plans  
  
We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,  
End it up with walls, It would be so cool,  
Could've gone by the s in the country sides,  
With a back of great things, kissing eye to eye  
  
We could've do the world in a private jet  
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet  
We could've find a mountain in a perfect sun set,  
Writing out names across the sky  
We could've got a building built in the echo run  
We could've got a sales in west and sold out mount  
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die  
Instead I made you cry  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
Je suis d'sol'e  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not ashamed to say  
I wish I could have you back maybe one day
