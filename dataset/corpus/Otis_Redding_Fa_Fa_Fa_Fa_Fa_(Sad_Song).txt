Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
  
I keep singing them sad sad songs, y'all  
Sad songs is all I know  
I keep singing them sad sad songs, y'all  
Sad songs are all I know  
  
It has a sweet melody tonight  
Anybody can sing it any old time  
What in your heart puts you in a groove  
And when you sing this song  
It'll make you're whole body move, it goes  
  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
Your turn  
Our turn  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
Your turn, now  
  
All my life I've been singing them sad songs  
Trying to get my message to you  
But this is the only song (y'all) I can sing  
And when I get to singing my message to you  
  
It goes  
  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
Your turn  
  
It's a lovely song, y'all  
Sweet music, honey  
It's just a line, oh but  
It tells a story, baby  
You got to get the message  
A stone message, honey  
A lovely line, baby  
I'm worried in mind, watch me  
  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
Your turn, everybody's turn, everybody  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
One more time  
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa  
Worried alive
