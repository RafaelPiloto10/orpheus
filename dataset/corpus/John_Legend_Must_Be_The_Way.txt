It must be the way that you move inside my head  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Or it must be the songs that you sing to me in bed  
(Yeah, yeah)  
It must be the moon and the sun that sets so red  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Or it could be the stars when we're lying under them  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
It must be the way that with you, I don't pretend  
(No, no)  
And it must be your skin that when I touch just drives me mad  
(Yeah)  
Or it must be the blues that with you, I never have  
(Mo, no, no, no)  
It's all those little things that you do, make me so glad  
(Yeah, oh, yeah)  
And I'm telling you that I wonder just what it is to me that you do  
(Oh)  
But I say that it doesn't matter  
'Cause all I know is that there's something about you  
(Oh)  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
And I don't know what it is, baby, that you do  
But it must be the way that keeps me fallin' for you  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way  
It must be the, it must be the  
It must be the, It must be the way  
It must be the, It must be the  
It must be the, it must be the way
