Making love with you is like swimming in glue  
And I don't think I can do it anymore  
Well It started 6 months back, when you faked that heart attack  
But I brought you back and I put you at my bed  
Musta been playing sick cause you sure got better quick  
When you asked me for my love here's what I said  
"Sure you can stay, if you don't get in the way"  
What's a stupid boy like me to do  
Well I'm sick and tired of making love with you  
Yeah I'm sick and tired of making love with you  
Breaking up with you would be the smart thing to do, but I'm not smart, it's
half past two and your still here  
See I like the way you moan and I don't want to be alone  
So forgive me if I don't sound insincere  
Well it's don't matter what I don't say, cause I know your gonna stay  
What's a stupid boy like me to do  
Well I'm sick and tired of making love with you  
Yeah I'm sick and tired of making love with you  
  
In the morning you'll be gone,  
You won't ever hear this song  
It's the best a stupid boy like me could do  
Well I'm sick and tired of making love with you
