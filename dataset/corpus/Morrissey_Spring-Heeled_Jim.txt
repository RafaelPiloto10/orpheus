Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye  
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to"  
He takes on whoever flew through  
"Well, it's the normal thing to do"  
Aah  
  
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love  
Now kissing with his mouth full  
And his eyes on some other fool  
So many women  
His head should be spinning  
Ah, but no!  
Ah, but no!  
But no!  
Ah, no!  
  
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words :  
"There's no need to be so knowing  
Take life at five times the  
Average speed, like I do"  
Until Jim feels the chill  
"Oh, where did all the time go?"  
  
Once always in for the kill  
Now it's too cold  
And he feels too  
Old  
Too old  
Mmm, old  
  
La, la, la, la-la, la...
