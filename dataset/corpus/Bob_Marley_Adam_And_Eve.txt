The lord named Adam and Eve,  
To live a happy life.  
In the garden of Eden,  
But they disobeyed.  
  
I wanna know,  
Why they sin,  
In the garden of Eden.  
  
It's a devilman's affair,  
In the shake of a surfband.  
  
And they broke the fruit of life  
And everyone of us is living in sin.  
  
Any anywhere you go,  
Woman is the root of all evil.  
  
He was the first one to break a fruit  
And everyone of us is living in sin.
