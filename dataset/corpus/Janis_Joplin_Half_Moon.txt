Half moon, night time sky,  
Seven stars, Heaven's eyes.  
Seven songs on seven seas  
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me.  
  
Hey, fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Fill me like the sea, Lord,  
Not coming past, still at last  
Your love brings life to me,  
Your love brings life to me,  
Hey!  
  
Rings of cloud, arms aflame,  
Sunrise up to call your name,  
Sunrise up and it burn the ground  
Just to shine above the first true love I found.  
  
Hey! Fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Fill me like the sea, Lord,  
Not coming past, still at last  
Your love brings life to me,  
Your love brings life to me,  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah!  
  
Half moon, night time sky,  
Seven stars, Heaven's eyes,  
Seven songs on seven seas  
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me.  
  
Hey! Fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Fill me like the sea, Lord,  
Not coming past, still at last  
Lord! Fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Fill me like the sea, Lord,  
Not coming past, still at last  
  
Lord! fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Fill me like the sea, Lord,  
Not coming past, still at last  
Your love brings life to me,  
Your love brings life to me,  
Your love, la, la, la, la wah, whoa love, love  
Your love brings life to me, yeah.  
  
All right. We'll sue you! Oh, it's Sunday, right ?  
It's Monday now, right ? No ? Well, well, keep on rockin'.  
It's five minutes past Sunday ?  
Hey, you're still here, man ?  
It's Monday, it's legal, right.  
This is a very strange place you have.  
And if you ever need a drink that should be on Sunday,  
Man, that's the worst, ha ha!  
The worst day in the week and they close the bars ?  
I can't understand it!
