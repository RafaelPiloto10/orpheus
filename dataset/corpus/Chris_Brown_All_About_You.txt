How did you get so young  
I heard you were born today  
Heard that you came and found  
The sky and I just wanna say  
Look up the world is glad here to stay  
Have fun is time to give another day  
Sometimes the fire gets in your way  
That ain't nothing  
You can't blow away  
  
So make a wish  
I will have one too  
I wish I can stay with you  
Wish you knew  
How... Wishes to come true  
It's all about you  
It's all about you  
Today  
  
It's all about you (repeat)  
  
Girl do you want  
I swear I'll give you everything  
Look upfront flowers...  
Look up the world is glad here to stay  
Have fun is time to give another day  
Sometimes the fire gets in your way  
That ain't nothing  
You can't blow away  
  
So make a wish  
I will have one too  
I wish I can stay with you  
Wish you knew  
How... Wishes to come true  
It's all about you  
It's all about you  
Today
