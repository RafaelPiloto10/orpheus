THUNDER AND LIGHTNING I thought it was love  
That hurt so bad,  
But all of this time I was a fool being had.  
Now it's the last stop for you, baby,  
On my gravy train.  
Well, I don't understand  
How I could be so short of memory,  
How I could just leave my pride in the rain.  
  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Nobody's gonna wrap me 'round their finger.  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Ain't gonna let you treat me like a prisoner.  
  
You played with my mind,  
Baby, much too long.  
You played with my head  
Until all feelin' was gone.  
Now I'm out of patience and money,  
And my heart is numb.  
You kept me in the dark,  
But now I finally see some daylight.  
I've got a chance.  
I'm gonna run, baby, run.  
  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Nobody's gonna wrap me 'round their finger.  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Ain't gonna let you treat me like a prisoner.  
  
Nobody's gonna pull this thing back together.  
It's too far out of hand.  
If you wanna give it one more try,  
Try it with another man.  
  
[Guitar Interlude]  
  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Nobody's gonna wrap me 'round their finger.  
No more thunder and lightning.  
Ain't gonna let you treat me like a prisoner.  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
