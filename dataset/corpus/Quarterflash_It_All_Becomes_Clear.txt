Say goodbye to the life you've been living  
So long to the friends you hold dear  
You're life's been jarred and moved out of focus  
From far away will it all become clear?  
  
Where is the time given to love  
Where are the nights that we're missing  
Where is the joy that we knew  
Am I lost again, lost again, lost and confused?  
  
Standing close to the work you've been painting  
Shades and lines diffuse when so near  
Standing back does it all fall together  
From far away will it all become clear  
From far, far away it all becomes clear
