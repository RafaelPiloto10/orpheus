Who's gonna ride that chrome three wheeler  
Who's gonna make that first mistake  
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers  
All the way to fire lake  
Who wants to break the news about uncle Joe  
You remember uncle Joe  
He was the one afraid to cut the cake  
Who wants to tell poor aunt Sarah  
Joe's run off to fire lake  
Joe's run off to fire lake  
  
Who wants to brave those bronze beauties  
Lying in the sun  
With their long soft hair falling  
Flying as they run  
Oh they smile so shy  
And they flirt so well  
And they lay you down so fast  
Till you look straight up and say  
Oh lord  
Am I really here at last  
  
Who wants to play those eights and aces  
Who wants a raise  
Who needs a stake  
Who wants to take that long shot gamble  
And head out to fire lake  
Head out  
Who wants to go to fire lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to fire lake  
Head out  
Out to fire lake  
Who's gonna do it
