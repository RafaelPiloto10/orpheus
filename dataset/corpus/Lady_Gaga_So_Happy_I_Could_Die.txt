Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
  
I love that lavender blond  
The way she moves the way she walks  
I touch myself can't get enough  
And in the silence of the night  
Through all the tears and all the lies  
I touch myself and it's alright  
  
Just give in don't give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time eh-eh eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah I'll love you forever  
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die and it's alright  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
  
I am as vain as I allow I do my hair  
I gloss my eyes I touch myself all through the night  
And when something falls out of place  
I take my time I put it back  
I touch myself 'til I'm on track  
  
Just give in don't give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah I'll love you forever  
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die and it's alright  
So happy I could die and it's alright  
So happy I could die and it's alright  
  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah I'll love you forever  
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die and it's alright  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah I'll love you forever  
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die and it's alright
