If you see me coming up an open road  
With an empty glass and a single rose  
Take a turn towards the shifting light  
There you'll see my shadow lost in the night  
  
Endless flight has no directions now  
To a coward's kiss from a hero's vow  
If I could find the words, I'd pick up the phone  
If I was half a man, I wouldn't sleep alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Send me no more angels on a restless wind  
All I ever wanted were the simple things  
If a love like ours means anything  
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings  
  
Oh you shook your head like a wild horse  
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North  
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach  
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time just crawls here behind my eyes  
If the scar heals, can our love survive  
Life's only purpose seems so distant now  
If there's a chance at all won't you show me how  
  
[Chorus]
