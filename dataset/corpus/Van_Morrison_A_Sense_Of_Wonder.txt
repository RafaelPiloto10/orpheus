I walked in my greatcoat  
Down through the days of the leaves.  
No before after, yes after before  
We were shining our light into  
The days of blooming wonder  
In the eternal presence,  
In the presence of the flame.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
On and on and on and on we kept singing our song  
Over newtonards and comber,  
Gransha and the Ballystockart Road.  
This spike an boffyflow  
I said I could describe the leaves  
For Samuel and Felicity  
Rich, red browny, half burnt orange and green.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
It's easy to describe the leaves in the autumn  
And it's oh so easy in the spring  
But down through January and February  
It's a very different thing.  
  
On and on and on, through the winter of our discontent.  
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too  
I said I could describe the leaves for Samuel and what it means to you and me  
You may call my love Sophia, but I call my love philosophy.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
Wee Alfie at the castle picture house on the Castlereagh Road.  
Whistling on the corner next door where  
He kept Johnny McBride's horse.  
O solo mio by Mcgimsey  
And the man who played the saw  
Outside the city hall.  
Pastie suppers down at Davey's chipper  
Gravy rings, wagon wheels, barmbracks, snowballs.  
  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder
