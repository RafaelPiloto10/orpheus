How many tears must I cry  
Before your heart is satisfied  
How many flames must I walk through  
Before I make it up to you  
  
I wanna ask now how much  
Oh how much  
Oh how much  
Oh much does it have to hurt to make it right  
  
I've been a fool I confess  
But I know in your heart you love me no less  
Just tell me how bad must my body ache  
Before I live down my one mistake  
  
I keep wonderin' how much  
Oh how much  
Oh how much  
How much does it have to hurt to get back in your life  
  
Just how much does it thrill you  
To see me down on my knees  
Don't you know I love you baby .... mercy please  
  
I keep wonderin' how much  
Oh how much  
Oh how much  
Oh how much does it have to hurt to make it right  
I wanna make it right  
  
I keep wonderin' how much  
I keep wonderin' how much  
How many tears must I cry
