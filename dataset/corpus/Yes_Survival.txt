Sunshine is creeping in  
And somewhere in a field a life begins  
An egg too proud to rape  
The beginning of a shape of things to come  
That starts the run  
Life has begun  
Fly fast the gun  
  
The mother flew too late  
And life within the egg was left to fate  
Not really knowing how  
The world outside would take it when it came  
And life's the same  
For things we aim  
Are we to blame?  
  
Don't doubt the fact there's life within you  
Yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you  
All that dies  
Dies for a reason  
To put its strength into the seasons  
  
Survival,  
Survival  
They take away and they give  
The living's right to live (its all that we need to give)  
The living's right to know  
  
The egg breaks all is out  
The crawling bird begins to scream and shout  
Where is the parent bird?  
A loneliness arose and heard its name, ring in  
For lives, begin  
Survival win  
Survival sin  
  
So soon the evening comes  
And with it runs the aching fear of hate  
Could someone still remain  
Who thinks he still could gain by escaping fate?  
It's much too late  
Don't underrate  
Appreciate  
  
Don't doubt the fact there's life within you  
Yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you  
All that dies  
Dies for a reason  
To put its strength into the seasons  
Survival,  
Survival  
They take away and they give  
The living's right to live (its all that we need to give)  
The living's right to know  
  
Survival,  
Survival  
They take away and they give  
The living's right to live (its all that we need to give)  
  
The living's right to know (its all that we have to show)  
And we're all going (And we're all going)  
And we're all going (And we're all going)  
And we're all going somewhere
