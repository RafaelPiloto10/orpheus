And now to the love song. I'm sure you're familiar with love songs on the
order of he's just my bill, my man, my joe, my max, and so on where the girl
who sings them tells you that, although the  
She loves is anti-social, alcoholic, physically repulsive, or just plain
unsanitary, nevertheless she is his because he is hers, or something like
that. but as far as I know there has never been  
Pular song from the analogous male point of view, that is to say, of a man who
finds himself in love with, or in this case married to, a girl who has nothing
whatsoever to recommend her. I have  
Pted to fill this need. the song is called she's my girl.  
Sharks gotta swim, and bats gotta fly,  
I gotta love one woman till I die.  
To ed or dick or bob  
She may be just a slob,  
But to me, well,  
She's my girl.  
In winter the bedroom is one large ice cube,  
And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube.  
Her hairs in the sink  
Have driven me to drink,  
But she's my girl, she's my girl, she's my girl,  
And I love her.  
The girl that I lament for,  
The girl my money's spent for,  
The girl my back is bent for,  
The girl I owe the rent for,  
The girl I gave up lent for  
Is the girl that heaven meant for me.  
So though for breakfast she makes coffee that tastes like shampoo,  
I come home for dinner and get peanut butter stew,  
Or if I'm in luck,  
It's broiled hockey puck,  
But, oh well, what the hell,  
She's my girl,  
And I love her.
