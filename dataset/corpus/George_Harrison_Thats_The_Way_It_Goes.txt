There's a man talking on the radio  
What he's saying I don't really know  
Seems he's lost some stocks and shares  
Stops and stares  
He's afraid I know  
That's the way it goes  
  
There's a man talking of the promised land  
He'll acquire it with some Krugerrand  
Subdivide and deal it out  
Feel his clout  
He can stoop so low  
And that's the way it goes  
  
There's an actor who hopes to fit the bill  
Sees a shining city on a hill  
Step up close and see he's blind  
Wined and dined  
All he has is pose  
And that's the way it goes  
  
There's a fire that burns away the lies  
Manifesting in the spiritual eye  
Though you won't understand the way I feel  
You conceal, all there is to know  
That's the way it goes
