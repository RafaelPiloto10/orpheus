I remember thinking  
I'll go on forever only knowing  
I'll see you again  
But I know  
The touch of you is so hard to remember  
But like that touch I know no other  
  
And for sure we have danced  
In the risk of each other  
Would you like to dance  
Around the world with me  
  
I'll be falling all about my own thing  
And I know your the heaviest weight  
When you're not here that's hung  
Around my head  
  
And your lips burn wild  
Thrown from the face of a child  
And in your eyes  
The seeing of the greatest view, hey  
Do what you will, always  
Walk where you like, your steps  
Do as you please, I'll back you up  
  
I remember thinking  
Sometimes we walk  
Sometimes we run away  
But I know  
No matter how fast we are running  
Somehow we keep  
Somehow we keep up with each other  
  
I'll be falling all about my own thing  
And I know you're the heaviest weight  
When your not here that's hung  
Around my head  
  
And your lips burn wild  
Thrown from the face of a child  
And in your eyes  
The seeing of the greatest view, hey  
Do what you will,  
Always walk where you like, your steps  
Do as you please, I'll back you up
