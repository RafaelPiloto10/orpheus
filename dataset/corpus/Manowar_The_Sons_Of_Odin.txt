Here to the blaze  
I wander  
Through this black night  
I pounder  
The edge of our mighty swords  
Did clash  
Fallen by our axes  
Helmets smash  
Glory and fame  
Blood is our name  
Souls full of thunder  
Hearts of steel  
Killers of men  
Of warriors friend  
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers  
To the end  
One day too  
I may fall  
I will enter Odin's Hall  
I will die sword in hand  
My name and my deeds will  
Scorch the land  
Glory and fame  
Blood is our name  
Soul full of thunder  
Hearts of steel  
Killers of men  
Of warriors friend  
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers  
Sons of the gods today we shall die  
Open Valhalla's door  
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind  
Hail Gods of War  
[Solo]  
Sons of Odin we for  
By the hammer of Thor  
Ride down from the sky  
Another is born  
Another shall fall  
This day bent will die  
(oh) Glory and fame  
(oh) Blood is our name  
(oh) Souls full of thunder  
(oh) Hearts of steel  
(oh) Killers of men  
(oh) Of warriors friend  
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers  
(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die  
(oh) Open Valhalla's door  
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind  
(oh) Hail Gods of War  
(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die  
(oh) Open Valhalla's door  
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind  
(oh) Hail Gods of War  
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind  
(oh) Hail  
(oh) Gods  
(oh) of War!!!  
[Onward into the heart of the battle  
Fought the sons of Odin  
Outnumbered many times  
Still - they fought on  
Blood poured forth from their wounds  
Deep into the earth  
Vultures waited for the broken shells  
That once were bodies  
Thus Odin alone would choose the day  
They would enter Valhalla  
And in their hour of need  
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage  
Now gods embed  
They grows up from the ground  
Screaming like wild animals  
Such is the gift of absolute power  
No blade or weapon would hurt them  
They killed them and horses alike  
And all who stood before them died that day  
Hail Gods Of War]
