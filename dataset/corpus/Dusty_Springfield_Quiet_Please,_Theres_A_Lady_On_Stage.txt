Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
She may not be the latest rage  
But she's singing and she means it  
And she deserves a little silence  
  
Quiet please, there's a woman up there  
And she's been honest through her songs  
Long before your consciousness was raised  
Doesn't that deserve a little praise  
  
So put your hands together and help her along  
All that's left of the singer's  
All that's left of the song  
Stand for the ovation  
And give her one last celebration  
  
Quiet please, there's a person up there  
And she's been singing of the things  
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves  
Give her your respect if nothing else  
  
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
Conductor, turn the final page  
And when it's over we can all go home  
But she lives on -- on the stage alone.
