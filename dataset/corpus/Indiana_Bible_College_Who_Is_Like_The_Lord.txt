Chorus  
Who is like the Lord  
Nobody  
Who is like the Lord  
No no no no no, nobody  
Who is like the Lord  
Nobody  
Who is like the Lord  
No no no no no, nobody  
  
If our God is for us  
Who can be against us  
He will keep His promise  
There's nobody like Him  
  
What can separate us  
From the love of Jesus  
He will keep His promise  
There's nobody like Him  
Nobody like Him  
  
Verse  
There is none  
In Heaven or earth like You  
  
Vamp  
Lord we declare  
Who can compare  
Who would even dare  
There is no one like You
