Well ya know when you're young,  
There's such a distance between you and your family.  
Just can't see things from the same point of view.  
  
Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author,  
And all you want is for them to want you.  
  
Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east
coast.  
And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close.  
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast.  
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most.  
And california, she's an angel.  
Lo, so heavenly dressed  
And the pacific she's a woman  
The lord must have loved her best.  
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest  
And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test  
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes for his own kid.  
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime  
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids  
I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds  
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding.  
And my father he once held me close by crying.  
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing.  
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling.  
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,  
Gotta see hen on sunday when she's dressed  
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best.  
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest.  
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test.
