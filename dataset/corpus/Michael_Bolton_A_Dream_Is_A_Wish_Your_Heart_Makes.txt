A dream is a wish your heart makes  
When you're fast asleep  
In dreams you will lose your heartaches  
Whatever you wish for you keep  
Have faith in your dreams and some day  
Your rainbow will come smilin' through  
No matter how your heart is grievin', if you keep on believin'  
The dream that you wish will come true  
Have faith in your dreams and someday  
Your rainbow will come smilin' through  
No matter how your heart is grievin', if you keep on believin'  
The dream that you wish will come true
