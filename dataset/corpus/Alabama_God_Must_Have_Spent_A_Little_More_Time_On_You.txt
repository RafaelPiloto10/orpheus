Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?  
  
How can I put into words what I feel?  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?  
Never knew that love could feel like this,  
And you changed my world with just one kiss.  
How can it be that right here with me there's an angel?  
It's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than any diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
And I'm trying hard to figure out just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside, leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
Never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you change my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, is just a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
God must have spent a little more time on you
