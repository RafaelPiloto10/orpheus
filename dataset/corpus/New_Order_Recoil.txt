[Verse:]  
You've got a strange look in your eyes  
Nothing to get and no need to lie.  
And when the dust come howl at your door  
You're not afraid, it's just the role.  
  
It's not the way that I want to be  
But I can't explain just how I feel.  
Out of my heart and into my soul  
You were the start and you are the go.  
  
But it isn't funny the way that you talk about me  
You know I can't change the way that you want me to be.  
But I tried to do what I can, gone is the life we built in a sec.
