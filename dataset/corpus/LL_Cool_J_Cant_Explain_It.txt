Yeah, uh-huh  
Uh-huh, I can't explain it  
  
You know it's that moment  
It's just that moment  
Y'knahmsayin? I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't explain it  
My love when we're together  
You're the greatest, nobody does it better  
When you hold me  
I wish that I could be your, one and only  
Nobody does it better  
  
I understand you want canaries on your hand  
Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band  
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand  
You don't want to make it happen unless it's the right man  
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me  
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me  
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender  
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender  
Let me kiss your eyes  
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe  
I pull back to stare at your eyes  
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized  
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile  
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style  
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while  
Let's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle  
I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Straight up, you beautiful b  
I don't think you understand what you doin' to me  
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin' TV  
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin' me  
uh then we kiss for real  
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel  
You go to the bathroom for a second  
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)  
That's when you come back and walk to me slow  
That's when you change up and let it all flow  
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow  
I love to take my time, love to give you a show  
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below  
Use my ears like handlebars, take control  
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role  
Baby relax, let me touch your soul  
I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks  
with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)  
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch  
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch  
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean  
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen  
You the 6 I needed you like a fix  
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click  
I pick up the pace  
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face  
I look at your lips and take a taste  
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist  
We whylin' out, we all over the place  
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace  
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith  
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]
