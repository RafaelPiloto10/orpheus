What do you want to hear when we're making love  
What do you want to hear when we're making love  
Can I take you from behind and hold you in my arms  
What do you want to hear when we're making love  
  
Can I take you from behind and feel you in my heart  
What do we need to re-live to bring us close  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me  
  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me  
Four fall in a bed, three giving head, one getting wet  
Four fall in a bed, three giving head, one getting wet  
  
What do you want to hear when we're making love  
Can I hold you from behind and tell you that it's me  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me  
  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me  
The love drug is a bug that cuts us both up  
Why don't you do those things to me  
  
Why don't you do it of me, why don't you do those things to me  
What can I say to you when we're making love  
I could take you from behind and make you live  
What do you need me to say when we're making love  
  
I can take you from behind and then I'll forgive  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me  
Why don't you do it to me  
Why don't you do those things to me
