Let's get going all you foreign  
No complaining only moaning  
  
Dominicans, Puerto Rican, you know they do it for me  
See me in a Ferrari where my where my madder thing is from  
If it has some wings, we'd be flying, we'd be soaring  
Ah-ah-ah  
When I'm in it I'll be thinking I don't want this thing to stop  
No-o-o  
But I'm thinking that you're winning if you make it to the top  
That probably means you make me feel some type of way
