A modest man from mandrake  
Travelled rich to the city  
He had a need to discover  
A use for his newly-found wealth  
  
Because he was human  
Because he had goodness  
Because he was moral  
They called him insane  
  
Delusions of grandeur  
Visions of splendour  
A manic depressive  
He walks in the rain  
  
Eyes wide open  
Heart undefended  
Innocence untarnished  
  
Cinderella man  
Doing what you can  
They can't understand  
What it means  
  
Cinderella man  
Hang on to your plans  
Try as they might  
They cannot steal your dreams  
  
In the betrayal of his love he awakened  
To face a world of cold reality  
And a look in the eyes of the hungry  
Awakened him to what he could do  
  
He held up his riches  
To challenge the hungry  
Purposeful motion  
For one so insane  
  
They tried to fight him  
Just couldn't beat him  
This manic depressive  
Who walks in the rain
