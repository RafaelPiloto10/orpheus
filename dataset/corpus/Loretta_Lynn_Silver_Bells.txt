Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city  
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day  
City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells silver bells...  
  
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells)  
Silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day
