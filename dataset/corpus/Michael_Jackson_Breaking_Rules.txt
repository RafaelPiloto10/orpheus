Sony's out here tellin the world it's Michael Jackson  
They're out here sellin this song as Michael Jackson  
Just when you thought it was wrong they go and do it again  
Pushin this around the world today  
You know that He wouldn't want it this way  
  
No matter what you just gotta hear it again  
Sony's curupt and you know it's about money  
  
It isn't strange if Sony wrote this song  
Cause it's not Michael and you know it's wrong  
I don't know what the Hell they're thinkin of  
But they're Breakin Rules, they're Breakin Rules  
  
Everybody knows that this song ain't Michael Jackson  
They're out here killing the love of Michael Jackson  
Just when you thought it was done now it's a weapon  
You turn your back on His love  
And sell a Phony as Him  
  
No matter what you just wanna hear it again  
Sony's curupt and you know it's about money
