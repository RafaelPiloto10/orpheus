There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
You make me feel like no one else before  
You make me wonder how easy it is to love  
You make me wonder how easy it is to love  
  
There's something special about a kiss  
It makes me want no other lover  
'Cause you make me feel like this  
When you're away I want no other  
  
I never found what I was looking for  
I got to wonder if no star would ever shine  
I can't explain it, but somehow deep inside  
I always knew that when it did I'd recognise you  
  
There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
Now I know what I've been doing here  
Now I know what it's all about  
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be  
In your arms is where I always want to be, 'cause  
  
There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
There's something special about you  
There's something special about a kiss  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
There's something special about you  
There's something special about a kiss  
'Cause you make me feel like this  
  
Something special  
Something special  
Special
