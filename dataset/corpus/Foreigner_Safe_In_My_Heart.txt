In this world, life can be hard on a sensitive girl  
Who do you turn to, when you really need someone  
Don't give in, hold on, and in time  
The day will come, and you will know  
That your life has only just begun  
And you will feel love, you'll feel the earth meet the heavens above  
Leave the past behind, now is the time  
Put your trust in me, and believe, when I tell you  
I want you, close to me  
And from now until the end of time  
You'll be safe, safe in my heart, so safe, you know you are  
In this space, in this heart  
There will always be a place for you  
Safe in my heart  
From now on, girl I'll be there, I'll be strong for you  
When you need me, I'll be right here by your side  
Put your trust in me and believe when I tell you  
I need you, close to me  
From now, 'till the end of time, I want you to know  
You are safe, in my heart, so safe, you know you are  
In this space, in this heart  
There's no room, for anyone but you  
I would cry for you, even die for you  
So just listen and remember, there will always be a place  
For you  
Safe in my heart
