Everybody go round, go round, go round  
Everybody lay down, lay down, lay down  
Don't nobody make a sound  
Everybody lay down  
Everybody give up, give up, give up  
Nobody hang tough, hang tough, hang tough  
Life a little too rough  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody say hey, Don't nobody say no?  
Everybody say wait, Don't nobody say go? (CHORUS)  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody cry loud, cry loud, cry loud  
Nobody too proud, too proud, too proud  
To tell you what they're all about  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody don't care, don't care, don't care  
Nobody play fair, play fair, play fair  
Maybe everybody too scared  
Everybody lay down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody lookin' higher  
Everybody want to touch the fire  
Nobody willing to lay it all down  
  
Everybody want heaven  
Everybody say Amen  
One thing is certain, you gotta lay it all down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody go round, go round, go  
Everybody lay down, lay down  
Don't nobody make a sound  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody give up, give up, give up  
Nobody hang tough, hang tough  
When it's just a little rough, everybody lay down  
  
[Chorus: x2]
