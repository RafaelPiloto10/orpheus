Much too long I've been a prisoner here  
The hour has come to break out  
Shackled and chained almost goin' insane  
It's better to live on the run  
Set me free, set me free  
  
Send me a sign, want to leave it all behind  
I'll be leaving the hands of doom  
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands  
To be free and not trapped anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Ride the sky, Ride the sky  
Give me wings to fly, Ride the sky  
  
I have to think for myself and then act  
In conformity of my own thoughts  
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right  
Why don't you leave me alone  
Set me free, set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
