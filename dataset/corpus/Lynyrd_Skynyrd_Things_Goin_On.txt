Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow?  
Well, if you don't know what I mean  
Won't you stand up and scream?  
'Cause there's things goin' on that you don't know  
  
Too many lives they've spent across the ocean  
Too much money been spent upon the moon  
Well, until they make it right  
I hope they never sleep at night  
They better make some changes  
And do it soon  
  
Well, they're goin ruin the air we breathe  
Lord have mercy  
They're gonna ruin us all, by and by  
I'm telling all you beware  
I don't think they really care  
I think they just sit up there  
And just get high  
  
Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow?  
Well, if you don't know what I mean  
Won't you stand up and scream?  
'Cause there's things goin' on that you don't know  
  
Well, if you don't know what I mean  
Won't you stand up and scream?  
'Cause there's things goin' on that you don't know  
  
Thing goin' on
