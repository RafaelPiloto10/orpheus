One mornin' when I was ridin'  
In my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin' down  
My eyes caught the color  
As it lead me down the road  
Dippin' and bobbin' in the sun  
I've never seen that blue before  
'Cept in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
So I followed all the way  
To the top of the hill  
That's where she kept on climbin' lord  
Someday I will  
  
[Chorus]  
Beautiful bluebird  
See how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window  
Where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird  
I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Well it kind of struck me funny  
Sort of made me smile  
After all these years on this old road  
How God could show me somethin'  
Never say a word  
There's so much that I don't know  
I've never seen that blue before  
Except in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
I followed all the way to the top of the hill  
That's where she kept on climbin' lord  
And someday I will  
  
[Chorus: x2]
