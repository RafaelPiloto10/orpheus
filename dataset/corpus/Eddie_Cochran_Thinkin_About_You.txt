Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Hopin' that you love me too  
I went to see a movie, I was feelin' blue  
When I looked at my ticket, I bought seats for two  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Hopin' that you love me too  
I was gettin' hungry, some popcorn would do  
When the girl asked me how many, I quickly answered two  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Hopin' that you love me too  
  
I left the movies early, still feelin' blue  
But when I went to bed, I still had on my shoes  
'Cause I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Hopin' that you love me too
