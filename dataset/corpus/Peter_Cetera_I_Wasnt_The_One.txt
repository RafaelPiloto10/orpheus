Your eyes and my eyes haven't talked in quite a while  
Seems like a lifetime since I walked beside your smile  
There's a dark cloud that's hanging above  
Memories never lie  
Still we talk about the way that it was  
And I think we both know the feeling hasn't died  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try  
Da da  
  
Your touch and my touch haven't spoken for some time  
You say we've both changed and your always on my mind  
I can tell you that it's over and done but I would only lose  
Being close to the want that I want  
So go on and ask me if I'm still in love with you  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try  
Da da  
  
There was no need for you to ask - please don't ask  
You oughta know by now, ooo babe, I want you back  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night
