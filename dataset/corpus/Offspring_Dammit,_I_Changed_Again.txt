Hey come inside  
While I stand here acting bored  
(Yes I feel this way)  
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I turn around  
Things have changed  
Now I don't feel the same, yeah  
Start a fight, kick a fit  
One more time  
Dammit, I changed again  
  
Now I don't see things  
The way I did before  
Things I feel today  
Just don't matter anymore  
It doesn't make any sense  
To feel so different everyday  
(Yes I feel this way)  
When nothing's changed except for  
  
Next time I...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Next time I turn around  
Things have changed  
Now I don't feel the same, yeah  
Start a fight, kick a fit  
One more time  
Dammit, I changed again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see it
