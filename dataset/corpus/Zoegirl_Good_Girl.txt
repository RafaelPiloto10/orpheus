You walk a narrow road  
I know you face it on your own  
But you've got the will inside  
I can see it in your eyes  
You're not about mini skirts  
And silly reasons just to flirt  
Cause you've got heaven on your side  
And that's how you live your life  
  
Hang on, good girl, you're not the only one  
Be strong, good girl, when the pressure comes  
When they try to bring you down  
You'll be glad you stood your ground  
So just hang on  
  
You've seen a lot of things  
You're the keeper of many dreams  
You've got everything it takes  
To stay strong, carry on  
You're sick of childish games  
You speak the truth and you say it straight  
And when your dreams have been delayed  
You've got the strength to wait  
So keep on waiting  
  
You're not sugar and spice and everything nice  
You've got character and you paid the price  
You're not after self-perfection  
You're living out your redemption  
What sets you apart from everyone else  
Is that you know your savior and you know him well  
What makes you different from all the rest  
Is that you won't let it get to you
