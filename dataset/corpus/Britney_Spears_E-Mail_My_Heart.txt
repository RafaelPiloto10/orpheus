Forever...  
It's been hours  
Seems like days  
Since you went away  
  
And all I do is check the screen  
To see if you're okay  
You don't answer when I phone  
Guess you want to be left alone  
  
So I'm sending you my heart my soul  
And this is what I'll say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm sorry  
Oh so sorry  
Can't you give me one more chance  
To make it all up to you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
E-mail my heart  
And say our love will never die (and I)  
I know you're out there  
And I know that you still care (I know you care)  
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive  
Forever...e-mail my heart  
  
I can see you in my mind  
Coming on the line  
And opening this letter  
That I've sent a hundred times  
  
Here's a picture of us two (us two)  
I look so good on you (on you)  
And can't you please forgive me  
For the hurt I put you through  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forever... e-mail my  
Forever... e-mail my heart
