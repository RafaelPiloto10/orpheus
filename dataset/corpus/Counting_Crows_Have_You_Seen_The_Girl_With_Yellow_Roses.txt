She was only seventeen and I was twenty-one  
Chasing dreams we left Topeka following the sun  
We were kids still growing up with rainbows in our mind  
So off we went into the world not knowing what we'd find  
The first few days were filled with fun and laughing her and I  
We'd stop from place to place to try the good times on for size  
She always wore a yellow rose to show her love for me  
A yellow rose so everyone could see  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
She's as pretty as could be  
She always wears a yellow rose so everyone can see  
She always wears a yellow rose for me  
Now the days have past so quickly and the living got so rough  
Suddenly we found we couldn't live just on our love  
Just two kids alone with thought of Kansas in our mind  
Thinking of the families loving arms we left behind  
Of each new day I found that we grew more and more apart  
Though she tried to cling to me with love still in her heart  
Then one day I hurt her like a fool I made her cry  
I noticed that the yellow rose had died  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
Help me find her won't you please  
She always wore a yellow rose so everyone could see  
She always wore a yellow rose for me
