Hurry on down to my house, honey,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby.  
Oh, I'm blue as I can be.  
I love you. You love me.  
A-hurry through the alley  
So the neighbors don't see.  
Hurry on down to my house, honey,  
Ain't nobody home but me. Oh.  
  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby.  
I'm blue as I can be.  
  
Oh, blue when the clock a-went  
Tick-tock-tick.  
Ooh, c'mon, honey, quick, quick, quick.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
  
Say, hurry, hurry, a-nobody's home.  
Hurry on down, baby,  
I'm blue as I can be.  
Oh, please come down  
Just as soon as you can.  
If you don't come down,  
I got to call Sam!  
You know the man is crazy about me.  
Ain't nobody home but me . . . ow!  
  
"Well, what's goin' on with the three of yous? c'mon, c'mon, make it snappy.

Nobody's home!"  
  
Say, hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home.  
Haul it down, drag it down,  
Any way to get it down.  
I'm blue as I can be.  
Ashes-to-ashes. Dust-to-dust.  
C'mon, honey, you must, you must!  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
  
Hurry, hurry. A-nobody's home.  
Haul it down and drag it down.  
You know I can't stand to be alone.  
Operator, get me hillside, 409.  
A-don't stop ringin'  
'til you get that baby's line!  
He's gonna haul it down!  
Ain't nobody home but, you believe it,  
There's nobody home but me! Wo!
