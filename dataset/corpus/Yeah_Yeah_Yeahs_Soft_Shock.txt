Unknown, talk to unknown  
Ever, lasts forever  
Well it's a shock, shock to your soft side  
Summer moon  
Catch your shut eyes in your room  
In my room  
In your room  
In my room  
  
Louder, lips speak louder  
Better, back together  
Still it's a shock, shock to your soft side  
Summer moon  
Catch your shut eyes in my room  
In your room  
In my room  
In your room  
  
Whats the time  
Whats the day  
Go and leave me  
Whats the time [Repeat x2]  
Whats the place  
Go and leave me  
  
Out,  
  
Leave me out [Repeat x3]
