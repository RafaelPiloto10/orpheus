She said she always loved this time of year  
And how they used to celebrate when he was here  
Then he went away and nothing more to say  
He's not coming home  
She's gonna be alone for the holidays  
She wrote down every word in her diary  
She reads it now and then  
To remind her of how it used to be  
He's not here today, there's nothing more to say  
He's not coming home  
She's gonna be alone for the holidays  
She cries all night on Christmas Eve  
She just gets by on Christmas day  
She's lost her will but kept her faith  
But he's not coming home  
She's gonna be alone for the holidays  
She cries all night on New Year's Eve  
She just gets by on New Year's Day  
She's lost her will but kept her faith  
He's never coming home  
She's gonna be alone alone for the holidays
