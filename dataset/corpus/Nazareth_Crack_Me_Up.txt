Hello, feelin' happy, got peace of mind?  
Hello, kimosabe, won't you be so kind  
Tell all the fake facts jack, dirt n all  
How long'd it take you mac, t'get the skirt to fall?  
Hello Mr. backstreet president, hello, how's it hangin'  
Still shakin' her tent? don't it hurt, what she's sayin'?  
'Bout you to your back, don't it bother you at all?  
  
You know you crack me up, really, really crack me up  
  
Well hello, (hello) it's a real bad line, just want the  
Love of a good, good woman sometime  
Sold to the man who has everything  
Gold-caged Madonna, sing mama, sing  
Come on, get close, I forget how near  
Move along now,  
There's nothin' to see round here  
Can' you care about me, like I care about me?  
Don't it bother you at all?  
  
You know you crack me up, really, really crack me up  
You crack me up, crack me up  
  
Happy, feelin' happy, got peace of mind?
