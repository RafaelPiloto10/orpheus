From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain  
We were drinking beauty with our eyes  
We were given all to make our own  
Let us be left alone  
  
Laid the tasks and paid the price  
Everything survives  
Crushed and bolted all the grain  
At every wind what a stake we're in  
Is pain better than the grave  
  
When we talk without amend  
We see red and then  
Deep inside our blood begins to boil  
Like a tiger in the cage  
We begin to shake with rage
