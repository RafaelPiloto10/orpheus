It's never been the same since you returned from dreamin'  
With your nursery rhyme excuses your picture postcards gleamin'  
Tellin' everyone who looks your way 'bout people and their sinnin'  
While you left field verse is fallin' in proportion to your winnin'  
And I can't be your hero today  
I'm through with the simple games you play  
It just may take some time for me to even up the score  
But I can't be your soldier home from war  
And there you sit shouting that there's still hope for us  
While nature holds the handcuffs on a capricorn and taurus  
There's nothing you can do or say to get me to your camp  
Go fill up all your savings books and buy yourself a lamp  
And I can't be your hero today  
Your wholesale price is much to high to pay  
A bargain basement atmosphere is no way to sell love  
And I can't be your superman above  
No I can't be your hero today  
That is all I really want to say  
Go find a leading man who wants to play  
And I can't be your hero today
