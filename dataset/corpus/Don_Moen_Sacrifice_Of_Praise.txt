How can I say thanks  
For everything You've done  
And how can I give praise  
Lord You've given me so much  
You gave it all  
You paid the price  
Now I want to give You my life  
  
Chorus:  
As a sacrifice of praise  
O lift it up to You  
Lord I give my heart away  
O I give it all to you  
Lord make my life an offering  
Let me worship You in everything I do  
  
A sacrifice of praise I give to You  
  
In sunshine and in rain  
In sorrow and in pain  
Lord I will give You praise  
And choose to bless Your name  
You gave it all  
And You paid the price  
Now I want to give You my life  
  
Lord I want to lift You up  
Lord I want to lift You up
