Wannabe a member, wannabe a name  
Wannabe a local face that plays the social games  
Dancing through a time will bring you dinosaur trends  
The limits of your mind is where the county line ends  
Listen to the media present it all as fact  
Following the lead cause you don't know how to act  
Travel in a straight line cause you don't know your own way  
They'll get you in the end before you know you'll have a say  
  
This O. C. Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world, trade your happy thoughts  
O. C. Life is not the life so free  
... For you girls and boys  
  
Wannabe a member, wanna have some fame  
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game  
Atm and starbucks (on) every corner are the norm  
Environment so sterile, it'll get you to conform  
714, wear it like a brand  
Contaminated future is [...]  
Fight all their rules, I don't see a better way  
Guess you're really in before you know you'll have a say  
  
This O. C. Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world, riot out your thoughts  
O. C. Life is not the life so free  
Pressure is for real, with artificial joys  
... For you girls and boys  
  
Check you out  
You're all [...] fiend
