You cut me deep,  
But now I'm gonna see you weep, yeah  
This broken man  
Is gonna do the best he can, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
You played with me like a toy  
And a little baby  
After I broke  
You just didn't want to know, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
My time will come,  
And you'll know when it's begun, yeah  
  
You'll know because  
You're gonna be just where I was, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away
