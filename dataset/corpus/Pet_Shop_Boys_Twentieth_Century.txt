Oh, I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
That I don't think we can just dismiss  
After one hundred years  
Of inhumanity  
The lesson that I learned was this:  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Well I bought a ticket  
To the revolution  
And I cheered when the statues fell  
Everyone came  
To destroy what was rotten  
But they killed off what was good as well  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Stay with me  
This century  
Together we're better  
  
Oh, I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
It may seem somewhat hit or miss  
If you've certainty  
'Bout the way it's all meant to be  
The lesson that you need is this:  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together
