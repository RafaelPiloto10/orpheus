I'm just a bachelor, I'm lookin' for a partner  
Someone who knows how to ride without even fallin' off  
Gotta be compatible takes me to my limits  
Girl when I break you off, I promise that you won't wanna get off  
  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
  
Sittin' here flossin', peepin' your steelo  
Just once if I have the chance, the things I would do to you  
You and your body, every single portion  
Send chills up and down your spine, juices flowin' down your thigh  
  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
  
If we're gonna get nasty baby  
First we'll show and tell  
Till I reach your pony tail  
(Oh)  
Lurk all over and through you baby  
Until we reach the stream  
You'll be on my jockey team  
(Ooh)  
  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
  
If you're horny, let's do it  
Ride it, my pony  
My saddle's waitin'  
Come and jump on it  
  
Ride it  
Ride it
