Once upon a lifetime  
I looked in someone's eyes  
And felt the fire burning in my heart  
For the very first time  
She was scared and young  
And had never tasted love  
So I took her by the hand  
And a boy became a man  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
And once upon a lifetime  
You hold the Queen of Hearts  
And if you gamble on a diamond win  
The dealin' starts  
  
You stand to lose it all  
As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
And people only find love like yours and mine  
Once upon a lifetime
