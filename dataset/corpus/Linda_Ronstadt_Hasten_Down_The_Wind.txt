She tells him she thinks she wants to be free  
He tells her he doesn't understand  
She takes his hand  
And tells him nothing's working out the way she planned  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
He's hanging on to half a heart  
But he can't have the restless part  
  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
Now he agrees he thinks she ought to be free  
Now she says she'd rather be with him  
Oh it's just a whim  
  
That she's designed to keep him out there on that limb  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
He hanging on to half a heart  
  
But he can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
He tells her to hasten down the wind  
He tells her to hasten down the wind
