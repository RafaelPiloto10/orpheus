Here we go, 2.. 1, 2, 3!  
  
I want a woman like Marilyn Monroe  
The kind of woman that'd never say no  
The kind of woman that'd make you scream  
"That's the girl o' my dreams!"  
  
I want a woman that'll treat me right  
Give me good lovin' all through the night  
Take her on a date, she's my machine  
That's the girl o' my dreams  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the girl o' my dreams  
Oh, listen people, that's the girl o' my dreams  
  
I want a woman like Lauren Bacall  
Old and wrinkled but knows it all  
Got all the little tricks that'll make me cream  
That's the girl o' my dreams  
  
I want a woman that'll wash my hair  
Even wash my underwear  
Always smilin', never mean  
That's the girl o' my dreams  
  
Chorus  
  
I would say that U're a chauvinist  
  
No, I just got a lot of things that are on my list!  
  
Yeah, if she couldn't hang, would you give her the fist?  
  
No man, I'd sit her right down and give her a little kiss!  
  
Oh, I need a woman like Lena Horne  
Knowed she was funky since the day she was born  
Lena's mama say "Doc, is it a girl?"  
Doc say "And how!"  
Lena smiled, slapped the doctor and said  
"Sucker I'm runnin' things now!"  
  
Chorus
