To be the last to leave...  
The last to be gone  
Stolen from the ones  
Who held onto him  
To be the last in line  
From the ones that live on  
Silhouette of a dream  
Treasured by the ones  
Who held on to him  
Almost a breakdown  
Of our love affair...  
The stiletto cuts quick  
Like a whip through the air  
Long distance winners  
Will we survive the flight  
Not one of us runs  
From the firelight  
And I would love to believe  
I believe what you say  
But in the drama of the moment  
Oh well there is no easy way  
No-one ever leaves  
Everyone stays close 'til the fire fades  
To be the last to leave  
Well, what caused the fearsome  
Divorce in the night  
When there was no competition  
Well to survive, do it right  
And you can believe in the five  
To survive the distance  
Everyone fights...everyone fights....  
And the fire flies  
Well what happened to my feelings....  
There were angry words in the night  
Some call it our nightmare  
My five fireflies  
Oh like a sailing ship...  
But not one of us runs..  
OOooohhh -why...  
It's our love affair  
It cuts like a whip through the air  
And I would love to believe  
To believe what you say  
It's ok..........
