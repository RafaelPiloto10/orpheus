All alone in my room think of you at a rate that is truly alarming  
I keep grouping my memories of you in my head, I pretend that you want me  
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities  
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about your love  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go  
I was wrestling with you in my dreams, and wake up making love to a pillow  
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities  
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And you never go on till I do  
And I can't stop, and I can't stop  
  
What I would give to have you look in my direction  
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention  
And I touch myself like it's somebody else  
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind  
Let me show you  
  
I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about you
