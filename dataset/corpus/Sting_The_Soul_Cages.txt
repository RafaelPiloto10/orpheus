The boy child is locked in the fisherman's yard  
There's a bloodless moon where the oceans die  
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets  
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie  
  
Where is the fisherman where is the goat?  
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat?  
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies  
Where is the child with his father's eyes?  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
He's the king of the ninth world  
The twisted son of the fog bells toll  
In each and every lobster cage  
A tortured human soul  
  
These are the souls of the broken factories  
The subject slaves of the broken crown  
The dead accounting of old guilty promises  
These are the souls of the broken town  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
'I have a wager' the brave child spoke  
The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke.  
'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me  
And if the drink leaves me standing,  
A soul shall go free'  
  
'I have here a cask of most magical wine  
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line  
It's wrung from the blood of the sailors who died  
Young white body adrift in the tide'  
  
'And what's in it for me my pretty young thing?  
Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings?  
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea  
You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me'  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
A body lies open in the fisherman's yard  
Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips  
One less soul in the soul cages  
One last curse on the fisherman's lips  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
Swim to the light  
Swim to the light  
  
He dreamed of the ship on the sea  
It would carry his father and he  
To a place they could never be found  
To a place far away from this town  
A Newcastle ship without coals  
They would sail to the island of souls
