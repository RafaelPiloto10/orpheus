I remember the day I called mama on the telephone  
I told her mama I'm getting married  
I could hear her voice on the other side of the telephone she was smiling  
And she asked me a question that I proudly answered  
She said son did you take time to know her  
I said mama she's the best  
But today it hurts me so  
To go back to mama and say mama I  
'm getting divorced  
Oh I'm getting divorced  
  
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would (x2) it hurts me
so mama  
mama said to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's not easy to understand it son  
But I hope you'll make it (x3)  
You'll be happy again  
  
I remember in church  
When the preacher read the scriptures  
You looked so beautiful and innocent  
I did not know that behind that beauty  
Lies the true colors that will destroy me in the near future  
  
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would be (x2)  
Now I'm hurting  
  
I remember when I held you  
By the hand preacher man read the scriptures  
Putting words in you mouth  
  
Maybe what the preacher man said was not something that was with you  
Now I know what they mean when they say  
  
Beautiful woman is another man's plaything  
Oh Lord I'm hurting now  
  
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would  
Mama said to me  
  
[Chorus:] (till fade) It's not easy...
