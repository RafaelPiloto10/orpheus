Show me where you keep all your secrets upstairs  
Night after night you sleep while they're setting off flares Someone came and
took all the roses away  
Now you'll sit showing me tears if you want me to stay  
Cause down the street all the meters have run out of time, run out of time I
waited for you as the trees swayed out of time  
In a crowded room I pick up your lonely stare  
I'll cover for you like a slipcover covers a chair  
But someone came and took all the roses away  
It was only 5 minutes but it felt like it stretched into a day  
Someone came and took all the roses away
