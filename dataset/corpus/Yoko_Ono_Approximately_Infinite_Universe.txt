In this approximately infinite universe,  
I know a girl who's in constant hell.  
No love or pill could keep her cool,  
'Cause there's a thousand holes in her heart.  
  
And the wind of the past blows through her heart,  
Reminding her of the people she killed.  
Wind of now blows off her cool,  
Telling her there's something she's missed.  
  
You know the town of Sapporo, she says,  
Where the men talk rough and never sing.  
Two bottles of loneliness  
Patching the holes in her dream.  
  
In this approximately infinite universe,  
I know a girl who's raising constant hell.  
No love or bottle could fix her good,  
'Cause there's a thousand holes in her head.  
  
And the wind of the future blows through her head,  
Saying there's no point of return.  
The wind of the universe blows off her soul,  
Telling her there's nowhere to go.  
  
I wanna sleep, wanna sleep, she says,  
And take her fix to bed.  
Two bottles of loneliness  
Patching the holes in her dream.
