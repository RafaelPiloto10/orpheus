Ten fingers we have each  
Nine planets around the sun repeat  
Eight ball is the last if you triumphant be  
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea  
It's a typical situation  
In the typical times  
Too many choices  
Everybody's happy  
Everybody's free  
We'll keep the big door open  
Everyone'll come around  
Why are you different  
Why are you that way  
If you don't get in line  
We'll lock you away  
It all comes down to nothing  
Six senses feeling  
Five around a sense of self  
Four season turn on and turn off  
I can see  
Three corners from this corner  
Two is a perfect number  
But one  
Everybody's happy  
Everybody's free  
We'll keep the big door open  
And everyone'll come around  
Why are you different  
Why are you that way  
If you don't step in line  
We'll lock you away  
It's a typical situation  
In these typical times  
We can't do thing about it
