I just wanna be lost  
In a crowded room  
So I don't have to hear  
Your point of view  
You know I don't care  
About what you say  
And it's the way  
You say it, too  
  
So why did you come to me  
When you knew mat you didn't believe  
What did you expect to get from telling me  
You don't understand  
Anything or how I am  
I just wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
I wanna be loved  
Aaaaaaaahh  
  
I just want to stay  
Or way from me  
With all your lies  
I just don't believe  
  
So why did you come to me  
When you knew mat you didn't believe  
What did you expect to get from telling me  
You don't understand  
Anything or how I am  
I just wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
I wanna be loved  
Aaaaaaaahh  
  
You don't understand  
You don't understand  
You don't understand  
I just wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
I wanna be loved  
Aaaaaaaaaahhh
