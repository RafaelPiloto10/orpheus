In modern music some clever guy has started a brand new craze  
A fellow must put Do De O Do into all he sings or plays  
Now some may think this foolish but I'm not one of those  
For I attach importance to those Do De O Do, Do De O Do's  
Now you can't be rich you're poor instead  
Without the Do De O, Do De O Do  
You can't make cakes and you can't make bread  
Without the Do De O, Do De O Do  
You need it in your music, as any child will know  
The Re, Me, Fah. So, La's alright but what about the Do De O Do  
Now we take these champion boxers, there's a lot that we all know  
Who fall on the ground in the second round to get the Do De O De O De O Do  
To get the Do De O De O De O Do  
Now you can't be rich you're poor instead  
Without the Do De O, Do De O, Do  
You can't make cakes and you can't make bread  
Without the Do De O, Do De O, Do  
You even need it in your music, as any little child will know  
The Re, Me, Fah. So, La's alright but what about the Do De O Do  
Now suppose your keeping rabbits, you've a buck well may be so  
How can he raise a family without the Do De O De O De O Do  
Without the Do De O De O De O Do
