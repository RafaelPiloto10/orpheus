Lately  
I find myself out gazin' at stars,  
Hearing guitars,  
Like someone in love  
  
Sometimes  
The things I do astound me,  
Mostly  
Whenever you're around me  
  
Lately  
I seem to walk, as though I had wings,  
Bump into things,  
Like someone in love  
  
Each time I look at you,  
I'm limp as a glove,  
An' feelin' like someone in love  
  
I bump into things,  
Like someone in love  
  
Each time I look at you,  
I'm limp as a glove,  
An' feelin' like someone in love
