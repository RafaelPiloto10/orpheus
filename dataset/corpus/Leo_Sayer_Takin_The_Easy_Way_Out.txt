You contend  
That you'll never got back to her again  
You're as free as a night without end  
So you tell your friends  
  
Just what you had to endure  
When you told her never, never again  
And as the room about you starts to bend  
You pretend  
  
That you've taken the easy way out  
Though you know ehn you told her last night  
You were fakin' the easy way out  
With one hand reachin' fo the door  
  
But your feet weren't movin'  
They were nailed to the floor  
As she told you once more  
There's no easy way to get out  
  
She's not like you  
She'd rather stay at home  
'n' not get the blues  
And if you ever do try to intrude  
  
She's so respectfully rude  
So it was hard to believe  
Last night while you were drunk 'n'  
Threatening to leave  
  
That she walked through the door with such ease  
'n' threw you the key  
And she's takin' the easy way out  
And you're alone with no number to call  
  
She's taken the easy way out  
With one hand reachin' for the door  
And you so speechless  
Marooned on the floor  
  
She walked out of your life  
Couldn't stand it no more  
Now you're all on your own  
'Cause she's taken the easy way out  
  
You know she's taken the easy way out  
Oh, but your pride will only admit to a lie  
Yeah, she's taken the easy way out  
But, to your friends  
  
You're the hero of the night  
Drowning with beef all the tears in your eyes  
Hopin' it don't show that you're dyin' inside  
'Cause you can't quite believe  
  
That she's taken the easy way out  
There's no goin' back now  
Stuck here on your own  
Lookin' for a home  
  
Drunk and on the streets  
Stuck on your feet
