A long long time ago  
I can still remember  
How that music used to make me smile  
And I knew that if I had one chance  
I could make those people dance  
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile  
  
Did you write the book of love  
And do you have faith in God above  
If the bible tells you so  
Now do you believe in rock n roll  
And can music save your mortal soul  
And can it teach me how to dance real slow  
Well I know that your in love with him  
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym  
You both kicked off your shoes  
And I did Gods rhythm and blues  
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck  
With a great carnation and a pick up truck  
But I knew that I was out of luck  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
I met a girl who sang the blues  
And I asked her for some happy news  
But she just smiled and turned away  
Well I went down to the sachet store  
Where I heard the music years before  
But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
Well now in the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
But not a word was spoken  
The church bells all broken  
And the three men I admire the most,  
The father, son, and the holy ghost  
They caught the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
We started singing  
We started singing  
We started singing  
We started singing
