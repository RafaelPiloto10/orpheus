I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
In a smokey night cafe, all the guys are so happy  
Baby I can see  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Thinking of you, girl, all this sweet sweet memories  
We built a better world  
When will I see you again, baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me, my sweet baby  
I won't cry for yesterday, baby come and hear me say  
Tell me, do I have a chance, my love?  
  
I will run to you, I will kiss the rain  
Make your dreams come true, if I have you back again  
I will run to you, everyday and night  
Give you all my heart, want to have you by my side  
  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Catch a falling star, when you're there the sky is bluer  
But you are so far  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Can't trust your pretty face, maybe you were telling lies  
I saw you in this place  
When will I see you again, baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me, my sweet baby  
I won't cry for yesterday, baby come and make my day  
Tell me do I have a chance, my love
