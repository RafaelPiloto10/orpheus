A-Tisket A-Tasket  
A green and yellow basket  
I bought a basket for my mommie  
On the way I dropped it  
I dropped it, I dropped it  
Yes on the way I dropped it  
A little girlie picked it up  
And took it to the market  
She was truckin' on down the  
Avenue without a single thing to do  
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around  
When she spied it on the ground  
A-Tisket A-Tasket  
She took my yellow basket  
And if she doesn't bring it back  
I think that I shall die  
(Was it red?)  
No, no, no, no  
(Was it brown?)  
No, no, no, no  
(Was it blue)  
No, no, no, no  
Just a little yellow basket
