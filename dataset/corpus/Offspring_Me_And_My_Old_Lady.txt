Me And My Old Lady  
Lay in bed all day  
And when I say I love her  
Well she rolls the other way  
But really she don't mean it  
Everything she says  
Still if I believe in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with my head  
Me and my old lady  
Sit and sip on wine  
And when she says she loves me  
Will I say that love is blind  
But really I don't mean it  
Everything I say  
Still if she believes in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with her head  
So what if we're making a scene now  
You know she don't give a shit  
When she's pawin' and grabbin' on me now  
You know I don't mind a bit  
It's all good and we  
Ain't gonna change now  
The world is unaware  
So if you want, go on and stare  
Cause we don't care  
She ain't no ball and chain  
Me and my old lady  
Suck each other dry  
And when in that position  
I'm the luckiest man alive  
Quenching our libidos  
Passing time away  
Now that we believe in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with our head
