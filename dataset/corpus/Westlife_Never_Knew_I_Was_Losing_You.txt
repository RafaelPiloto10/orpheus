Mark:  
I'm feeling so alone now tonight  
Even though you're here by my side  
Is there something on your mind  
From the world you'd left behind  
  
I feel as if the loved shared before  
Doesn't want to be here no more  
And if there's something on your mind  
There's never been a better time  
To tell me  
  
Bryan:  
Do you love me  
Still wanting me  
Like I need you, oh  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
But I never knew I was losing you  
  
Nicky:  
I wonder as you walk through the door  
Are you gonna hurt me some more  
Never took you for the kind  
Who would play up on my mind  
  
Bryan:  
Tell me what are you looking for  
I can't play your games anymore  
And when there's something on my mind  
I will always find the time  
To tell you  
  
I still love you  
Still wanting you  
How I need you, oh  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you  
  
Bryan:  
It's not for the first time  
That someone else has hurt me  
By faking it too long  
Where did we go wrong, yeah  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you
