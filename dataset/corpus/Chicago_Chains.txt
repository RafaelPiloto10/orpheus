I don't want any trouble  
I don't want to make any waves  
I don't want any conscience  
And I don't wanna be brave  
I've kept my distance  
My feelings have never been shown  
I know that I've been walking fences  
Denied what I have known  
And I carry chains  
(I carry chains)  
Heavy, heavy chains  
(Chains that are made)  
I carry chains 'round my feet  
(I carry chains)  
I feel the weight  
(I feel the weight)  
Chains are the different things  
That should not be hanging on me  
I put my conscience under a stone  
The stone under the ground  
Walked from where I had left it  
I hoped it couldn't be found  
My conscience persisted  
It's a haunted seed I have sown  
Calls me out from the distance  
And it just won't leave me alone  
And I carry chains  
(I carry chains)  
Chains that are made  
(Chains that are made)  
I carry heavy chains  
(I carry chains)  
Talk about the weight  
(I feel the weight)  
I carry chains  
(I carry chains)  
You know I feel the weight  
(Chains that are made)  
I feel, I feel  
(I carry chains)  
You no I feel the weight  
(I feel the weight)  
Chains are the temporary things  
That should not be hanging on me  
I carry chains, chains that are made  
I carry heavy chains, I feel the weight  
I carry chains, chains that are made  
I carry chains, I feel the weight  
I carry chains, chains that are made  
I carry chains, I feel the weight
