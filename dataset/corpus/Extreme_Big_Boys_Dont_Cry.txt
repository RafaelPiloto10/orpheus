Whoever said that big boys don't cry  
You say you never shed a tear  
Well, listen that's a lie  
We're all defenseless  
When it comes to pain  
I said boys and girls alike yeah,  
We're all the same  
  
It's my party  
I'll cry if I want to  
  
Big boys don't cry  
As if nothing seems to matter  
Big boys don't cry  
Then why do I  
Big boys don't cry  
Because nothing in this world  
Ever matters  
Big boys don't cry  
  
Hey, I'm not ashamed  
To say a tear  
Is in my eye  
Because another tear  
Will take its place  
Before I die
