May not be what you think you want  
I don't fit your mold of perfection  
You see me break so many hearts  
Which explains your constant rejection  
  
But I know when it's real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down, shut me down  
Shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
Shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you ohh  
  
You believe that I'm messing 'round  
That it can't be real what I'm saying (What I'm sayin')  
But I've never felt what I feel right now  
So believe me girl, I ain't playing  
  
'Cause I know when it's real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down, shut me down  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
Shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you,  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you, ohh  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you, ohh  
  
Ohh  
  
But I know when it's real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down, shut me down  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
You shut me down, down, down, ohh  
  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you (I'm in love with you)  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
  
For what it's worth, I'm in love with you  
Said for what it's worth, I'm in love with you, ohh
