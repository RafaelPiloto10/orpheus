I heard a song 'bout a ramblin' man  
Bought a guitar and I started a band  
I got a gig at the local Am Vet  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet, yeah  
  
'69 bored out and jacked up  
A quarter mile that was all it was  
I burned the cool off of that Corvette  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet  
  
Lookin' back at the moments, black and white  
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse, for the better  
Man, I was gone, gone forever  
  
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen  
Man, we were matches and gasoline  
First taste of love never will forget  
I was gone and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet  
  
Lookin' back at the moments, black white  
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse, for the better  
Man, I was gone, gone forever  
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears  
It's hard to hate what got me here  
What got me here  
  
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile  
We missed it all by a country mile  
Went out one night for some cigarettes  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet  
  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet  
I was gone and I ain't back, ain't back, ain't back  
Gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet
