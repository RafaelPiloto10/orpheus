I took a ride in a limousine,  
I took a road I'd never been.  
I met a stranger by the way,  
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Steppin' in a slide zone.  
  
He told me where a river flows,  
He showed me how the apple grows.  
He told me of a magic stream,  
His face was worn but his eyes were clear.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
He went to find a shooting star,  
Around the bend, that's where they are.  
I went along just for the ride,  
Suddenly I began to slide.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
The air raced by there was no sound,  
We drifted high above the ground.  
And then he said you know this place,  
And then a smile lit up his face.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
I turned my head and I looked below, Slide zone...  
And there was something there I know.  
Suddenly I began to fall,  
I looked around and tried to call.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
He had me steppin' in a time zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Falling through a time zone.  
  
Help me please, I thought I said,  
Then something happened in my head.  
Music came from all around,  
And I knew what I had found.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Falling through a time zone.  
Steppin' in a slide zone,  
He had me falling through a time zone.  
Slide zone, slide zone,  
Slide zone, time zone.
