God bless us everyone  
We're a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it can't be outfought  
It can't be outdone  
It can't outmatched  
It can't be outrun  
No  
  
God bless us everyone  
We're a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it can't be outfought  
It can't be outdone  
It can't out matched  
It can't be outrun  
No  
  
And when I close my eyes tonight  
To symphonies of blinding light  
(God bless us everyone  
We're a broken people living under loaded gun, oh)  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
  
God save us everyone,  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?  
For the sins of our hand  
The sins of our tongue  
The sins of our father  
The sins of our young  
No  
  
God save us everyone,  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?  
For the sins of our hand  
The sins of our tongue  
The sins of our father  
The sins of our young  
No  
  
And when I close my eyes tonight  
To symphonies of blinding light  
(God save us everyone,  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns, oh)  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
Lift me up  
Let me go  
  
God bless us everyone  
We're a broken people living under loaded gun  
And it can't be outfought  
It can't be outdone  
It can't out matched
