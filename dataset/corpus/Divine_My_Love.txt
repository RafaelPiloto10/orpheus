When you know she can't be found,  
Through the times your feelin' down,  
You know my love, my love, my love, will be around,  
Any time you need a friend,  
And your girl won't let you in,  
You know, my love, my love will always be right here.  
  
Every time I see you with tears in your eyes,  
I get so upset,  
'Cause I know in my mind she's why your down,  
But I can't say one word,  
'Cause I know you know that your girl is hurting you,  
  
You need to let her go,  
She never wants to be around  
When your dyin' down,  
But you know...  
That I'll be there for you.  
  
When you know she can't be found,  
Through the times your feelin' down,  
You know my love, my love, my love, will be around,  
Any time you need a friend,  
And your girl won't let you in,  
You know, my love, my love will always be right here.  
  
Every time I see you kissin' her so sweet,  
I get so mad,  
'Cause she don't deserve all the love that she receives,  
But its not my place to ruin your happiness,  
'Cause your tellin' me its love,  
  
Then why are you never happy?  
She hurts you,  
And it hurts me too  
To see her put you through this pain,  
But I'm a let you know...  
That I'll be there for you.  
  
When you know she can't be found,  
Through the times your feelin' down,  
You know my love, my love, my love, will be around,  
Any time you need a friend,  
  
And your girl won't let you in,  
You know, my love, my love will always be right here.
