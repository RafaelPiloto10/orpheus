You say you want to talk it over  
Want to try again  
But there's no way of workin' out  
This love that we're not in  
  
We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'  
We've tried it all before  
It's time somebody did some walkin'  
And I can see the door  
  
So I'd just as soon go  
I'd just as soon say goodbye  
There's no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And I'd just as soon stop  
I'd just as soon end the madness  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go  
  
It's not an easy thing to do  
Leavin' seldom ever is  
But stayin' just to see us through  
Just ain't no way to live  
  
It's hard for you to understand  
But we're better off this way  
I can't fake it one more night  
Or take it one more day  
  
So I'd just as soon go  
I'd just as soon say goodbye  
There's no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And I'd just as soon stop  
I'd just as soon end the madness  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go
