Give me love  
  
Such a long time ago, I found you  
In the street with your friends  
Your friends were so strung out  
And I was taken in by your false blue eyes  
Your kiss feels like a drug, your touch feels like the sky  
  
What am I supposed to do with someone as screwed up as you  
What am I supposed to do, when my heart is stuck on you  
  
Give me love  
Give me all that you got  
Take me, forget the drugs  
  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Take me, forget the drugs  
  
I wanna come around today, but something is in my way  
I'm scared to be there, I don't know what I might see  
Demons make a fool of you, I know what you're going through  
But the night won't be long, tomorrow they'll be gone  
  
So what am I supposed to do with someone as lost as you  
So what am I supposed to do when my heart is stuck on you  
  
Give me love...
