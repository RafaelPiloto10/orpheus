People come around the window,  
People come around the door  
People come around and ask me  
If I can say some more  
'cause I'm a whisperman, yes I am!  
  
I can read somebody's back hand, and I can read your mind  
What you need is body heat, ask for it any time  
'cause I'm a whisperman, yeah, yes I am!  
  
I can see up your staircase, and I can see down your hall,  
I can see almost anything, or anything at all,  
'cause I'm a whisperman, yeah, yes I am!  
  
I can see behind your eyelid,  
I can see behind your head  
I can only check you on the windshield,  
Write them on your bed.  
'cause I'm a whisperman, yeah, yes I am!  
  
Next one's a song we do called "women is losers"
