Well, it's always been my nature to take chances  
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances  
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances  
To the tune of a concertina  
  
Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore  
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door  
But whatever it could be, makes you think you've seen me before  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud  
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd  
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed  
And the head of a hyena  
  
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?  
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?  
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode  
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed  
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road  
With your subpoena  
  
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?  
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game  
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone  
Your servants are half dead
