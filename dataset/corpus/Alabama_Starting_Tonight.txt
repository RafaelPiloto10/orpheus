If I could design forever  
I'd put you and me together each night  
Together each night  
The best I can do is promise  
I'll love you true and honest and right  
I'll love you right  
  
[Chorus:]  
Starting tonight and from now on  
I will be yours and yours alone  
Dependable and strong  
A rock by your side  
I'll be beside you through the stom  
You'll have a fire to keep you warm  
Not just for now but from now on  
Starting tonight  
  
If a man ever loved a woman  
Then surely this is the moment for me  
The moment for me  
I've never known a feeling  
So deep so real as being with you  
As being with you  
  
[Repeat chorus]
