Well, I know what it is  
But I don't know where it is  
Where it is  
Well, I know where it is  
But I don't know what it looks like  
What it looks like  
Well, I know what it looks like,  
But I don't know where she comes from  
Well, I know where she comes from,  
But I don't know what's her name.  
  
[Chorus:]  
(and she said) This is a perfect world  
I'm riding on an incline  
I'm staring in your face  
You'll photograph mine  
  
And I've been walking, talking  
Believing the things that are true  
And I've been finding  
The difference between right and wrong...good and bad  
See me put things together  
Put them back where they belong  
Am I just like the others  
Have I always been singing the same song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody said that it happens all over the world  
I do believe that it's true  
And the sun's coming up  
And we're doing all the things that we should  
Doesn't everybody here believe in the things we do?  
  
(And she said)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a strange situation  
What's wrong with you?  
Baby...baby...baby  
What you doing in my house?  
And it's all true  
There's nothing wrong with you  
(And I said)  
  
[Chorus]
