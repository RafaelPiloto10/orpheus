I need a job  
I need it right now  
Not just any old job  
But I need it right now  
  
It's gotta be a good one  
It's gotta last  
Longer than the other ones  
In the past  
  
I can work hard  
And do my thing  
Twenty-four seven  
Anything  
  
Yeah  
  
Gimme a job  
My love is unemployed  
Gimme a job  
And my heart ain't overjoyed  
Gimme a job  
I don't mean to be paranoid  
So come on over baby  
And gimme a job  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I don't care  
If the pay's no good  
Just gimme some shelter  
And throw me some food  
  
I can do the overtime  
And I won't strike  
Sign on the dotted line  
Anything you like  
  
Yeah  
  
Gimme a job  
My love is unemployed  
Gimme a job  
And my heart ain't overjoyed  
Gimme a job  
I don't mean to sound paranoid  
So come on over baby  
And gimme a job  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
I don't need no money  
To make my dream come true  
I don't need anything  
All I want is you  
  
Ain't that the truth!  
  
Uh!  
  
Gimme a job  
My love is unemployed  
Gimme a job  
And my heart ain't overjoyed  
Gimme a job  
I don't mean to be paranoid  
So come on over baby  
  
Gimme a job  
My love is on it's knees  
Gimme a job  
If you want it, then baby please  
Gimme a job  
Get me out of this deep, deep freeze  
So come on over baby  
And gimme a job
