  
  
  
  
1 I can be all that you need  
  
If you're willing to let me  
  
Let me show you just how sweet it can be  
  
You and me  
  
We can be if your mind and heart's ready  
  
Baby just let me be all you need  
  
I'm made of things that's nice  
  
Like chocolate sugar spice  
  
The kind of quality that's rarely seen  
  
Oh babe to put you in the zone  
  
I'm the kind that you take home  
  
To meet your family  
  
Fulfill your every want and need  
  
Slowly, gently, softly  
  
Baby close your eyes, and open your mind  
  
To what's in store for you  
  
I'll take you on a magic carpet ride into my world  
  
So you can see that I'm the one you need, oh  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I can't explain the way  
  
You make me feel inside  
  
I know you feel it, too  
  
And when I'm all alone  
  
You call me on the telephone  
  
Boy I'm just hooked on you  
  
Slowly, gently, softly  
  
Baby just close your eyes, open your mind  
  
To what's in store for you  
  
I'll take you on a magic carpet ride into my world  
  
So you can see that I'm the one you need  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I'll show you love  
  
Like none you've ever experienced  
  
It's now or never 'cause you'll never find  
  
Another love like mine  
  
Yeah, ah, my girl Nik in the house  
  
My girl Kia, and it's Tonia  
  
And we Divine, for your mind  
  
One time baby  
  
Ah ah, Ya don't stop, let the beat drop  
  
Yo, check it  
  
I'm just trying to say right here  
  
I'll be all you need, word  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
