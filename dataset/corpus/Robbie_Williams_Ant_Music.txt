Well I'm standing here looking at you  
What do I see?  
I'm looking straight through  
It's so sad  
When you're young  
To be told  
You're having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
Well I'm standing here what do I see?  
A big nothing  
Threatening me  
It's so sad  
When you're young  
To be told  
You're having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
Don't tread on an ant he's done nothing to you  
There might come a day  
When he's treading on you  
Don't tread on an ant you'll end up black and blue  
You cut off his head  
Legs come looking for you  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'
