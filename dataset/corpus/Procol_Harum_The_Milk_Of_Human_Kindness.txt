When you knew that I had given all the kindness that I had  
Did you think that it might be time to stop?  
When you knew that I was through  
That I'd done all I could do  
Did you really have to milk the final drop?  
Not content with my mistake  
You behaved just like a snake  
And you left me for a wasp without a sting  
Tell all my friends back home  
That I did it on my own  
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling  
  
When you knew that I had given all the kindness that I had  
Did you feel you had to break that lonely vow?  
When you knew that I was through  
That I'd done all I could do  
Did you really have to sow that final plough?  
Not content with my mistake, you behaved just like a snake  
And you left me for a wasp without a sting  
Tell all the folks back home that he did it on his own  
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling
