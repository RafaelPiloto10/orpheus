all that i want in my life  
is the feeling of peace  
deep within me truly  
  
i took a chance  
i let go  
i promised myself  
that it wouldn't scare me  
miracles appear i know  
now i can see it show  
'cause i  
  
found out what i dreamt of  
and looked it up  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
found out what was missing  
and i looked it up and  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
  
life is too short  
to hold back  
i won't live in the past  
being lonely now i know  
this is the time  
of my life  
yes i'm sure what i want  
is what i've got  
  
miracles appear i know  
now i can see it show  
'cause i  
  
found out what i dreamt of  
and i looked it up  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
found out what was missing  
and i looked it up and  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
  
now i've found out what i've  
been dreaming of  
it's the feeling of peace deep within me  
cause life is too short to hold back  
i made up my mind, i just  
  
found out what i dreamt of  
and looked it up  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
found out what was missing  
and i looked it up and  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
  
found out what i dreamt of  
and looked it up  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got  
found out what was missing  
and i looked it up and  
at this very moment  
what i want is what i've got
