Let's go down to the Sunset Grill  
We can watch the working girls go by  
Watch the "basket people" walk around and mumble  
And stare out at the auburn sky  
There's an old man there from the old world  
To him, it's all the same  
Calls all his customers by name  
  
[Chorus]  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
  
You see a lot more meanness in the city  
It's the kind that eats you up inside  
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity  
Hard to get home with any pride  
These days a man makes you somethin'  
And you never see his face  
But there is no hiding place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Respectable little murders pay  
They get more respectable every day  
Don't worry girl, I'm gonna stick by you  
And someday soon we're gonna get in that  
Car and get outta here  
  
Let's go down to the Sunset Grill  
Watch the working girls go by  
Watch the "basket people" walk around and mumble  
Gaze out at the auburn sky  
Maybe we'll leave come springtime  
Meanwhile, have another beer  
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?  
And besides, all our friends are here  
  
[Chorus]
