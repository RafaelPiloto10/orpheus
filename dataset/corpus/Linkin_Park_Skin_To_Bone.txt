Skin to bone, steel to rust  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
Will tomorrow have it's way  
With the promises we made  
Skin to bone, steel to rust.  
  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
Your deception, my disgust  
When your name is finally drawn,  
I'll be happy that you're gone  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.  
  
[Chorus]  
(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust  
  
Right to left, left to right  
Night to day and day to night  
As the starlight fades to gray,  
I'll be watching far away  
Right to left and left to right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Will tomorrow have it's way  
With the promises betrayed  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust
