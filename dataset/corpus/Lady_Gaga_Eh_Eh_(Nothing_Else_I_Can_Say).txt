Cherry cherry, boom boom  
GaGa  
  
Boy we've had a real good time and  
I wish you the best on your way, eh  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh eh  
  
I have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) I wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh)  
  
Not that I don't care about you  
Just that things got so complica- eh eh  
I met somebody cute and funny  
Got each other and that's money, eh eh  
  
I have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Eh, eh)  
I have something that I love long-long so-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh)  
  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) Wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) Wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
  
Cherry cherry, boom boom  
Eh eh, oh yeah  
All I can say is eh, eh
