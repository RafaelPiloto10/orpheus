Dream I killed God and woke up  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
He's begging "please, please, please."  
"no, don't...."  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
Time dries, time dries my mind  
Oh, I'll survive, no one can save us  
Talk to myself, talk to my soul  
  
I want you to follow  
Yes, follow...  
It's only... It's only a dream, only  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
He was lying, bleeding and wishing  
  
It's passing  
It's passing  
Dream I killed god  
Dream I killed god  
Is he dead?  
And then I dreamt of him
