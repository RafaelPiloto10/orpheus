[George Clinton]  
A fox hes got a fox.  
Mr. Wolf, hes the guy  
Who ran the woods and ate Grandma  
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog  
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandma  
  
[U-God]  
Yo,  
Must I flex my cash, to sex your ass  
I wet the ave, when I set my path  
The vette' don't crash I'm built to long last  
Grab my money clip I hit the bong fast  
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash  
Finger on the trigger wit my nigga Fred Glass  
Knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast  
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags  
Next shot go right through your hover craft  
You do the math my answer tounge slash  
When will ya learn its the return of Shaft  
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft  
My force might blur, the Porsche will purr  
The apple martini of course its stirred  
Ill do the honor, the Shaolin bomber, sharpskin armor, Ill bring the drama  
  
[Chorus (1x)]  
[George Clinton]  
A fox hes got a fox.  
Mr. Wolf, hes the guy  
Who ran the woods and ate Grandma  
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog  
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandma  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Method Man]  
  
Damn, deficatin on the map, Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap  
How real is that, you niggas hatin on the fact, that the kid is blazin on this
track and hatin on em back  
My doe stacked up wit O's, who the mack duckin po po's blowin smoke goes in
the 'Lac  
To be exact, don't want no hassle wit the stack, in the big apple, we aint
ridin apples in the back, yea, its all grillin, how the fuck ya'll feelin,
non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin em  
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin, any stuck start squealin, body
bags we was fillin em  
Yea, now I got it in the smash, a ounce ya man wanted and a llama in the dash  
Me and my comrades followin the cash, and livin everyday like tomorrow is the
last  
  
[Chorus (1x)]  
  
[George Clinton]  
A fox hes got a fox.  
Mr. Wolf, hes the guy  
Who ran the woods and ate Grandma  
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog  
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandma  
  
[George Clinton]  
I'm like the savior dog to ya baby when your lost down in the snow  
Like a coyote out in the desert  
When the first will never go, and the wolf, they never go  
  
[Verse 3]  
[Gza]  
  
Yo,  
Would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it  
Or would you take it for somethin else and get toed the fuck up  
Men come together for the common cause  
To beat your ass just because  
Theres a line he don't cross offending the boss  
While of course his one selecting through your head shot  
I'm back in the yard again the bars callin  
15 sets of this will have you swollen  
Ladies like "damn papa you lookin right, I'd love to give you some of this
pussy and ima dike"  
I write when the energy's right and spark friction  
DJ cuttin it spinnin it back mixin  
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description, for the motion picture
reenactment, activate a higher Assassian keep it classic  
Rap evolution every black yo pass that  
  
[Chorus (1x)]  
[George Clinton]  
  
A fox hes got a fox.  
Mr. Wolf, hes the guy  
Who ran the woods and ate Grandma  
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog  
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandma  
  
[George Clinton]  
I'm like the savior dog to ya baby when your lost down in the snow  
Like a coyote out in the desert  
When the first will never go, and the wolf, they never go
