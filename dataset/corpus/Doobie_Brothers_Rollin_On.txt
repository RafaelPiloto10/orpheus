Tom johnston  
Outside of town there is a river  
And it calls to me  
Like a song in the night  
A whole lotta people make way to that river  
Cause it keeps on rollin' on  
Like everything's alright  
That old river just keeps rollin' on  
Even when all love is just a song  
And like that river we just keep on rollin' along  
Everybody needs somethin' they can count on everyday  
Like a clock that keeps the time for ya  
It never drifts away  
You and me you see are different but the same  
And though we may not understand each other  
We got to try just the same  
Now all these thoughts don't mean nothin'  
If we don't live like we say  
And I for one need love and direction  
To help me find my way
