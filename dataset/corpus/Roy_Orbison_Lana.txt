Oh, beautiful lana  
I told it my mama  
And my dad  
What I had  
  
Was the sweetest  
And the neatest  
Little girl  
In the world  
  
Oh la-la-la-la lana  
La-la-la-la lana  
Hey hey lana  
He- he- hey  
  
O- oh lana  
Don't make me blue  
O- oh lana  
Don't you know  
Don't you know  
I love you

Ling-a ling-a-ling-a  
Ling-a ling-a-ling-a  
Ling-a ling-a-ling-a

Oh beautiful lana  
Don't you know that I want to  
Hug and kiss you  
Let you know that I miss you  
While we're apart  
Oh my heart  
All it can say is  
  
L-a-n-a

Oh la-la-la-la lana

Oh la-la-la-la lana

Hey hey lana  
He- he- hey
