One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh  
One went out in an English park  
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen  
Little lights in my heart  
  
One went out when I lied to my mother  
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine  
One went out within me  
Now I smoke like a chimney  
It's getting dark in this heart of mine  
It's getting dark in this heart of mine  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in the dark  
And they show us the way  
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart  
One dies when it moves away  
  
One went out in the back streets of Manchester  
One went out in an airport in Spain  
One went out, have no doubt  
When I grew up and moved out  
Of the place where the boy used to play  
  
One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor  
We used to fish and I fish no more  
Though we will not return  
I know one still burns  
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore  
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in the dark  
And they show us the way  
One lights up every time we feel love in our hearts  
One dies when it moves away  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in our hearts  
And they die along the way  
Till we're old and we're cold  
And we're lying in the dark  
'Cause they'll all burn out one day  
They'll all burn out one day  
Oh oh, they'll all burn out one day  
They'll all burn out one day  
Yeah, no
