There has to be a place for you and me  
Where we can sleep and waters still run deep  
And you're the one that sails into me  
And you're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together,  
There's only one forever  
You said to me, just give me honesty  
And in return, I'll build your santuary  
Long ago, that path was chosen  
How could we not fall in love  
Remember when we always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever  
You're the one that sails into me  
You're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever
