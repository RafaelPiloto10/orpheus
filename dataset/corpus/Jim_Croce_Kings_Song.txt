He struggled so hard to be king  
Working night and day  
Dreaming of only one thing  
Never a holiday  
Somewhere along the way  
He forgot she was only a girl  
Now his kingdom has fallen  
And it's really quite a tragic tale  
Cause he built a castle to harbor his queen  
But the queen claimed he built her a jail  
  
He struggled so hard to be king  
He wanted everything  
He built her a house by the sea  
Just to keep her in  
Somewhere along the way  
He forgot she needed a friend  
Now his kingdom has fallen  
And it's really quite a tragic tale  
Cause he built a castle to harbor his queen  
And the queen claimed he built her a jail  
  
It happened so quickly before he could know  
She was gone, far gone  
Far from the castle, the diamonds and things  
She had worn to the ball  
There was a note that she carefully wrote  
Signed it best wishes to all  
Oh you struggled so hard to be king  
Working night and day  
Dreaming of only one thing, never a holiday  
Somewhere along the way  
You forgot that I needed a man  
  
When they found him they took him back where he belonged  
And his family and friends saw him annually  
And they say it's a shame what's become of the king
