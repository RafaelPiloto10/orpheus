This is A fake song  
Jennifer never released it...  
  
Feat. Nelly  
  
[Chorus- Jennifer Lopez] (2x)  
I've had enough  
I'm tired of you treating me so rough  
Not coming home and then tryna play tough  
  
(Jennifer Lopez)  
What was I to do  
Though I had enough I still loved you  
Even when you played tough, you still was my boo  
When I told you we needed to break up, you refused  
Sometimes I felt used  
Cause I fell into ya trap when you begged at my shoes  
I remember you going to jail cause I was being abused  
Either stay or get bailed, wonder which one did you choose  
  
[Chorus:] (2x)  
  
(Nelly)  
From you saying damn me, To me hardballin' like Sammy  
  
And winning all these Grammy's, All I wanna do is start a family  
There's no need to worry  
So stop saying you'll do all that's neccessary  
To get me locked up in the penitentiary  
Its Nelly and J-Lo's time to bill  
I'm like Samuel L. In a time to kill  
Buy that Vokal fo'sho, and cop that Nellyville  
  
[Chorus:] (once)  
  
(Jennifer Lopez)  
From you coming home late, to you saying our love can wait  
And making all these tour dates  
Our relationship would only lead to fate  
My friends keep telling me to find another date, cause  
  
[Chorus:] (2x)
