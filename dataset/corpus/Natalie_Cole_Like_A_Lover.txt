Like a lover, the morning sun slowly rises and kisses you awake  
Your smile is soft and drowsy as you let it play upon your face  
Oh how I dream I might be like the morning sun to you  
  
Like a lover the river wind,  
Sighs and ripples it's fingers through your hair  
Upon your cheek it lingers, never have I known a sweeter place  
Oh how I dream I might be like the river wind to you  
  
Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips  
Let it be me, my love  
And a table that feels your fingertips  
Let it be me, let me be your love  
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you  
  
Like a lover the velvet moon shares your pillow and watches while you sleep  
It's light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in it's embrace  
Oh how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol (Like the sunshine)  
A brincar com seui rosto (Playing upon your face)  
  
Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips let it be me  
My love and a table that feels your fingertips  
Let it be me, let me be your love  
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you  
  
Like a lover the velvet moon shares you pillow and watches while you sleep  
It's light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in it's embrace  
Oh how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol (Like the sunshine)  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
A brincar com seui rosto (Playing upon your face)  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol (Like the sunshine)  
  
I might be like the velvet moon wanna be like the velvet moon  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you
