Mamas pack their lunches, kiddies pack their guns  
Wishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done  
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies  
We the people, point our fingers, blame and wonder why  
Face it and fight or turn high tail and run  
'Til it comes back again like the rising sun  
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie  
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try  
There's no recess and no rules in the school of life  
I f you listen very closely you will see what it's like  
Have cool, will travel  
Tell myself it ain't true, they just cannot see  
Grown up or sewn up, the medicine is worse than the disease  
I have cool, will travel  
Here we go
