If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well, I would fly, fly away, fly away  
And be at rest  
  
If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well, I would fly, fly away, fly away  
And be at rest  
  
Oh, since I have no wings, since  
I have no wings, since I have no wings  
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing,  
Since I have no wings, since  
I have no wings, since I have no wings  
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing,  
  
If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
I would fly, fly away, fly away  
And be at rest  
  
Since I have no wings, since  
I have no wings, since I have no wings  
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing  
Since I have no wings, since  
I have no wings, since I have no wings  
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, sing  
  
If I had the wings of a dove, imagine me  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well, I would fly, fly away, fly away  
And I would be at rest
