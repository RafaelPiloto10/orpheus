[Tag]  
When I think of the goodness of Jesus  
Makes me clap my hands  
All He's done  
And all He's done for me  
When I think of the goodness of Jesus  
Makes me dance  
When I think of the goodness of Jesus  
And all He's done for me  
When I think of the goodness of Jesus  
Makes me clap my hands  
  
[Ending]  
It makes me wanna dance  
  
Makes me wanna  
  
Dance
