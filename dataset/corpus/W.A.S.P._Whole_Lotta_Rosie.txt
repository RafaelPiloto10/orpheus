Wanna tell you a story  
Bout a woman I know  
When it comes to lovin'  
Oh, she steals the show  
Ain't exactly pretty  
Bitch ain't exaclty small  
14-39-56  
You can say she's got it all  
Never met a woman  
Never met a woman like you  
Doin' all the things  
Doin' all the things you do  
Ain't no fairy story  
Ain't no skin and bone  
But you give it all you got  
Weighin' in at nineteen stone  
You're a whole lot of woman  
A whole lot of woman  
Whole lotta Rosie  
You're a whole lotta woman  
Oh honey you can do it  
Do it to me all night long  
Only one that turns  
Only one that turns me on  
All through the night-time  
All around the clock  
Too much advising  
Don'tcha never stop  
She's a whole lot of woman  
A whole lot of woman  
Whole lotta Rosie  
You're a whole lotta woman
