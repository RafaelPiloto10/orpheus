Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
In the light of all You are  
Who am I to be found here?  
  
Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
Raised to life and crowned with love  
Jesus, Yours forever  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King?  
  
There's no greater honor  
There's no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored, I am highly favored  
  
A child of grace I have become  
Adopted into favor  
Now I sing Your Spirit's song  
Crying, "Abba Father"  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King?  
  
There's no greater honor  
There's no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored, I am highly favored

Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King?  
  
There's no greater honor  
There's no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored, I am highly favored  
  
Who I have become in You  
Who I have become in You  
Who I have become in You  
Who I have become in You  
  
I am highly favored  
I am highly favored  
I am highly favored  
Who I have become in You?  
I am highly favored
