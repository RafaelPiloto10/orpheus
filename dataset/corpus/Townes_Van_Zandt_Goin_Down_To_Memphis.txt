Goin' down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
I can drive me a car  
But I don't need no car at all  
I believe I'll ride that Memphis cannon ball  
  
She runs so fast  
You can't catch her from behind  
Ah, she runs so fast  
You can't catch her from behind  
But I'll be there waitin'  
For that little Memphis girl of mine  
  
Why I left  
Guess I'll never know  
Why I left  
Man, I guess I'll never know  
Sittin' here thinkin'  
I'm one dumb-ass so and so  
  
I'm headed back  
That Memphis train  
She leaves real soon  
The Memphis train  
Sound like she leaves real soon  
Got nothin' to guide me  
'Cept the color of the moon  
Hangin' over Memphis  
  
Headed down  
Where the Mississippi runs  
Boys I'm headed home  
Back where the Mississippi runs  
I hear there's some lovin' there  
Try to get me some  
  
Headed down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
Just don't know  
Why I ever left at all  
I'm gettin' on that train, man,  
I ain't even gonna call  
Be there 'fore the break of day
