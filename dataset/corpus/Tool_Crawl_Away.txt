You crawled away from me.  
Slipped away from me.  
I tried to keep a hold,  
But there was nothing I could say.  
You slid and crept away  
And there was nothing I could say.  
So what you're trying to say  
Is you don't wanna play.  
But what you want and what you need  
Doesn't mean fuck to me.  
Because I can see your back is turning.  
If I could I'd stick the knife in.  
This is love.  
This is my love for you.  
Get up.  
Now.  
Say you won't go.
