Oh so all my lovin' go's  
Under the fog fog fog  
And I will leave them all  
Well I'm just a poor little baby  
Cause well I believe them all  
  
Oh so while your growing old  
Under the gun gun gun  
And I believe them all  
Well I'm just one poor baby  
Cause well I believe them all  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
I wish I could buy back  
The woman you stole  
  
[Chorus]  
Why-control, why-control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners  
Out of control, out of control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners  
Out of control, high control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners  
Out of control, out of control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners out  
  
Oh so all my lovin' go's  
Under the fog fog fog  
And I believe them all  
Well I'm just a poor little baby  
Cause well I believe them all  
  
[Repeat pre-chorus and chorus once]
