There is something I gotta tell you  
It goes like this  
  
Do you know you control  
Every single breath I take  
You can see through my soul,  
I feel it in the love we make  
  
And I try to find a place  
Where I can hide (yeah)  
But every time I try to fight  
The feeling it takes over me(yeah)  
  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
Yeah, it must be love  
  
When we talk you can read  
Every word inside my head  
Like you know what I need,  
And I can't imagine anywhere  
I d wanna be then right here with you baby,  
Next to me  
Why can't you see I try to fight  
The feeling, but I do believe(yeah)  
  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
It must be love  
  
It must be love (3x)  
  
I try to find a place  
Where I can hide(yeah)  
But everytime I try to fight  
The feeling it takes over me(Oouh)  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
It must be love  
It must be love
