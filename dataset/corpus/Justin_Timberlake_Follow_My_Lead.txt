You don't feel love from nobody  
And brand new problems keep coming  
They follow you, you keep running  
Don't doubt, boy, don't you hear something  
  
Gone through it if you just living  
It might just make you a victim  
Just let it go you won't miss it  
It's in the look just go get it

The rescue that you need?  
It's not a dream, that's happening

The crew all around you keeps changing  
Come back to what you keep waiting  
There's nothing to come save you  
Just let it an infinite take you  
  
To a place where every thing's better  
You've been waiting forever  
Live life like it don't matter  
It won't stop if you don't let it
