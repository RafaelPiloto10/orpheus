You can't stare into the sun  
You can't pretend to have fun  
Shake your head  
  
You can't read a robot's mind  
Can't expect vultures to be kind  
Shake your head  
  
Can't tune a radio to heaven  
You can't live seven lives  
Shake your head  
  
You can't win money at the horses  
You can't fight the armed forces  
Shake your head  
  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Let's go to bed  
  
You can't sing underwater  
You can't have the boss' daughter  
Shake your head  
  
You can't make missiles out of mud  
You can't purify bad blood  
Shake your head  
  
You can't sue Buddha for libel  
You can't rewrite the Bible  
Shake your head  
  
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth  
Can't put your finger on the truth  
Shake your head  
  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Let's go to bed  
  
You can't feed the hungry  
Can't talk Shakespeare to a monkey  
Shake your head  
  
You can't bunk to square ball  
You can't fight City Hall  
Shake your head  
  
You can't argue with death  
Can't break a burly sailor's neck  
Shake your head  
  
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses  
You can't influence the masses  
Shake your head  
  
You can't become invisible  
Can't bullshit the Devil  
Shake your head  
  
You can't ban the bomb  
And there's no way to stay calm  
Shake your head  
  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Let's go to bed  
  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Shake your head  
Let's go to bed  
  
Shake your head  
(Let's go to bed)  
Shake your head  
(Let's go to bed)  
  
Shake your head  
(Let's go to bed)  
Let's go to bed  
Let's go to bed
