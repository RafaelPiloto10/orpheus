They only show you their gums when they smile  
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now, how vile  
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce  
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss  
  
Hey, stand up  
Toothless people, their breath is lethal, want to tell you  
Hey, come on, stand up, get on your feet  
Toothless people, old and feeble, what I say  
  
No more of those pearly whites will they possess  
Their oral hygiene is frightful, a mess  
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease  
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities  
  
Hey, stand up, take out your teeth  
Toothless people, old and feeble, oh yes  
  
You can brush 'em, you can floss 'em  
They're something you just can't ignore  
If you lose 'em, you're in trouble  
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more  
You need something to show your dentist  
The next time he makes you say "Ah"  
You don't want to have to wind up  
Eating all of your food through a straw  
  
(Like toothless people, toothless people)  
You'd better brush your teeth now (hey)  
Toothless, toothless, toothless, toothless people  
Hey, stand up, toothless people
