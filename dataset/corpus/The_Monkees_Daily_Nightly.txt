Darkened, rolling figures move through prisms of no color  
Hand-in-hand, they walk the night  
But never know each other  
Passioned pastel neon lights light up the jeweled traveler  
Who, lost in scenes of smoke-filled dreams  
Find questions, but no answers  
  
Startled eyes that sometimes see phantasmagoric splendor  
Pirouette down palsied paths  
With pennies for the vendor  
Salvation's yours for just the time it takes to pay the dancer  
And once again such anxious men  
Find questions, but no answers  
  
The night has gone and taken it's infractions  
While saddened eyes hope there will be a next one  
  
Sahara signs look down upon a world that glitters glibly  
And mountain sides put arms around  
The unsuspecting city  
Second hands that minds have slowed are moving even faster  
Toward bringing down someone who's found  
The questions, but no answers
