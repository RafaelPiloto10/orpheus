When you met me, oh oh, everything was rosy, ah ah  
If you let me, oh oh, everything must surely work out fine  
If you go, oh oh, everything's that's rosy turns to pieces  
You know, oh oh, everything will go under, believe me  
  
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?  
If you ever leave me by my side  
Where will I run to? What would I do?  
I really am, I really can, I really do, I really have a love for you  
  
Now, if you get me, oh oh, that could save us all some conversation  
Don't upset me, oh oh, everything is cosy here tonight  
If I move, oh oh, you'd be standing by, it would make a difference  
Is it true, oh oh, are you coming through, or were you just leaving?  
  
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?  
If you ever leave me by my side  
Where will I run to? Baby, where would I hide?  
I really am, I really would, I really am, I really have a love for you  
Yes, I do (yes, I do)  
  
Oh, yeah yeah yeah (oh oh, oh oh)  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, babe, babe (oh oh, oh oh)  
Oh yeah, would you ever leave me? (Oh oh)  
  
Yeah, where will I run to? Where would I hide?  
If you ever leave me by my side  
Where will I run to? Baby, baby, what will I do?  
I really am, I really would, I really am, I really have a love for you  
Yes, I do  
  
When you met me, oh oh, everything was rosy  
If you let me, oh oh, everything must surely work out fine  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
(oh oh)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah (oh oh)  
  
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?  
If you ever leave me by my side  
Where will I run to? Baby, baby, what will I do?  
I really am, I really can, I really do, I really have a love for you
