Can't seem to find my way  
Someone tell me what to say  
Where am I going  
Where did I come from  
I don't know, I don't know  
Almost got to paradise  
But the smoke always gets  
In my eyes  
Everything I do is wrong  
I'm so bad . . . so bad  
Late at night, they're asleep  
I'm awake, get the urge  
Hit the street, jump a curb  
Alleyway, dark and wet  
Set the trap, I forget  
Who I am. But I know  
I'll get you . . I'm so bad  
I was born inside a cage  
Never knew anything but rage  
Although I tried so hard to adjust  
Love is something I don't understand  
Take what I need and I get what I can  
OH . . . I'm so bad  
I wake up in the morning so tired  
Dreamt that I was walking through fire  
The fire didn't hurt me though  
We're old friends  
Can't seem to find my way  
Someone tell me what to say  
Everything I do is wrong  
Pass the time, lie in bed  
Hotel room, T.V. set  
Got to move, might be dead  
Catch a ride, I'm awake  
Join a crowd, hidden blade  
Buy a drink, you better pray  
I don't get you  
I'm so bad . . . so bad
