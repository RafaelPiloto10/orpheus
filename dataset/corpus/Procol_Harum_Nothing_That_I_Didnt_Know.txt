Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
I couldn't believe it, but it's true  
Twenty-six, and now she's dead  
I wish that I could have died instead  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
Did you see how thin and pale she grew?  
So much suffering, could not hide  
Endless heartache 'til she died  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
Strike me dead, for making it true  
Strike me dead, for letting it go  
Nothing that I didn't know  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
I couldn't believe it, but it's true  
Twenty-six, and now she's dead  
I wish that I could have died instead
