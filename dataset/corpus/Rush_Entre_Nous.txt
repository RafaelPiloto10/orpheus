We are secrets to each other  
Each one's life a novel  
No-one else has read  
Even joined in bonds of love  
We're linked to one another  
By such slender threads  
  
We are planets to each other  
Drifting in our orbits  
To a brief eclipse  
Each of us a world apart  
Alone and yet together  
Like two passing ships  
  
Just between us  
I think it's time for us to recognize  
The differences we sometimes feared to show  
Just between us  
I think it's time for us to realize  
The spaces in between  
Leave room  
For you and I to grow  
  
We are strangers to each other  
Full of sliding panels  
An illusion show  
Acting well-rehearsed routines  
Or playing from the heart?  
It's hard for one to know  
  
We are islands to each other  
Building hopeful bridges  
On the troubled sea  
Some are burned or swept away  
Some we would not choose  
But we're not always free
