Well, I recall days in the city  
And I think back, "Oh what a pity"  
Rememberin' how it wasn't pretty  
Every day life in the city  
Out in the street we had to take it  
With friends around, couldn't it  
What wasn't there, we had to make it  
Hangin' out down in the city  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
We had to fight to be accepted  
It wasn't right and I protested  
For hangin' out we got arrested  
Every day life in the city  
  
We'd go to school and then we'd cut out  
Go to the park and space our heads out  
We called it fun but there was some doubt  
Hangin' out down in the city  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
I don't wanna be there or even think back  
I don't wanna be there, now I'm on the right track, yeah  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
I don't wanna be there or even think back  
I don't wanna be there, 'cause I'm on the right track  
Now I'm on the right track  
I'm finally on the right track  
I'm finally on the right track
