You want me to say I love you too  
There's nothing in the world I'd rather do  
You will never know how hard I've tried  
But I can't change the way I feel inside  
It's nothing that you did or haven't done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone?  
I wish that's the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel  
It's nothing that you did or haven't done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone?  
I wish that's the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I can't help the way but I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Oh, I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel, oh, oh, oh
