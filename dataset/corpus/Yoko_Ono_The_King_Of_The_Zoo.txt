He was the king of the zoo, (king of the zoo)  
Yes, he was, oh, he was,  
Ooooh. (ooooh)  
Facing his crowd, his head high and proud,  
While they threw breadcrumbs, laughing through their gums.  
(doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)  
He was the king of the zoo, (king of the zoo)  
Yes, he was, oh, he was,  
Ooooh. (ooooh)  
When the gates was closed at night  
And no one was in sight,  
He would pace around what was called his ground.  
Dreaming of the land in his minds eye,  
Roaring, roaring to the dark sky.  
He was a show (show) stopper,  
A mind (mind) topper,  
He was a dreamer, (he was a dreamer) he was a king.  
Yes, he was, (yes, he was) oh, he was, (oh, he was)  
Ooooh, that he was.  
Show stopper, mind topper,  
Show stopper, mind topper,  
Show stopper, mind topper,  
Show stopper, mind topper,  
Show stopper, mind topper.
