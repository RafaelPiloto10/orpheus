You made me laugh some  
You made me cry some too  
You sent me off to a world of pain  
You made me someone new  
You made all kinds of promises  
But only some came true  
Now I now you need me  
More than I need you  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
You know I'm not perfect  
I tried to make you see  
Somehow you thought of everything  
But you didn't think of me  
Lies and disappointment makes your world go round  
It's too late to save me  
So you might as well come down  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But, we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But, we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway
