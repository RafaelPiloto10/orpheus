This time  
I won't show I'm vulnerable  
This time  
I won't give in first  
This time  
I will hold out with my love  
This time  
I will not be hurt  
  
I'm gonna love myself  
More than anyone else  
I'm gonna treat me right  
I'm gonna make you say  
That you love me first  
And you'll be the one with the most to lose tonight  
This time  
  
This time  
I won't let my emotions rule my life  
This time  
I'm gonna keep my heart locked safe inside  
This time  
I'm gonna be my own best friend  
This time  
I'm gonna be the one  
  
To win your love, your affection  
To hide my fear of rejection  
This time
