This one's for the girl that I see at the coffee shop  
Who knows my name and looks so hot  
I always get an extra shot and smile for free  
  
And this is for the girl, so sugar sweet  
At the bus stop waiting for the 23  
She's so shy, I wish she'd notice me  
  
This one's for the girls x2  
  
This one's for the girl in the pub sitting next to me  
She spends too much on the fruit machine  
She drinks me under the table every time  
  
And what about the one from around the way?  
She's not all that, but that's okay  
She talks to tree's but still, she blows my mind  
  
Woah woah woah ohh  
There's nothing better  
Woah woah woah ohh  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
And this one's for the girl at the club in the trilby hat  
Standing up on the bar shaking this and that  
Even though she's got that big exam at 8  
  
And here's to all those office girls  
From the secretaries to the CEO  
Baby when you coming home?  
Coz I can't wait  
  
Woah woah woah ohh  
There's nothing better  
Woah woah woah ohh  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
I love to love those girls  
  
Huh, listen  
I love those Scottish girls  
I can't resist the Irish girls, and  
The Welsh and English girls  
Haha, and don't forget the Essex girls  
  
No matter where I go  
No matter what I do  
The only thing I know  
It's all about the girls  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
(This one's for the girls)  
I can't stop thinking about you  
(This one's for the girls)  
Life would suck without you  
(This one's for the girls)  
  
Ohh  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls
