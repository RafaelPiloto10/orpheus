I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing  
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in  
'Cause I got time while she got freedom  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even  
  
Her best days will be some of my worst  
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first  
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no  
  
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you,  
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces  
  
They say bad things happen for a reason  
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding  
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving  
And when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, no  
  
What am I gonna to do when the best part of me was always you,  
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces  
(One still in love while the other ones leaving)  
I'm falling to pieces  
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)  
  
Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain  
You took your suitcase, I took the blame  
Now I'm try'na make sense of what little remains ooh  
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name  
  
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing  
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in  
'Cause I got time while she got freedom  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break  
No it don't break  
No it don't breakeven no  
  
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you and  
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
(Oh glad your okay now)  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
I'm falling to pieces  
(One still in love while the other ones leaving)  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)  
  
Oh it don't breakeven no  
Oh it don't breakeven no  
Oh it don't breakeven no
