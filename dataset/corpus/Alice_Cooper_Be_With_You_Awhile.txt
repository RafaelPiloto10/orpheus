I wish I could tell you something you didn't know  
I wish I could give you something you didn't owe  
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
I just want to take you somewhere you haven't been  
Find an old time movie where we don't know the end  
Lost in the radio, drive another mile  
So I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you....
