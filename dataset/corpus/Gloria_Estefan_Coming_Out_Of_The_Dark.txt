Why be afraid if I'm not alone  
Though life is never easy the rest is unknown  
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone  
Spent each and every moment  
Searching for what to believe  
  
Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now  
It's shining on me  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
You're sharing with me  
  
Starting again is part of the plan  
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand  
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can  
It may not make it easier but I have felt you  
Near all the way  
  
Coming out of the dark, i finally see the light now  
And it's shining on me ( I see the light, I see the light)  
See the light  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
You're sharing with me  
  
Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love  
Forever and ever I'll stand on the rock  
Can't nobody stop me from watching  
Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love  
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face  
  
Coming out of the dark, (Coming out of the dark)  
I see the light, I feel love shinning on me (Shining, shining)  
Shining on me  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
You're sharing, you're sharing with me, sharing with me, sharing with me  
  
Coming out of the dark,  
Making it into the light  
Your love shining on me, shining on me, shining on me  
Coming out of the dark,  
I see the light, I see the light  
Shining, shining, shining on me  
Shining, shining  
Coming out of the dark  
I see the light now  
Yes I see the light
