As the seasons go circlin', and the years spin away  
And the highway grows narrow, at the end of the day  
There's a promise I made you, on the first day of spring  
To have and to hold, this gold wedding ring  
  
To have and to hold, 'till death do us part  
In sickness or health, with all the love in my heart  
For richer, for poorer, 'till we both have grown old  
Through all of life's seasons, to have and to hold  
  
And if we can have children, or live all alone  
The light of our love, will forever be shown  
Our union is timeless, our love beyond worth  
To have and to hold, 'till the ends of the earth  
  
To have and to hold, 'till death do us part  
In sickness or health, with all the love in my heart  
For richer, for poorer, 'till we both have grown old  
Through all of life's seasons, to have and to hold  
Through all of life's seasons, to have and to hold
