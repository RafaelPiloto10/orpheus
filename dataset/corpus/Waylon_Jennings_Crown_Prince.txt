His father was a Princeton lawyer  
A man of means  
His mother summa-cum-laude  
Former beauty queen  
With a house as big as a hotel  
On Spencer boulevard  
That's where he got his start  
  
Eighteen years of summer camp  
And private schools  
All american golden boy  
With a silver spoon  
His future held all the promise of a president  
Wonder where it went  
  
It's hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You can't hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
The real world's not a playground  
It's a danger zone  
You find out who you really are  
When the pressures on  
He's the first one in his family to wind up second best  
He couldn't pass the test  
  
His share of the fortune  
Spent on saving face  
His family comes to visit  
On the holidays  
Sometimes it's so quite there  
He hears the flowers bloom  
He's got a private room  
  
It's hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You can't hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
Insanity is a state of mind  
Where life begins  
Or where it ends  
It all depends
