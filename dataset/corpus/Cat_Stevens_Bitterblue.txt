I gave my last chance to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue  
No bitterblue  
  
Yes, I've done all one man can do  
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
Cause I've been running a long time  
On this travelling ground  
Wishing hard to be free  
Of going round and round  
Yes I've been moving a long time  
But only up and down  
I gave my last hope to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
I've done all one man can do  
Please help me lose this bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
Cause I've been waiting a long time  
Aeons been and gone --  
Looking at the horizon  
For my light to dawn  
Oh yes I've been living a long time  
Looking on and on  
  
I've been running a long time  
Summers come and gone --  
Drifting under the dream clouds  
Past the broken sun --  
  
Yes I've been living a long time  
To be back beyond  
I gave my first chance to you  
Don't hand it back bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
I've done all one man can do  
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue  
My bitterblue, bitterblue  
  
I gave my last chance to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
