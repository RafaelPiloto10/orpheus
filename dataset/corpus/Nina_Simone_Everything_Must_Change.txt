everything must change  
nothing stays the same  
everyone will change  
no one, no one stays the same  
  
the young become the old  
and mysteries do unfold  
for that's the way of time  
no one, and nothing goes unchanged  
  
there are not many things in life one can be sure of  
except rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
winter turns to spring  
a wounded heart will heal  
oh but never much too soon  
no one, and nothing goes unchanged  
  
The young become the old  
and mysteries do unfold  
for that's the way of time  
no one, and nothing stays unchanged  
  
there are not many things in life one can be sure of  
except rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
everything must change
