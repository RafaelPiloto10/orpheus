We're never done with killing time  
Can I kill it with you?  
'Til the veins run red and blue  
We come around here all the time  
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you  
  
You pick me up and take me home again  
Head out the window again  
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain  
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel  
Pulses can drive from here  
We might be hollow, but we're brave  
  
(And I like you)  
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)  
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)  
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)  
We move in the tree streets  
I'd like it if you stayed  
  
Now we're wearing long sleeves  
And the heating comes on  
(You buy me orange juice)  
We're getting good at this  
Dreams of clean teeth  
I can tell that you're tired  
But you keep the car on  
While you're waiting out front  
  
You pick me up and take me home again  
Head out the window again  
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain  
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel  
Pulses can drive from here  
We might be hollow, but we're brave  
  
(And I like you)  
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)  
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)  
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)  
We move in the tree streets  
I'd like it if you stayed
