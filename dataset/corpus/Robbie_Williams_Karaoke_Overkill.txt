We're all so chic living in class A  
Partying and search sweet sorrow today  
When you don't know who your friends are  
And neither do they  
We're all so amused  
And maybe it's better that way  
She's been seen with him  
He's been seen with her  
Happy propaganda  
Just as their 5 current sur  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
We're insecure, making me think  
I'm not fit to laze your dream  
I've seen you in my bayer  
You're a real player  
Taking it easy, taking it easy  
We all know we shouldn't  
And that is why we do it  
Here's smuggler's house  
Why don't you come and view it  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
The sooner the better  
I'll send you a letter  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker  
Give us a clue of  
Seeing the night thru  
And you're so kain  
This song ain't about you  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker
