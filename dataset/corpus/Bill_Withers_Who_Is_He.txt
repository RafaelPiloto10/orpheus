A man we passed just tried to stare me down  
And when I looked at you  
You looked at the ground  
I don't know who he is  
But I think that you do  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
Ahh  
Something in my heart and in your eye  
Tells me he's not someone just passing by  
Ahh  
And when you cleared your throat  
Was that your cue?  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
Ahh now  
When I add the sum of you and me  
I get confused when I keep coming up with 3  
You're too much for one man  
But not enough for two  
Dadgummit  
Who is he and what is he to you?  
Well  
You tell me men don't have much intuition  
Is that what you really thinkin girl  
Or are you wishing?  
Before you wreck your old home  
And searcht another new  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
(x4)
