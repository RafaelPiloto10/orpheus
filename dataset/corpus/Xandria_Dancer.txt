She walks on the moonlit snow  
She's winter hearted, so you say  
But you don't see  
She's a dancer on the glass  
That's broken like her past  
She would never flee  
Fascination is her name  
She is dancing in the wind  
Almost dancing everything  
Every moment of her life  
She is taking me with her  
With the music in her heart  
She is breaking every ice  
She is talking with the world  
A far-traveled bird  
Her soul's her home  
See how light are all her moves  
Just follows her own rules  
But she is not alone  
Fascination is her name  
She is dancing in the wind  
Almost dancing everything  
Every moment of her life  
She is taking me with her  
With the music in her heart  
She is breaking every ice  
She is dancing in the wind  
Almost dancing everything  
Every moment of her life  
She is taking me with her  
With the music in her heart  
She is breaking every ice in me
