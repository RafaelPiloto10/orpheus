[Jethro Tull]  
  
In the shuffling madness  
Of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser  
Headlong to his death  
And he feels the piston scraping  
Steam breaking on his brow  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
No way to slow down, oh  
  
He sees his children jumping off  
At stations one by one  
His woman and his best friend  
In bed and having fun  
And oh, he's crawling down the corridor  
On his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
No way to slow down, oh  
No way to slow down  
  
He hears the silence howling  
When he catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner  
Has got him by the balls  
Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible  
And it's open at page one  
I think God, he stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down
