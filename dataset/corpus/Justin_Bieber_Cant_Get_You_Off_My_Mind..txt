Verse 1:  
I messed up the first part of our love. I messed up our relationship. I know
what we had came from above. But I don't know if this is it. Every day I talk
to your picture. Hangin on my wall. Sayin how much I miss her, I miss it
all...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 2:  
I messed up your life. I messed up my time. I know what we had was all right.
But I don't know if you cry at night. Sayin to your parents, saying I am bad.
Telling them. "he was all that I had."  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 3:  
What we had is dead and gone. It will be too long. Before me and you are
together. But I guess not anymore...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
(Yeah) (yeah) woahhhh! (yeah) (yeah) can't get you off my mind.
