Empty spaces fill me up with hopes  
Distant faces with no place left to go  
Without you within me I can't find no rest  
Where I'm going is anybody's guess  
  
[Chorus]  
I tried to go on like I never knew you  
I'm awake but my world is half asleep  
I pray for this heart to be unbroken  
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete  
  
Voices tell me I should carry on  
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone  
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face  
You still wonder if we made a big mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mean to drag it on  
But I can't seem to let you go  
I don't want to make you face this world alone  
I want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Incomplete
