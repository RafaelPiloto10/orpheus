Come outside and see a brand new day  
The troubles in your mind will blow away  
It's easy to believe they're here to stay  
But you won't find them standing in your way  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Although we see the world through different eyes  
We share the same idea of paradise  
So don't search in the starts for signs of love  
Look around your life, you'll find enough  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Why do you want to sit alone in Gothic gloom  
Surrounded by the ghosts of love that haunt your room?  
Somewhere there's a different door to open wide  
You gotta throw those skeletons out of your closet and come outside  
  
So you will see a brand new day  
The troubles in your mind will blow away  
It's easy to believe they're here to stay  
But you won't find them standing in your way  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young
