I remember when you seemed real shiny with the sweat of your voice  
Shaky hands super load and teenage mouth  
We were all charmed and taken by your talk  
Now I shudder when I hear the rhythm of your walk  
Now I've got no place to go I've got no place to go  
I've got no one nowhere no one  
  
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in your eyes  
I have sinned the sin of wanting more  
The belly fire pulls the spirit from the corporate whore  
I'm embarrassed by the plaid you wear  
  
If I were you I'd hide behind that stupid bleach blond hair  
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
  
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in you  
Yeah, that simple minded sparkle that I thought I saw  
Yes, I have wondered why you changed  
I like it when you were super loud  
I have wondered why you changed  
I like it when you were super loud  
  
Now I've got nowhere to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
I wonder if you're giving in, tell me why you're giving in  
Tell me why you're giving in
