It's a wonder at all that I'm alive  
It's a wonder at all that I'm still standing  
It's a wonder at all that I survived the war  
  
Between your, between your heart and mine  
Between your, between your heart and mine  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out, you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
This is war  
  
It's a wonder at all that I can see  
It's a wonder at all that the sky is not falling down  
It's a wonder at all that I decide to breathe  
Anymore anymore anymore  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out, you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
This is war  
This is war  
  
This is war, this is war  
I will run until I can't run anymore  
Someone's got to lose  
It's not gonna be this girl this time  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
And this is war  
This is war
