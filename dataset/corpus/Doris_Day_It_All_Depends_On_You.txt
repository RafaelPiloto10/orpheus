Lovers depend on moonlight  
For a love affair  
Babies depend on mothers  
For their tender care  
Flowers depend on sunshine  
And the morning dew  
Each thing depends on something  
And I depend on you  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad  
It all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud  
It all depends on you  
I can save money, or spend it  
Go right on living, or end it  
You're to blame, Honey  
For what I do  
I know that I can be beggar  
I can be King  
I can be almost any old thing  
It all depends on you  
  
Isn't it sweet to know, Dear  
You can help me on  
Wouldn't it hurt to know, Dear  
All my hopes were gone  
Wouldn't it make you proud, Dear  
If I made a name  
But if I failed to win, dear  
Would you want all the blame  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad  
It all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud  
It all depends on you  
I can save money, or spend it  
Go right on living, or end it  
You're to blame, honey  
For what I do  
I know that I can be beggar,  
I can be King  
I can be almost any old thing  
It all depends on you  
Yes, it all depends on you
