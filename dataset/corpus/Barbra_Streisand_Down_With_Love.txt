Down with love  
With flowers and rice and shoes  
Down with love  
The root of all midnight blues  
Down with things  
That give you that well-known pain  
Take that moon  
Wrap it in cellophane  
  
Down with love let's liquidate  
All it's friends  
Like moon, June, roses  
And rainbow's ends  
Down with songs  
That mourn about night and day  
Down with love  
Take it away, away  
  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds  
To bees and the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs, down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
Down with love  
  
Down with love  
Liquidate all it's friends  
Like moon, June, roses  
And rainbow's ends  
Down with song  
That mourns about night and day  
You are the one,  
And i don't stand a chance with a ghost like you  
Ah, the promised kiss of spring is here,  
What does my heart go dancin' overhead,  
On the ceiling near my bed,  
We go now,  
Because i talk to the trees, but they don't listen to me  
I tell them: you say either, i say i-ther  
You say neither, i say neither, i say ni-ther  
Either, i-ther  
Neither, ni-ther  
Let's call the whole thing off!  
  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds  
And the bees and the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs, down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
  
Down, down, down  
I go on round and round  
I go in a spin  
Hey, in the spin, I'm in!  
What is this thing  
What is this thing called love?
