I sit and wonder, I often wonder  
I sit and wonder about the things she does  
I sit and wonder, I often wonder  
I've been waiting for this moment to come  
  
And she's the teacher and I'm the pupil but I ain't learning anything at all  
Now I' m falling into the black hole and I can barely feel the sun  
  
Yeah I sit and wonder, I fall to pieces  
I've been waiting for her to come  
A bed of roses, her cheeks like peaches  
Yeah I ain't going to wait no more  
  
Give me some light, give the light, yeah give me some light, give me some
light  
  
Well writes a passage, we are mistaken, yeah  
Some are going to break into stone,  
The door is open and I am reaching, yeah  
It looks like a prodigal son  
  
Yeah give me some light, give the light, yeah give me some light, give me some
light  
  
God give me the light, give me the light, yeah give me some light, give me
some light  
  
I've been there doing it to my mind Lord  
  
Something is going on inside my head Lord  
Something is going on inside my head Lord
