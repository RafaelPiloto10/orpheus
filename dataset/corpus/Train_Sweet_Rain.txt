Well, I remember when every other day was bad  
You were my brother, so tall, was all you had  
Cerano was dead, but we had you instead  
Now I remember our precious petting zoo  
  
Our delicate high school  
And all the things we said we'd do, they all fall like  
Sweet Rain, wet my memory  
Sweet Rain, come on down on me  
It wasn't hard to look ahead  
You wanted to be me instead  
I wanted to be you instead  
But I fell and you fell back  
  
What is wrong with me?  
Well, what is wrong with you, Jack?  
Everybody knew she was coming  
Everybody knew that she was just too much for you  
Sweet Rain, wet my memory  
Sweet Rain, come on down on me  
The big screen got in between  
What it was and what we've seen  
  
How have you been?  
What have you been?  
I think about you now and again  
I think about you every single day  
Shit, I'm thinking about you right now  
And I know everybody here wants you  
I know everybody here thinks they need  
I've been waiting here just to touch you  
Ooh ooh yeah yeah  
Sweet Rain
