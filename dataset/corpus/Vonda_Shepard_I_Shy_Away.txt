  
  
  
  
Since I met you, I've missed you all my life  
  
What I don't know won't hurt me baby  
  
Since I've known you, I can recall the old times  
  
  
Wasn't that your face in my old photographs  
  
Didn't we laugh and talk for hours baby  
  
Really want to see you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
I don't ask you about the girls in your life  
  
'Cause what I don't know might hurt me baby  
  
I don't question when something feels right  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin'  
  
I could fall in live with you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you...  
  
  
(Bridge)  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share to love  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share the love  
  
Share the love  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin'  
  
I could really fall in love with you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
(I don't you know what I'm going through)  
  
Baby I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
(Chorus)
