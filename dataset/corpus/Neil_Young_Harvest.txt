Did I see you down in a young girl's town  
With your mother in so much pain?  
I was almost there at the top of the stairs  
With her screamin' in the rain.  
  
Did she wake you up to tell you that  
It was only a change of plan?  
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup  
With the promise of a man.  
  
Did I see you walking with the boys  
Though it was not hand in hand?  
And was some black face in a lonely place  
When you could understand?  
  
Did she wake you up to tell you that  
It was only a change of plan?  
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup  
With the promise of a man.  
  
Will I see you give more than I can take?  
Will I only harvest some?  
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp  
Or fuse it in the sun?  
  
Did she wake you up to tell you that  
It was only a change of plan?  
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup  
With the promise of a man.
