Running every where tryna find where I am  
Goin no where so am tryin again  
I'm so lost like paper no pen  
Yes you've called so ya here I am  
Cold no switer bold no letter so much better  
My roll go geter my tall is rether and a fire on my eyes am a rain no  
Weather  
The goal am a set is a whole life better  
When the storm from jahova come am'll be the best ever  
Love from the start peace in my heart we'd never be apart  
But I still wounder have I fought the thunder I can feel it in my heart  
Shooting like a hunter  
Ya a stright gunner  
But it's feells strange now that thing in my heart makes things change  
How I felt before when my brain rearange and what I do before is defintly  
Not the same  
Could I just take a minute ya just wait a minute  
Starting the heat the minute we have to pay the minute  
Alright oky the minute or we can wait a minute  
See how long a time it just takes to just say a minute  
Life is so short but we take it for granit  
Payin over my life and it was a life that I was handle  
Flyin so high yes I just landed  
Am tryina figure out what my planes  
His hand is on my life him ascend just vanish  
But I felt for wash his of quick like a  
I'm goin nut quick like a grow men is  
Am'll be set so will my big grand kids  
Swag
