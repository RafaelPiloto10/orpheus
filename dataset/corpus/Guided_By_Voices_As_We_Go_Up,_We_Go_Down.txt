I can't terrorize I see terror in your eyes  
As we go up, we go down  
I can't socialize I'll be institutionalized  
As we go up, we go down  
  
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh  
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh  
  
I speak in monotone: "Leave my fucking life alone"  
As we go up we go down  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)
