You never knew how much I loved you I tried but you just couldn't see the
light  
You're out there somewhere with her now I guess it's best for you  
But my days are darker than your nights  
My days are darker than your nights I wait for mornings that never arise  
There's just no end as long as I'm alive my days are darker than your nights  
  
You'll never know just what I'm going through  
I hope you'll never need someone like I need you  
You're happy now you've got just what you want  
But don't think that I'll forget you cause I won't  
My days are darker than your nights...
