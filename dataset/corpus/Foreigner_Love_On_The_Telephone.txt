Monday, Tuesday, three days and more  
Pretty soon you don't know anymore  
Friday, the sixth day, Saturday seems late  
Don't know how much longer I can wait  
  
Ooh, could ya wait 'til I get home  
Ooh, we need to be alone  
'N' I don't wanna lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
You make me nervous 'cause the line's engaged  
I can't believe we let it get to this stage  
Sittin' here waitin' for you to give me a sign  
You know I got my heart on the line  
  
Ooh, I know that I was wrong  
Ooh, I've been away too long  
I can't stand to lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Hello operator  
You know that I've been waitin' on this call  
I said, hey, operator  
If you're givin' me a bad time  
I'm gonna tear this phone right off the wall
