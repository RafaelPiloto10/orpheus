You don't have to say you're sorry  
We all make mistakes, I've made my share, Oh.  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
I don't need those words to know you care.  
  
Explanations aren't required even though you think you should  
I don't need to know the reasons, No, not even if they're good  
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would  
  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
and that's a silly game that children play, oh  
You don't have to say you're sorry, no  
No, you shouldn't have to live that way  
  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
Cause we're both too old it's true  
Well they say when you love someone, forgiveness is the rule  
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would  
  
Explanations aren't required, even though you think you should  
I don't need to know the reasons  
No, not even if they're good  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
But I sure do wish you would, I wish you would
