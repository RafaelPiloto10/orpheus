Tremble you weaklings,cower in fear  
I am your ruler,land,sea and air  
Immense in my girth,erect I stand tall  
I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris  
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button  
My system locked in on military gluttons  
  
I rule on land,air and sea  
Pass judgment on humanity  
Winds blow from the bowels of hell  
Will we give warning,only time will tell  
Satan rears his ugly head,to spit into the wind  
  
I spread disease like a dog  
Discharge my payload a mile high  
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils  
Launch the Polaris,the end doesn't scare us  
  
When will this cease  
The warheads will all rust in peace  
Bomb shelters filled to the brim  
Survival such a silly whim  
World leaders sell missiles cheap  
Your stomach turns,your flesh creeps  
  
High priest of holocaust,fire from the sea  
Nuclear winter spreading disease  
The day of final conflict  
All pay the price  
The third world war  
Rapes peace,takes life  
Back to the start,talk of the part  
When the earth was cold as ice  
Total dismay as the sun passed away  
And the days where black as night  
  
Eradication of earth's  
Population loves Polaris
