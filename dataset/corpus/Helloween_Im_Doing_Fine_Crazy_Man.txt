(m - grosskopf, l - kiske)  
  
Thunder, flash and lightning  
Is working on my back  
The tables in the kitchen  
Are tryin' to break my neck  
  
All the late night memories  
Are leaning in my shoes  
My mother's old grey  
Leather gloves are singing loud the blues  
  
I can taste what's in the sun  
No time to waste 'cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still it's true I'm doin' fine  
  
You can't see me  
'cause now I'm all free  
Now you know I'm through  
An' all that's not new  
  
Sitting on a paperback  
'cause I don't know what really cracks  
I'm trying to climb my pencil  
To get high  
  
No one tells me what to do  
'cause no one knows what I've been through  
You don't know a thing  
But you can learn  
  
It's time to touch the sky  
My mind is free I fly  
  
I can taste what's in the sun  
No time to waste 'cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still it's true I'm doin' fine  
  
You can't see me  
'cause now I'm all free  
Now you know I'm through  
An' all that's not new
