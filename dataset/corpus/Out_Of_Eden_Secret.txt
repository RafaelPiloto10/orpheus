Chorus:  
Why is that smile upon your face  
When it's such a rainy day  
Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say
