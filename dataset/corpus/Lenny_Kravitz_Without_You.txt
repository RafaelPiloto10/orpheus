The sun is shining  
But I don't feel the rays  
The boats are sailing  
But I don't want to play  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
  
I live life in luxury  
But I believe it's a crime  
When you can't enjoy it  
And all the time cry  
  
Or maybe some kind of spell  
'Cause it feels like a curse  
When there's so much water  
But all the time thirst  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
  
My mind is a courthouse  
My soul is a jail  
My life is on death row  
'Cause you are not there  
  
I need a pardon  
I can't stand the pain  
What I'd do for your love now,  
If there's love to regain  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you
