(J. Brooks)  
Oh Betty  
You know I loved you so  
I'm shattered  
It hurt so much to see you go  
Give me your heart, I'll keep it beating  
And your blood will spill no more  
Oh I want to love you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
Oh Betty  
Don't tell heaven where you've been  
Don't you know that needing love is not a sin  
Give me your soul, I'll be it's keeper  
And the words I speak will be yours  
Oh I try to hate you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
And the leaves are starting to fall from the trees again  
And I remember when  
And autumn wind sang a song of a sin  
But I wasn't ready  
Oh Betty  
Oh Betty  
Don't tell heaven where you've been  
Didn't you know that needing love is not a sin  
Give me your heart, I'll keep it beating  
And your blood will spill no more  
Oh I want to love you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
You closed the greatest of doors
