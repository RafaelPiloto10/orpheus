Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
In flames our prophet witches  
Be polite  
A room full of glasses  
He says "Your notches liberation doll"  
And he chains me with that serpent  
To that Ethiopian wall  
  
Anima rising  
Queen of Queens  
Wash my guilt of Eden  
Wash and balance me  
Anima rising  
Uprising in me tonight  
She's a vengeful little goddess  
With an ancient crown to fight  
  
Truth goes up in vapors  
The steeples lean  
Winds of change patriarchs  
Snug in your bible belt dreams  
God goes up the chimney  
Like childhood Santa Claus  
The good slaves love the good book  
A rebel loves a cause  
  
I'm leaving on the 1:15  
You're darn right  
Since I was seventeen  
I've had no one over me  
He says "Anima rising-  
So what-  
Petrified wood process  
Tall timber down to rock!"  
  
Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
He says "We walked on the moon  
You be polite."  
Don't let up the sorrow  
Death and birth and death and birth  
He says "Bring that bottle kindly  
And I'll pad your purse-  
I've got a head full of quandary  
And a mighty, mighty, thirst."  
  
Seventeen glasses  
Rhine wine  
Milk of the Madonna  
Clandestine  
He don't let up the sorrow  
He lies and he cheats  
It takes a heart like Mary's these days  
When your man gets weak
