Hey there cutes,  
Put on your dancin' boots  
And come, dance with me  
Come dance with me  
What an evenin' for  
Some terpsichore  
  
Pretty face  
I know a swingin' place  
Come on, dance with me  
Romance with me on a crowded floor  
  
And while the rhythm swings what lovely things I'll be sayin'  
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love set to music, playin'  
  
When the band Begins to leave the stand,  
And folks start to roam  
As we walk home, Cheek to cheek we'll be  
So come on, come on, come on come on  
And dance with me  
  
Hey there's sweets  
Throw on those Latin beats  
And come dance with me  
What I mean is, come on and my let's cha-cha-cha  
  
And leave your sweat and do the bango beat  
Come on, dance with me  
Romance with me uh, la, la la la la  
I don't care what it has  
'Cause that jargon jazz makes me move it  
  
And we charade when the band starts to groove it,  
They groove it  
Come on by, 'cause we're set to fly  
And I'll let you lead  
  
If that's agreed, you'll know where I'll be  
So come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come and dance with me  
I'll do the cha-cha-cha, uh, the merengue  
We'll grow the tango  
Come on and dance with me
