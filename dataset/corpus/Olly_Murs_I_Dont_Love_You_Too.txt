It's the morning after last night  
I got in late and you were up for a fight  
Oh I brought up some things that you didn't like  
You said get out, I said that I just might  
  
Sometimes I feel like we're not gonna make it  
Sometimes we act like we really hate this  
But we couldn't replace this  
  
Let's face it, it's true  
Yeah, we can both be cruel  
Yeah, we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you, you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I don't love you too  
I don't love you too  
I don't love you too  
You know I do  
  
Why is it when we fight that you look your best  
I know it's hot but could you wear any less  
Well I won't be there so who you trying to impress  
You're making damn sure that I don't have to guess  
Sometimes I swear that we just wanna break  
Sometimes I swear that we're not gonna take it  
Yeah I might as well face it  
We might as well face it  
  
It's true  
Yeah, we can both be cruel  
Yeah, we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you, you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I don't love you too  
  
We play the roles  
Yeah, we put on a show  
Both of us act like we're ready to let go  
But I know I miss it all  
And it's too far to fall  
  
You know it's true  
Yeah, we can both be cruel  
Yeah, we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you, you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I don't love you too  
I don't love you too  
I don't love you too  
But I do, you know I do yeah yeah  
You know that I woah-oh-oh  
You know that I woah-oh-oh  
You know that I do, I do love you.
