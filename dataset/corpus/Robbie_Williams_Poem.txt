Hello sir, remember me?  
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.  
The boy who you reduced to tears,  
The lad called "thingy" for six whole years.  
Yeah that's right, my names bob,  
The one who landed the popstars job.  
The one who you told: "Look don't touch"  
The Kid who wouldn'y amount to much.  
Well I'm here, and you're still there  
With your fake sports car and receding hair  
Dodgy, farout trousers that you think are smart  
Married to the woman that teaches art  
Married to the life  
Married to the school  
"I want to sing and dance sir"  
Now who's the fool?  
Sing and dance, you thought I was balmy  
"Settle down thingy, join the army"  
And who were you to tell me this  
The dream I want I'll have to miss  
Sir is god, he's been given the right  
To structure lives overnight.  
Now I know life's true path,  
Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh.  
Nah, not me, I'm a mega civillian  
I won't leave my life riding pillion  
But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do  
For the negitive dickheads just like you.  
As for now the different weapon  
Stage and screen is about to beckon  
And here I sit in first class  
Bollocks sir, kiss my ass.
