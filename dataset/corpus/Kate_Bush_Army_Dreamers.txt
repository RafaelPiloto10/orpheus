"B.F.P.O."  
Army dreamers  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
"Mammy's hero"  
  
Our little army boy  
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.  
I've a bunch of purple flowers  
To decorate a mammy's hero  
  
Mourning in the aerodrome  
The weather warmer, he is colder  
Four men in uniform  
To carry home my little soldier  
  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a rock star"  
But he didn't have the money for a guitar  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a politician"  
But he never had a proper education  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a father"  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
  
Tears o'er a tin box  
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know  
Like a chicken with a fox  
He couldn't win the war with ego  
  
Give the kid the pick of pips  
And give him all your stripes and ribbons  
Now he's sitting in his hole  
He might as well have buttons and bows  
  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a rock star"  
But he didn't have the money for a guitar  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a politician"  
But he never had a proper education  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a father"  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of all that  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers, oh  
  
"B.F.P.O."  
Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum  
Army dreamers  
Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
Army Dreamers  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
No harm heroes  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
Army dreamers.  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
No harm heroes
