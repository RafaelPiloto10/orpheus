Sailing along  
The river of time  
Adrift on dreams  
Through midnight chimes  
Positively frozen  
Crystal Waterfalls  
The mountain of hope  
Is there to be climbed  
The sea of serenity  
Is rightfully mine  
Step on to the water  
Knowing what is true  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows for the rain  
  
The beat of my heart  
The rhythm of love  
The earth that's beneath us  
The heavens above  
I can hear forever  
Calling out to me  
The changes we go though  
Are making me strong  
The shelter of friendship  
Is where we belong  
Look into the future  
Knowing what we see  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows for the rain  
  
The whirlpool of doubt  
Can spin you around  
The wave of emotion  
Takes you up  
Pulls you down  
Leaving far behind us  
Sweet young passions spray  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows  
Never blame the rainbows  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain
