No future they say  
But must it be that way?  
Now is calling  
The city is human  
  
[Chorus :]  
Blind youth take hope  
You're no Joe Soap  
Your time is due  
Big fun come soon  
We've had it easy, we should be glad  
High-rise living's not so bad  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Dehumanisation  
Is such a big word  
It's been around since  
Richard The Third  
Dehumanisation  
It's easy to say  
But if you're not a hermit  
You know the city's OK  
No future they say  
But must it be that way  
Now is calling  
The city is human  
  
(Repeat chorus twice)  
We've had it easy, we should be glad  
High-rise living's not so bad  
  
(Repeat chorus three times)
