Hands in line  
Arms close to my side  
I'm fighting tides of an ocean's undertow  
And I figure I might not make it  
And I'm taking empty  
But seldom keeping  
And the words retreat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.  
  
My hands are high  
And I'm holding out, holding up  
Because I figure that I just might make it  
And I'm waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.  
  
Quality is what you see now in the corner of your eye.  
Don't be surprised if you hear the bells ring  
They form from the sky and they sound bong, bong, bong  
And I'm holding up because I figure that I just make it.  
  
And I'm waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.
