Ooh I'd like to tell you something that's playing on my mind  
I don't know how to tell you, so I'll take my time  
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind  
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time  
There's no escape - I don't want to be free  
I believe that it must be love  
Having trouble sleeping, you're always on my mind  
When it comes to dreamin' I get left behind  
I believe, I believe there's no doubt in my mind  
There's no use pretending I'm hooked on your line  
Words of the heart don't come easy to me  
I believe that it must be love  
You got me tied to a railroad track  
Your love's the train - there's no turning it back  
I've told you how I feel, I've laid it on the line  
Got to take your love and make you feel that you're mine  
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind  
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time  
There's no escape - I don't want to be free  
I believe that it must be love  
It must be love  
It must be love yeah etc..
