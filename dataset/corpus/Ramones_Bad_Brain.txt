I used to be an A student  
I never used to complain  
I used to be a truant  
But I'm still the same  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain  
  
I used to go to parties  
I used to drink champagne  
Now I'm beginning to feel the strain  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain  
  
I used to be in show biz  
I used to have fortune and fame  
I used to have pleasure and pain  
I used to have a name  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain  
  
Now I'm on the Bowery  
I can't remember my name  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain
