I guess I'll get a cab and go by in my house today  
  
No I can't visit her or my son I'm supposed to stay away  
  
But it won't hurt to bring back old memories  
  
Cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
Now there's our car the one that I'm still payin' for  
  
And in the front yard Lord I see my little boy  
  
And there's his mother I hope she's doing fine  
  
Oh Lord I'd give anything if they were all still mine  
  
But they're not and I'm the one to blame  
  
I should have known I'd never win when I played that cheating game  
  
This other man holds my life and my son calls him daddy tonight  
  
But how can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
How can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me
