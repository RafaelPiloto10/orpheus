I used to think that I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the ever lasting arms  
  
If I can see it  
Then I can do it  
If I just believe it  
There's nothing to it  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes the silence could seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first it's got to start inside of me  
  
If I can see it  
Then I can do it  
If I just believe it  
There's nothing to it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuz I believe in me, yea,yea,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh  
  
If I can see it  
  
Then I can do it  
  
If I just believe it  
  
There's nothing to it, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe I can fly(I can fly)  
I believe I can fly(I can fly)  
I believe I can fly(I can fly)  
I can do anything yea, yea, yea. yea  
I can fly  
I can do anything, yea, yea, yea  
  
Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)  
Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)  
Anything I wanna do(Anything I wanna do)  
I can do anything  
I can fly
