Someday, rested from hours of sleeping  
We'll stay safely behind what we're keeping  
You'll seem warmer than I had remembered you  
Lying so close I'll be able to feel you breathe  
I could never leave  
  
One day, when I am able to love you  
I'll come back from wherever I've been to  
I'll see you looking the same as you always have  
Lovely, so lovely, I'll cling to the love you give  
So I'll start to live  
  
Someday is coming  
If I believe it  
Someday always brings the good life you knew  
Ever back to you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
How I need you  
Someday, all I can give you is someday  
Someday, all I can offer is someday  
Please say that you'll be waiting when someday comes  
Promise me this and a kiss, to keep what you are  
Always close to me
