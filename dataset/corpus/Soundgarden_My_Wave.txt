Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Break, if you like the sound  
If it gets you up  
If it brings you down  
  
Share, if it makes you sleep  
If it sets you free  
If it helps to breath  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Pray, if you want to pray  
If you like to kneel  
If you like to lay  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave
