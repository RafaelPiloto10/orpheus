Somebody's been lyin'  
Somebody's been callin' me tellin' me he still loves me  
But not the way I thought it would be  
He's makin' fun of me and laughin' at my dreams  
And I know that he keeps...  
Sayin' not to worry  
He's tellin' me to just hold on  
But he's not here to learn on  
And words won't warm my bed now he's gone  
It isn't easy letting go of what we had  
And I guess I'm just scared  
And I still believe him though  
I'd be wiser to go on my own way  
Somebody's been lyin'  
And I know you're tellin' me only the things you want to  
I guess I lie as much as you do  
It seems so funny letting go of yesterday  
Guess we're much too afraid and we're much too alone  
Were we just too much in love
