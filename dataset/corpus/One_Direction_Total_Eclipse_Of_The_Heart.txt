Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and  
You're never coming round  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of  
Listening to the sound of my tears  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that  
The best of all the years have gone by  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified  
And then I see the look in your eyes  
Nial y Louis:  
(Turn around, bright eyes)

Every now and then I fall apart

(Turn around, bright eyes)

Every now and then I fall apart  
  
Todos:  
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever  
And if you only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never  
Be wrong  
Together we can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
  
(Niall: all of the time)  
  
Todos:  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Louis y Liam:  
Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only  
Falling apart  
  
Zayn:  
There's nothing I can do... A total eclipse of the heart
