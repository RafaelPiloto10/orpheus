Trenchtown Jamaica  
Gave the Wailers their soun'  
Like a steppin' razor  
The Brother Tosh 'im come aroun'  
Yellow Man and Eek-A-Mouse  
Dem a trod 'pon newer groun'  
While Scratch and The Scientist  
Dem jus' keep on mixin' down.  
  
The mighty General and Eastwood  
Draw me out of my seat  
The Lone Ranger ride in  
To rock me' pon me feet  
The dreaded Flabba Holt and Style Scott  
Start fe put down a radical beat  
Wid Mistra Isaacs  
Puttin' melodies so sweet.  
  
Ad lib.......  
Refrain:  
Reggae music is  
The key to ny heart  
Reggae music is  
My stop and start  
From dusk to dawn  
The music is my high.
