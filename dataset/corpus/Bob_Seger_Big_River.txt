Life is like a big river  
  
Sinkin' or swim, depends on you  
you can take or you can be a giver  
you're gonna get through  
Once, a good woman loved me  
If you got love  
  
Kinda cruel, and she left me one day  
now I'm cyin', she loves another  
gotta go alone  
The rest of the way  
  
Take, the advice of a loser  
who's been livin' too long alone  
Follow your heart  
  
follow your rainbow  
And one day you'll find  
You are not alone
