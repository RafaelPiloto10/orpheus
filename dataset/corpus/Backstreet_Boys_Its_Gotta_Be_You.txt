Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
  
I can't control it anymore  
I've never felt like this before  
you really make me lose my head  
My hungry heart must be fed (uh huh, uh huh)  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
[Chorus]  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
All the way  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
Everyday  
I promise you I will be true, yeah  
It's only you  
  
Now I know why I was born  
You feel my feelings one by one  
Can't see the world I'm walking through  
'Cause baby I see only you, oh yeah  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
And you know  
I can't see the world I'm walking through  
'Cause of you, yeah  
It's gotta be you, all the way  
All that I ever wanted  
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah  
It's only you  
  
[Chorus]
