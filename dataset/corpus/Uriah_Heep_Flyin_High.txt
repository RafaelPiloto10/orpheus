I'm flyin' high  
And I know the reason why  
'Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey, as I love you  
  
I used to think  
That love was all so strange  
There was something  
That I used to ease the pain  
Though at times  
It seems it hurts to touch  
It's never gonna hurt  
As much as no love at all  
Honey, as no love at all  
  
Flyin' high, it's a crazy feeling  
Flyin' high, 'cause  
I've learnt the meaning of love  
Flyin' high it's a crazy feeling  
Flyin' high 'cause I believe in love  
  
I'm flyin' high  
And I guess I know the reason why  
'Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey, as I love you  
  
I'm flyin high  
I'm flyin', flyin', flyin'  
I'm flyin high  
And I know the reason
