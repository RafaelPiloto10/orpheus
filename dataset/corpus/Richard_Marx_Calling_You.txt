I had a dream that you stood right in front of me  
And called to me in black and white  
Though I could see you  
I couldn't reach you  
You faded into the light  
And when the sun turns a dream to reality  
I'm left with such an empty space  
I feel your spirit  
Know that I'm near it  
I swear I can see your face  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just don't seem to answer anymore  
  
Am I supposed to pretend I don't feel the pain  
Like it happened only yesterday  
No use in trying  
To stop the crying  
I can't make it go away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just don't seem to answer anymore  
I'm calling you  
Calling you  
And I'm afraid that you won't answer anymore  
  
Where is the healing you promised me  
Maybe this feeling will burn in me forever  
  
[Chorus]
