I wrapped you inside my coat  
When they came to fire upon the house  
I didn't feel pain  
Cause no one can touch me  
Now that I'm held in your smile  
  
A beautiful girl  
A beautiful girl  
Can turn your world into doubt  
Sell me a car that goes  
Sell me a house that stands  
Oh  
I never cared before  
I never cared before  
I never cared before  
Before  
Before  
Before  
  
A beautiful girl  
A beautiful girl  
Can turn your world into doubt  
A beautiful girl  
A beautiful girl  
Can turn you world into doubt  
Yeah  
I stood in front of her face  
When the first bullet  
Was shot
