What would you say  
If I asked you to stay with me forever  
But forever's in too soon  
The touch of your hand  
And the look in your eyes are the only things I know  
I know that are true  
  
We only have this life  
To forgive and forget  
But the only thing that matters  
Is we have no regrets  
  
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't give to you  
You know it's true  
Oh can't you see  
You're the last love for me  
  
Time passes fast  
And the hours go quickly  
But the fire inside our hearts  
It never dies  
The sound of your voice  
And the way that it moves me in a special way  
Oh I can't describe  
  
Please take my hand  
And we'll walk the endless road  
No one has to lead us  
'Cause we know which way to go  
  
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't give to you  
You know it's true  
Oh can't you see  
You're the last love for me  
  
And if I ever really hurt you  
How sorry I would be  
There's something I've been trying to tell you  
Darlin' it's time you know  
You'll always be a part of me
