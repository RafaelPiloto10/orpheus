Roxie.  
Sometimes I'm right  
Sometimes I'm wrong  
But he doesn't care  
He'll string along  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
Sometimes I'm down  
Sometimes I'm up  
But he follows 'round  
Like some droopy-eyed pup  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
  
He ain't no sheik  
That's no great physique  
Lord knows, he ain't got the smarts  
  
But look at that soul  
I tell you that whole  
Is a whole lot greater  
Than the sum of his parts  
  
And if you knew him like me  
I know you'd agree  
  
What if the world  
Slandered my name?  
Why, he'd be right there  
Taking the blame  
  
He loves me so  
And it all suits me fine  
That funny, sunny, honey  
Hubby of mine!  
  
(dialog)  
  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine!  
  
(dialog)  
He loves me so  
That funny honey , of mine!!  
  
(dialog)  
  
Lord knows  
He ain't got the smarts  
  
(dialog)  
  
Now he's shot of his trap  
I can't stand that  
Sap  
  
Look at him go  
rattin' on me  
With just one more  
Brain  
What a half-wit  
He'd be  
  
If they string me  
Up  
I'll know who  
Brought the  
Twine  
  
That scummy,  
Crummy  
Dummy hubby of  
Mine
