Blue skies, smilin' at me  
Nothin' but blue skies do I see  
Blue birds singin' a song  
Nothin' but blue birds all day long!  
  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never say things goin' so right  
Noticin' the days hurryin' by  
When you're in love, my, my how they fly!  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on!  
  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never say things goin' so right  
Noticin' the days hurryin' by  
When you're in love, my, my how they fly!  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on!
