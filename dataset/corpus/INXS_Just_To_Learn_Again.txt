Back in time where fear can't climb  
Warm and safe with a nursery rhyme  
They will put your feet in very hot water  
With your senses in a cloud you  
Make them rich and very proud  
  
All those years of learning  
Just to learn again  
  
No talk of love or jungle law  
The tender heart we will ignore  
And once again and once too often  
The mislead aims of twisted teachers  
Turns your life and face and features  
  
I've come to see your honesty  
Of ideal plans and security  
Softly the voices are speaking to me  
Your fault, son, that you've been done  
Now your lessons have just begun
