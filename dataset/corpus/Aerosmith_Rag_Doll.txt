Rag doll, livin' in a movie  
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie  
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, mam  
Hot time get it while it's easy  
Don't mind come on up and see me  
Rag doll baby won't you do me like you done before  
I'm feelin' like a bad boy  
Mm just a like a bad boy  
I'm rippin' up a Rag Doll  
Like throwin' away an old toy  
Some babe's talkin' real loud  
Talkin' all about the new crowd  
Try and tell me of an old dream  
A new version of the old scene  
Speak easy on the grape vine  
Keep shufflin' in a shoe shine  
Old tin lizzy do it till you're dizzy  
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
