[P. Diddy]  
1, 2, 1, 2  
Yeh why'all can hear me  
Make the drumming sound yeh  
Lets ride yeh yeh  
Be clear we here lights out  
Eat here sleep here my house  
Rhyme wasting time wasting  
Feds want me caged in  
Hope they got patience  
More you win they want you to lose  
I don't floss no more I drop jewels  
Hope we might chill the heights real  
Still we got fire that will melt your ice grill  
Know the deal once we hit record  
Hit the floor  
New era this is war  
Lord I'm the answer without a question  
No evidence no possession  
Stop stressing  
Shit I got moves to make  
Streets is dark but still I illuminate nigga  
I could see the way  
Till I see the end to me and BIG meet again yeh  
  
[Mark Curry]  
Curry going hit again  
Dreams your living in  
This what you coulda been  
Every city foot scene gets scrilla with em  
Kid shortchange the dealer  
The game be gorilla  
Ain't nothing illa  
Aka 800 toll free aside  
I rose to be a Bad Boy til' I die  
The official bonafide (fide)  
Tested and tried (tried)  
Get in like Canson  
Work from the inside  
When I ride eyes are wide  
Ain't that I lick when I walk  
My some pimping to my stride  
Some wit a emphis on my side  
Cause I understand niggas out to get I  
Living the life  
Is no lie  
Been a great thing to do  
Nuttin I could think change the view  
Although it might seem strange to you  
Its plain to me  
I'm here with you  
Lets give them what they came to see  
  
[Big Azz Ko]  
Yow yow aiiyo  
We exceptional  
Congressional  
Its best that you bester crew  
Wit your flesh going bruise  
Blood goin ooze and  
However you choose your ass goin lose  
This ain't the blues  
Don't things that cruise  
Go bring the news  
Wit flows meaning cruel  
From few options  
To cruise hopping  
Now fools plotting cause I chart topping  
From bounce checks to being in effect (fect)  
And it don't stop till they reinterbect  
Rhyme calisthetics  
Bad Boy anesthetics  
Will twist me like crippie  
Amanda Chevitts  
Back flips tactics  
Be on measure  
Hat tricks wit only dimes and better  
Nigga just for that cheddar  
O please I switch cheese to leather  
  
[Loon]  
Uh yeh uh yeh uh  
Check it out yo  
Why'all niggas say what why'all want to say  
Feel how why'all want to feel  
Who give a fuck dog kill who you want to kill  
Just keep it real when it come to me  
'cause all my niggas in the slums kinda hungary  
On my right where my gun going be  
Bitches ain't getting a crumb from me  
Member when niggas used to run from me  
All of a sudden niggas names is buzzing  
Nigga in the game got a little chain becuz  
Heard the nigga signed a major budget  
But I'm the nigga made you love  
Now you want to change the subject  
I ain't sweating that animosity  
I'm deading that  
Instead of rap imma smack you dead in your trap  
I don't give a fuck what I said on a track  
Niggas know me better than that  
Niggas I could neva be wack  
My money way to ahead of you cats  
I'm going strait to the top where the cheddar be at  
Wassup wit that  
Yeh bad boy nigga  
Fuck why'all want to do  
  
[P. Diddy]  
As why'all can see when have come to the end of our program  
Very important that I let why'all know  
That I truly appreciate and I'm thankful  
For all your support  
For everybody that's been down from day one
