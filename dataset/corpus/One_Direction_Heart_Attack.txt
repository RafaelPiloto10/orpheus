Baby, you got me sick  
I don't know what I did  
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah  
  
Got your voice in my head  
Saying let's just be friends  
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Baby, now that you're gone  
I can't stand dumb love songs  
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah  
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see  
How you messed me up, I'm better off now  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Every time you look like that  
You're giving me a heart attack  
'Cause seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
You're all I ever wanted  
Every time you look like that  
You're all I ever wanted  
You're giving me a heart attack
