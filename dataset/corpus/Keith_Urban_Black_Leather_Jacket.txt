I wore a black leather jacket way back in high school  
And man, lookin back at these pictures of us, we were so cool  
You were so hot in your pink lipstick  
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette  
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you  
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you  
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static  
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night  
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight  
You wore it in the stands at the football games  
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name  
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you grew up, I grew up, too  
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too  
Thank God they look like you  
  
And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you  
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you  
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static  
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
Well, there's nothin in the world makes me feel more alive  
When its just you and me and the moon is high  
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine  
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes  
  
Two kids just fallin in love  
And here we are right now, good heavens above  
Its only gettin better, baby  
Its only getting better, baby  
I just love that black, leather jacket
