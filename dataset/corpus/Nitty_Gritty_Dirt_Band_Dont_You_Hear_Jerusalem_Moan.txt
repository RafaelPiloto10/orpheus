Don't You Hear Jerusalem Moan  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't never let a chicken get big enough to crow  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Thank God there's a heaven and a ringing in my soul and my soul's got free  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Well a hard-shell preacher you can tell him how he do  
Well he chews his own tobacco and he drinks his own brew.  
Well a Baptist preacher you can tell him by his coat  
Has a bottle in his pocket that he can't hardly tote  
Well a Cambellite preacher his soul is saved  
Well he has to be baptized every other day  
Well the Holy Roller preacher he sure is a sight  
Well he gets em all a-rolling and he kicks out the light  
Well the Presbyterian preacher he lives in town  
His neck's so stiff he can't hardly look around.
