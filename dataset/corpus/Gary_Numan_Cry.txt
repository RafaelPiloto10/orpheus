I don't cry  
Or forget  
I'll cut my picture on your heart  
No names  
You've got one more game to lose  
  
I was young  
I was clean  
But now my soul eats me alive  
I was kind  
Now I'm your first big mistake  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
She sold pain  
She sold mine  
She sold my secret to the man  
She sold lies  
And so now I break the word  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Tear up my picture  
Tear up my face  
You'll tear up your feelings but the memory's quite safe  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back and cry  
Look up my number if you want to know why  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Same need  
Same cure  
I'll whisper words to ease your shame  
Play time  
I've got one more trick for you  
  
I don't pray  
Wrong man  
I don't look for love that I don't need  
Wrong place  
You've got one more chance to leave
