Oh I know  
Things are gonna change  
The only thing for certain  
Is that nothing stays the same  
But all I want  
Is love from you  
Give me your hand  
To hold on to  
And if tears fill your eyes  
Come on listen to my music it's no surprise  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna be famous in life  
I don't wanna be famous in the world  
I just wanna be famous  
Famous  
I wanna be famous in your heart  
  
Oh I know  
The wind is gonna blow  
And in the winter  
There's sure to be snow  
But with the warmth of your smile  
And the sun of your face  
Shine on me in the darkness  
With your love and grace  
And if time hides my eyes  
Listen to my music and recognize  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if time hides my eyes  
Listen to my music  
Listen to my music and recognize  
  
I don't wanna be famous in life  
(I don't wanna be famous)  
I don't wanna be famous in the world  
I just wanna be famous  
Famous  
I wanna be famous in your heart
