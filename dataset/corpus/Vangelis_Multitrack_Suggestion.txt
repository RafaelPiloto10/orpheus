Years passing by  
VCO  
VCA  
And again  
And again  
Years passing by  
Let her go  
Let her stay  
In the memory's place  
  
Gets a machine  
VCO  
VCA  
Get the tape  
Get the bass  
  
One hundred plus one  
Multitrack  
Patch bay, patch bay  
  
EQ low cut  
Free post  
Frequency one thousand  
  
La da, da, da  
VCO  
VCA  
In the memory's place  
We let them pay  
VCO  
VCA  
I am no techno-guy  
The live...  
One hundred plus one  
Multitrack  
Patch bay, patch bay  
EQ low cut
