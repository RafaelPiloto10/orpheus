Fell in love with a beautiful girl  
With a beautiful girl that I've never  
seen  
She told me to be strong  
Someone I loved fell behind  
I tried to hold on but I'm not strong  
Cause she told me she told me  
I'm speechless I'm out of control  
  
[Chorus]  
Hallelujah to my Mama  
Hallelujah she's in heaven  
Hallelujah to my Mama  
She's in heaven, heaven  
  
Took my pride and my job away  
I had a choice to leave or stay  
And I stayed yes I stayed now  
Took my choice and fought like a dog  
Took the chance and now I'm back  
And I made it cause she told me  
I'm speechless it's in the name of  
mom  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won't let go too easy  
I won't let go too easy  
Cause I know  
I know now  
Cause we know  
We know now  
  
[Chorus]
