Rocky mountain Christmas and Christmas like a lullaby  
Oh holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
'Til he appeared and the soul felt  
Its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and  
Glorious morn.  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the  
Angel voices.  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
Oh holy night  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the  
Angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
Oh holy night
