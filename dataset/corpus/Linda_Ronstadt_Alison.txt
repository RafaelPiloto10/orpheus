Well it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl  
Ah but the way you look I understand that you are not impressed  
But I heard you let that little friend of mine  
Take off your party dress  
I'm not gonna get too sentimental like those other sticky valentines  
'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody  
I only hope he wasn't mine  
  
Alison, I know this world is killing you  
Oh Alison, my aim is true  
  
Well I see you've got a husband now  
Well did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake  
You used to hold him right in your hand  
Ah but he took all he could take  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking  
When I hear the silly things that you say  
I think somebody better put out the big light  
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way  
  
Alison, I know this world is killing you  
Oh Alison, my aim is true  
My aim is true  
My aim is true  
My aim is true
