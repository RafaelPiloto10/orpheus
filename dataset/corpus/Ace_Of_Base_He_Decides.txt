Can't you hear them whispering  
Around you all the time  
Can't you tell the difference between  
Things when you're in love  
I hear your voice is trembling  
Every time when he's around  
Your detached engagements  
In the things I say means love, oh  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
If he doesn't love you, you're afraid that you  
Can't go on  
Living without loving never makes a person  
Strong, no  
If he really loves you, let him show you that  
Instead  
I will be here with you 'cause I know that  
You're afraid of love  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
You'll never change my mind my friend, don't  
Let that feeling go  
This love might change your world around  
In time you'll have to know, oh yeah  
  
Whether you should go  
  
Oh yeah  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
Whether you should be happy  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
  
He decides  
Whether you  
  
I know that  
He decides
