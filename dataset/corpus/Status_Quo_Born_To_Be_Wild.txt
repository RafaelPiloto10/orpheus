Get your motor runnin'  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin' for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah darlin', go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin' with the wind  
And the feelin' that I'm under  
Yeah Darlin' gonna make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
Like a true nature's child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild
