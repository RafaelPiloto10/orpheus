[Elton John]  
Feet are feeling light  
Head on out to see the sights  
Ain't life a many splendored thing?  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Ducking up and down  
All these crazy sights and sounds  
Bounce around like puppets on a string  
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind  
Famous last lines of a fool  
  
[Elton John]  
Just when you think  
You're a chain with just one link  
Something comes to tip you off your stool  
  
[Both]  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
My my my, what have we here?  
What a surprise  
What a surprise!  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Hello, Hello  
Hello, Hello  
I'm not alone it's good to know  
  
[Elton John]  
Someone's out there to say hello  
  
[Both]  
Hello!  
  
[Elton John]  
Do a dizzy dance  
Twirl around and take a chance  
Nothing's easy  
Nothing comes for free  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Sniffing on a flower  
Run through an autumn shower  
  
[Both]  
I'm better off with someone else like me  
  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
Oh my my, what have we here?  
What a surprise  
What a surprise!  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Hello, Hello  
Hello, Hello  
I'm not alone it's good to know  
  
[Elton John]  
Someone's out there to say hello, hello  
  
[Both]  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
Oh my my, what have we here?  
What a surprise  
What a surprise!  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Hello, Hello  
Hello, Hello  
I'm not alone it's good to know  
  
[Elton John]  
Someone dropped right in to say hello  
  
[Both]  
Hello Hello  
Hello hello  
  
[Elton John]  
Oh my my, what have we here?  
What a surprise  
What a surprise!  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
Hello, Hello  
Hello, Hello  
I'm not alone it's good to know  
  
[Elton John]  
Someone dropped right in to say hello  
  
[Both]  
Hello!  
Hello!  
Hello
