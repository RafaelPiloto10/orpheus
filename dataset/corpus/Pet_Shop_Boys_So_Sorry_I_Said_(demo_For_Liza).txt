If this is a ghetto, I'm in it with you  
If it's just a prison, I'm locked in it too  
I tried to leave you, but after all that we had said  
I went to pieces when I should have shouted and screamed  
instead:  
So sorry, I said  
Your powers of persuasion, those quizzical eyes  
Have tired and tied me, with innocent guile  
I would have walked out, and after all the tears we shed  
I should have stalked out, gone and painted the town bright  
red  
But instead  
So sorry, I said  
How tough it gets, don't talk to me about it!  
To pay off your debts, I worked on overtime  
And you say you never believed in luck  
If you need a reason, consider me mad  
An old retainer, loyal and sad  
I bought my freedom, but after all that we had shared  
I couldn't leave you think of the skins I'd have to shed  
instead  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said
