Here we are trying to mend all the broken hearts  
In a world where the pain is the fear  
Ain't no doubt there's a method to madness here  
Set your clock to the start of a brand new year  
  
Shine your heart to the universe and get the news  
Not alone never have been, never will be  
See the truth, not to mention the promise made  
See them all, see them all high on judar rhythm  
  
We began at the very first spring  
How the promise will come when the promise is made  
We will sing at the very first spring  
That the promise will come when the promise is made  
Promise is made, promise is made  
  
Shake me up, take me up  
Face to face  
  
Lift me up, shake me up  
Face to face  
  
Make me real, make me longing to see you smile  
Shall we dancing, shall we be the dancing down under  
In this life of lives, are we ready to take the chance  
Moving to the rhythm, here at last to  
  
Believe  
To believe  
  
We began at the first real spring  
How the promise will come when the promise is made  
We will sing at the very first spring  
That the promise will come when the promise is made  
  
We began at the first real spring, ya  
We will sing at the very first spring, ya  
  
We began at the first real spring  
We will sing at the very first spring  
How the promise will come when the promise is made  
Promise is made, promise is made  
  
We began at the first real spring  
That the promise will come when the promise is made  
We will sing at the very first spring  
That the promise will come when the promise is made  
Promise is made, promise is made  
  
Shake it up, take me up  
Face to face  
Face to face  
Face to face
