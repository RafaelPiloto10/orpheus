East West  
Over the ocean  
Perpetual motion  
Traveling around  
  
No rest  
Singing and playing  
Night out and day in  
Doing the rounds  
  
What a great life this must seem!  
  
Swelled joints  
Everything classy  
Nothing is tacky  
Only the best  
  
Lush girls  
Older and dying  
Sighing and crying  
"This is success!"  
  
What a great life this must seem!  
  
But when I hear your voice  
Singing out  
The Bells Of Home  
Are ringing out  
And I feel all alone  
(And I think of my home)  
  
Cold times  
A wind through the houses  
The bleakness arouses  
A longing to leave  
  
Time flew  
I wanted to see you  
Somehow I could not do  
Because of success  
  
What a strange life this can be!  
  
But when I hear your voice  
Singing out  
The bells of home  
Are ringing out  
And I feel all alone  
(And I think of my home)
