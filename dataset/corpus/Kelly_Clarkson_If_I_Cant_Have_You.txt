Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental  
Won't stay won't last when it's love at first sight  
So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight  
  
Can't breathe can't sleep with some medication  
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations  
I know there's other fish out in the sea  
Not for me  
I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
If I can't have you then I don't want anyone (I don't want anyone)  
If I can't have you then all the damage has been done baby  
You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun (if you wanna have some
fun)  
Think of all the love that you will lose if I can't have you  
  
Heartbeat cold sweat thoughts slipping under  
Can't fight no threat 'cause there's just no use  
One look, no hesitation  
I'm slipping into you  
  
Forgive these eyes these lips you're tasting  
No time to waste on an invitation  
My shame my self control has suffered enough  
Everybody wants to be loved  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer  
They say perfection's always right around the corner  
Could be true  
But if I can't have you  
  
[Chorus]
