I was born under a bad sign, left out in the cold  
I'm a lonely man who knows just what it means to lose control  
But I took all the heartache and turned it to shame  
Now I'm movin', movin' on and I ain't taking the blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't come running to me, I know I've done all I can  
A hard loving woman like you just makes a hard loving man  
So I can say it to you, babe: I'll be a fool for your loving no more  
A fool for your loving no more  
I'm so tired of trying, I always end up crying  
A fool for your loving no more, I'll be a fool for your loving no more  
  
I'm tired of hiding my feelings, you left me lonely too long  
I gave my heart and you tore it apart  
Oh, baby you done me wrong  
  
[Chorus]
