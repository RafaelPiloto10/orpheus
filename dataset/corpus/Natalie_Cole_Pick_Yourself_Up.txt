Pick yourself up, take a deep breath  
Dust yourself off and start all over again.  
Nothings impossible I have found  
For when my chin is on the ground  
I pick myself up, dust myself off and start all over again  
Don't lose your confidence if you slip  
Be grateful for a pleasant trip  
Just pick yourself up and dust yourself off  
Start all over again.  
  
Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won  
You may be sick and tired, but you'll be a man my son.  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again  
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up  
Dust yourself off and start all over again  
Don't lose your confidence if you slip  
Be grateful for a pleasant trip  
Just pick yourself up dust yourself off  
And try to start all over again.  
  
You gotta work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won  
You may be sick and tired, but you're gonna be a man my son.  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again  
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up  
Dust yourself off and have a nice trip  
And start all over again!
