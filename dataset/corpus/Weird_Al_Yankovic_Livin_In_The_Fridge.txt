There's somethin' weird in the fridge today  
I don't know what it is  
Food I can't recognize  
My roommate won't throw a thing away  
I guess it's probably his  
It looks like it's alive...  
  
And livin' in the fridge...livin' in the fridge  
Livin' in the fridge...livin' in the fridge  
  
There's somethin' gross in the fridge today  
It's green and growin' hair  
It's been there since July  
If you can name that object  
In that baggie over there  
Then mister, you're a better man than I  
  
It's livin' in the fridge  
You can't stop the mold from growin'  
Livin' in the fridge  
Can't tell what it is at all  
Livin' in the fridge  
You can't stop the mold from growin'  
Livin' in the fridge  
  
Tell me do you think it should be carbon-dated  
Fumigated or cremated and buried at sea?  
You try to save a little bit of your home cookin'  
Couple weeks later, got a scary-lookin' specimen  
It always happens, my friend  
Again and again and again and again  
  
Somethin' stinks in the fridge today  
And it's been rottin' there all week  
It could be liver cake or woolly mammoth steak  
Well, maybe I should take another peek...  
  
Livin' in the fridge  
You can't stop the mold from growin'  
Livin' in the fridge  
Can't tell what it is at all  
Livin' in the fridge  
You can't stop the mold from growin'  
Livin' in the fridge  
Livin' in the fridge  
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is  
Livin' in the fridge  
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is  
Livin' in the fridge  
Don't know what it is at all  
Livin' in the fridge, yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah
