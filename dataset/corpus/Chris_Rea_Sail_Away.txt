Walk a cold thin line  
In the morning  
Hold the fear inside  
That greets you with the day  
  
I can't go with you now  
I can only watch you now  
As you sail away  
Sail away  
  
I'm going to miss you now  
So much more then I realised  
There's a heavy stone of empty  
Where you once lay  
  
I can't go with you now  
I can only watch you now  
Watch you  
As you sail away  
  
Sail away  
I know you need your freedom  
Sail away  
Cause without it you can't survive  
Be on your way  
Disappear into the distance  
I smile and say  
Sail away  
  
I can't go with you now  
I can only watch you now  
Watch you  
As you sail away
