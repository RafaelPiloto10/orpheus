When you said you were leavin'  
I said here we go again  
I ain't even breakin' even  
In this game I just can't win  
  
The cards are stacked against me  
Your aces beat my twos  
Seems like bad luck travels with me  
Like I was born to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
I quit  
I've had enough of fallin' in and out of love  
I'm done, I'm through, that's it  
If I can't have you, I quit  
  
You were my only sunshine  
In a world of pouring of pouring rain  
So this will be my last time  
I can't go through this again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm done, I'm through, that's it If I can't have you, I quit
