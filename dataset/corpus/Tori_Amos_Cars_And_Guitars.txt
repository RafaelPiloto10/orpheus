If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Restring my wires why'know  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
I swear it seems of late boy  
I've even curved this body to fit your bow  
  
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come  
Come in rhythm  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
  
"Yeah that whip has skirt"  
You said it proud  
Sometimes I'd watch her idle while you'd tune her up  
Me with my silencer on  
You and your crocodile clip  
Me and my alligator pears yeah  
All tricked out for the trip  
That slid into a spin  
  
You say that "I miss you"  
You stop in at my drive-through  
You know who you'll order some some boy  
  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
  
If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Resting my wires why'know  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims
