Drive me home silver eagle.  
Drive me away from last night's news.  
Empty beds, crowds of people.  
Oh, come on, white girl, sing the blues.  
  
Warm mister, hold me like you love me.  
Why don't you make me  
Feel real good for free?  
And if free don't mean for nothin',  
Let's just say this one's on me, yeah!  
  
You know I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
I bought these devil chains.  
My baby wants me home. Can't refuse him.  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
  
Whoa, I need a short vacation,  
Restin' in my baby's arms.  
But the road goes on  
Forever, forever, forever.  
It keeps on going,  
But I'm gone, gone, gone.  
  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
Bought these devil chains.  
Whoa, baby wants me home. Can't refuse him.  
I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
  
Did you like it?  
Was it good?  
Don't it make you want to cry-hi-hi?  
Did you like it?  
Oh! Am I good?  
Is it worth another try-y-y?  
Aaaaaaa!!!!  
  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.
