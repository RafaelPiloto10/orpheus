If I touched myself  
The way you touched me  
If I could hold myself  
The way you held me  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I wouldn't need you  
I wouldn't need you  
No, I wouldn't need you  
To love me  
  
If I could replace  
The things you gave me  
If I could see my face  
Without the tragedy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But I do  
So come back  
Come back  
  
If you could see the way I act  
When I'm alone  
If you could hear my voice crack  
Over the phone  
  
Oh and I need you  
Oh and I need you  
To love me
