I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
Asked the Lord above, have mercy now, save poor Bob if you please  
  
Standin' at the crossroads, tried to flag a ride  
Whee-hee, I tried to flag a ride  
Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by  
  
Standin' at the crossroads, risin' sun goin' down  
Standin' at the crossroads baby, the risin' sun goin' down  
I believe to my soul now, po' Bob is sinkin' down  
  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willie Brown  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willie Brown  
That I got the crossroad blues this mornin', Lord, baby I'm sinkin' down  
  
I went to the crossroad, mama, I looked east and west  
I went to the crossroad, babe, I looked east and west  
Lord, I didn't have no sweet woman, ooh well, babe, in my distress
