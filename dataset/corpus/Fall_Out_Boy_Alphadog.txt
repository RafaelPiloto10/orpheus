Clap until your hands hurt,  
Standing ovations or boo-boo-boos  
Wa-wa-watch us until we blur,  
Walk off into the sunset  
Tell Rock'n'Roll I'm alone again  
I wanna put the midwest home again  
Your time has passed  
They say never means never  
So the fast dance won't last,  
But never means forever  
Never means forever  
  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
Eh, eh, eh-eh, eh, eh  
ALPHAdog and oh oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo  
Welcome to the new deja vu  
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
  
We must have the best coach  
Tell the best jokes  
We must make it hard to  
Look so easy doing something so hard  
Like you must see my way  
They scream when they look at me  
I'm a, I'm a star  
I'm a, I'm a star  
I'm a star, Ohh, I'm a star  
  
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac  
Eh, eh, eh-eh, eh, eh  
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo  
Welcome to the new deja vu  
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains  
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac  
  
You're not the first  
Or the last but you're possibly the prettiest  
Whoa  
  
He's a fighter past his prime  
He's in the gutter waving his hand  
I'm just fine  
  
You're not the first  
Or the last but you're possibly the prettiest  
Whoa  
  
He's a fighter past his prime  
He's in the gutter waving his hand  
  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
Eh, eh, eh-eh, eh, eh  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo  
Welcome to the new deja vu  
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
  
(whoaa, ohh, whoaa)  
Abracadabra  
(whoaa, ohh, whoaa)
