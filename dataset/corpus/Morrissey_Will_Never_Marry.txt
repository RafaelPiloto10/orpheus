I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you, but no  
I will live my life as I  
Will undoubtedly die alone  
  
I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you  
I will live my life as I, oh  
For whether you stay  
Or stray  
An in-built guilt catches up with you  
  
And as it comes around to your place  
At five a.m., wakes you up  
And it laughs in your face  
  
Don't speak!  
Sing
