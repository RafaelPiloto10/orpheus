Ooh, ooh anytime that you want me  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you need me  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you want me to  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you need me  
  
I'm standing here with my arms a mile wide  
Hoping and praying for you  
Listen to me and enlighten me  
I hope that you need me too, 'cause,  
  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you want me  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you want me  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you want me to  
Ooh, ooh anytime that you need me  
  
Give me all of your sunshine  
A spark is all I need  
To take away, all of the shadows  
Well what more can I say.  
  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all  
Anytime at all
