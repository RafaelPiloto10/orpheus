Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold  
Tom is as bold as the knights of old  
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam  
There's nothing he won't do to get a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And he curses himself for the life he's led  
And rolls himself a Harry rag and puts himself to bed  
  
Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass  
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass  
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag  
But still she's got the strength to have a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And she curses herself for the life she's led  
And rolls herself a Harry rag and puts herself to bed  
  
Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all  
You may take some but you never take it all  
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad  
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a Harry rag and put myself to bed  
  
Ah, the smart young ladies of the land  
Can't relax without a Harry in their hand  
And they light one and they boast and brag  
So content because they got a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag  
So content because they got a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
I'll do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a Harry rag and put myself to bed
