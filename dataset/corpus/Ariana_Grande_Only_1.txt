I want you, I want you  
I want you, I want you  
I want you, I want you  
  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
  
Lookin' in your eyes makes me wonder how  
I got so much time with you and there's more around  
I know all the competition that's after you  
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?  
  
That we're living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
Baby, oh, it's hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
That's how I know  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
As I'm layin' down with you every night  
It still gets to me that you remain by my side  
I ain't saying that I'm not deservin' of you  
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when  
  
I wished for living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
So, baby, oh, it's hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
That's how I know  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
Only 1  
Be your only 1  
Only 1
