I've come a long way  
I was a show on ice  
Dazzling and brittle  
But subject to the sun  
  
And then one day  
I went little by little  
Back to the water  
The place where I'd come from  
  
And I went under  
Like stones tied in a sack  
And I got emptied  
And started my way back  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my schemes drowned at the seams  
Have left me fine in my own skin  
I've come a long way  
Just to begin  
  
I've come a long way  
Under the cover of darkness  
Trusting a stranger  
A boatman at the shore  
  
The scourge of hope  
The ugly face of danger  
The keepers of the keys  
Had me down on my knees  
In front of the gilded doors  
  
And in a world where every ax was poised to grind  
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind  
I've come a long way  
  
I used to be twisted  
When you called it an opiate  
A simple way to cope  
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes  
  
They start out tight  
And then they hurt your tired feet at night  
But then they give a little day by day  
And then before you know it  
You look back and you've come a long way  
  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
You call my name  
My name  
You call my name  
My shame  
You call my name  
My home  
Everything I own  
You call my name  
  
If it's got my name, it's got your name on it  
Everything I own has got your name on it  
When I was trying to cross the river  
You were at the river getting me across and now  
Everything, everything I own  
Has got your name on it  
Oh everything  
I've got your name on it
