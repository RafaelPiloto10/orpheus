If I'm late, darling, don't hesitate  
Just go without me, and I'll see you there anyway  
If I miss you at the station  
I want you on that train  
I don't want a sad sack  
'Cause I'll be there come what may  
  
Leave a message with the porter  
Or leave it at the gate  
Just let me know that you're aboard her  
Just a word to know that you're safe  
  
I walk from Maryland to Silver town  
I hoped to catch you in the street  
I must have missed you by a moment, dear  
I tried the place we always meet  
  
So if I'm late darling, don't hesitate, no, no  
Go on your lonesome, and I'll catch you there anyway  
I might lose sometime, babe  
But if I do, I'll make amends in an hour  
When I'm laying down beside you
