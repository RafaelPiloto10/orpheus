The motherfuckers got in my head  
Trying to make me someone else instead  
  
It's my world now  
It's my world now  
It's my world...  
It's my world...!  
  
Mama, why's it rainin' in my room?  
Cheer up boy! Clouds will move on soon!  
Heavy fog got me lost inside  
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride!  
  
It's my world  
You can't have it  
It's my world, It's my world  
It's my world  
  
Sucka!  
  
I'm out of my head, out of my head  
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head  
Get 'em out!  
  
Who's in charge of my head today?  
Dancin' devils in angels way  
  
It's my time now  
It's my time now  
It's my time...  
Yeah, it's my time...!  
  
Look out motherfuckers here I come!  
I'm gonna make my head my home  
The sons of bitches tried to take my head  
Tried to make me someone else instead  
  
It's my world  
You can't have it  
It's my world, it's my world  
It's my world  
  
Sucka!  
  
I'm out of my head, out of my head  
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head  
Get 'em out!  
  
Not only do I not know the answer...  
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)  
  
God it feels...  
Like it only rains on me (x4)  
  
Not only do I not know the answer...  
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)  
  
Sucka!  
  
I'm out of my head, out of my head  
Out of my head, get 'em out of my head  
Get 'em out!  
  
Enough's enough (x8)
