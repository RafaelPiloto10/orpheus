In the middle of the night I heard her pray  
So bitterly and so softly, yeah  
She prayed for her children  
She prayed for their education  
Then she prayed for the man  
That left her with her children  
We praise heroes everyday  
But there are those that we forget to praise  
The women of this world  
They don't run from anything  
They stand and fight for what's right  
Oh oh oh  
God bless the women  
Even when times are so hard  
They are so cool, calm and collected  
They don't run from anything  
They stand and fight for what is right  
They do not run from responsibilities  
They stand and fight for what Is right  
Oh oh oh  
God bless the women
