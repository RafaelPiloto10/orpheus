When you were lonely, you needed a man  
Someone to lean on, well I understand  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me.
