Straight outta school but still just a fool  
Thought the streets were paved with gold  
He moved off the block and  
Found he was lost  
In a world he'd never known  
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent  
Played all the aces and wound up president  
You see it's okay  
Got to find your own way  
Keep on trying all day  
And you know your time will come  
You'll get your chance to run  
  
You're livin' in America  
You're livin' in the home of the dream  
You're livin' in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
Soap opera child with hope in her eyes  
Lookin' for a starrin' role  
She came into town and acted the clown  
Had a long, long way to go  
Waitin' on tables and pumpin' gasoline  
She served and agent,  
Now she's a movie queen  
You see it's okay  
Got to find your own way  
Keep on tryin' all day  
And you know the time will come  
For each and everyone  
  
You're livin' in America  
You're livin' in the home of the dream  
You're livin' in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
You'll stand alone on a long hard road  
With a crowd that you can't see  
Just start by steppin' out  
Then let your mind run free  
  
You're livin' in America  
You're livin' in the home of the dream  
You're livin' in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
It's okay  
You're livin' in the USA  
Find your dream  
You know that dream can set  
You free  
  
It's okay  
We're part of the United State  
You and me  
Can be just what we want to be  
He's okay  
He left the block and reached  
The top  
She's all right  
The agent put her name in lights  
  
He's okay  
He's paid his rent he's president  
She's all right  
She's on your TV screen tonight
