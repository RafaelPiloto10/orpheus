Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
  
Walk on, talk on,  
Baby tell no lies.  
Don't you be caught  
With a tear in your eye.  
  
Sure enough,  
They'll be sellin' stuff  
When the moon begins to rise.  
Pretty bad when  
You're dealin' with the man,  
And the light shines in your eyes.  
  
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
  
Snake eyes, French fries  
And I got lots of gas.  
Full moon and a jumpin' tune,  
Now you don't have to ask.  
  
Sure enough,  
They'll be sellin' stuff  
When the moon begins to rise.  
Pretty bad when  
You're dealin' with the man,  
And the light shines in your eyes.  
  
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,  
Let's go, let's go,  
Let's go downtown.  
  
Walk on, talk on,  
Baby tell no lies.  
Don't you be caught  
With a tear in your eye.  
  
Sure enough,  
They'll be sellin' stuff  
When the moon begins to rise.  
Pretty bad when  
You're dealin' with the man,  
And the light shines in your eyes.  
  
Pretty bad when  
You're dealin' with the man,  
And the light shines in your eyes.
