When you're out there on your own  
Where your memories can find you  
Like a circle goes around  
You were lost until you found out  
What it all comes down to  
  
One by one  
The lonely feelings come  
Day by day, they slowly fade away  
  
Ooh, the look was in her eyes  
You never know what might be found there  
She was dancing right in time  
And the moves she made so fine  
Like the music that surrounds her  
  
Should I stay or go?  
I really want to know  
Would I loose or win  
If I try and love again?  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh I'm gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love  
  
Right or wrong, what's done is done  
It's only moments that you borrow  
But the thoughts will linger on  
Of the lady and her song  
When the sun comes up tomorrow  
  
Well, it might take years  
To see through all these tears  
Don't let go  
When you find it you will know  
  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Sometimes lose, sometimes win,  
Sometimes you need a friend  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Gonna try,  
Gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try  
Gonna try
