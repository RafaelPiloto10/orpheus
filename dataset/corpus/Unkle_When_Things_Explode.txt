Your skull-fucked little lives  
In shadows where you hide  
A life that was designed  
You've been cheated oh so blind  
You laid it on the line  
These twisted words of time  
And how your spirit shines  
I wish that you were mine  
Yeah lately I know that I've been crawling  
I know that I've been falling  
Into your dream  
Imagine no more tears  
Dissolving all your fears  
With tooth and claw we fight  
Into this endless night  
Yeah lately I know that I've been crawling  
I know that I've been falling  
Into your dream  
I saw my tears in your eyes  
You saw your fears in mine  
We watched it burn together  
Watched it burn together  
Burn yeah, burn watched it burn burn yeah burn  
Watched it burn, burn watched it burn  
Watched it burn, burn watched it burn  
All is forgiven.
