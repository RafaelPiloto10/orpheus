My eyes can see, my hands can feel  
My ears can hear, my eyes can see  
They can see everything, everything  
  
A bird that flies, a bird that dies  
And who knows why? But with my eyes  
I can see everything, everything  
  
And now the dawn is breaking  
I see the dawn is breaking  
And life seems very good to me  
I see your face is smiling  
Your bed looks warm, inviting  
I feel your hand walk over me  
  
I climb in bed beside you  
The past is not behind you  
You feel a little pain inside  
And now our heads are whirring  
It's done, there's no returning  
You feel the little pain - it dies  
  
My eyes can see, my hands can feel  
My ears can hear, my eyes can see  
They can see everything, everything  
  
A bird that flies, a bird that dies  
And who knows why? But with my eyes  
I can see everything, everything  
And who knows what it all means?
