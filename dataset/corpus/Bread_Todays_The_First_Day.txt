Empty nights - endless days  
Sometimes love turns out that way  
Yes I know - it went too fast  
But you can't keep livin' your life in the past  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
It's up to you to make the best of your life  
Open your eyes it's another day  
She was there - she was gone  
You don't know how you'll get along  
I've been there - and I recall  
Better that than never to have loved at all  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
You've got to go and make the best of your life  
For every night there's another day  
Yes you say you've been in love before  
You've been around and you know the score  
But when the tears fill your eyes  
Then sometimes they can blind you  
So my friend - you must know  
Love will come - and love may go  
But when it does don't despair  
Every space has someone just meant to be there  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
I know you're gonna make the best of your life  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
Lift up your eyes, it's the rest of your life
