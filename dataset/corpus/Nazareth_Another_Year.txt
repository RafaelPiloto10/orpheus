So your plane was late  
You missed that date  
And your horse can't win  
So you drink another bottle of gin  
  
And your shares went down  
They touched the ground  
And your best laid plans  
Have slipped right out of your hands  
  
So you think you're fat  
Well that's a fact  
But your well ran dry  
So you had to walk another mile  
  
Think about them, think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those who never saw  
  
So your car won't start  
Needs a special part  
But you made your choice  
Now you're stuck with all your big boys toys  
  
Now the word's around  
You've gone aground  
And you've lost your wind  
You'll never see your ship come in  
  
Think about them, think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
  
Mother's, father's  
Sister's, brother's  
Old man, young man  
Whale song, all gone  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Think about those who'll never see another  
Those who'll never see another  
Those who'll never see  
Think about them, think about them.
