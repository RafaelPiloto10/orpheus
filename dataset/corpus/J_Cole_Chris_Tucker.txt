[Hook:]  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Aye, all you broke niggas be quiet  
  
[Verse 1: J Cole]  
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge  
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds  
My main chick she got real hair, ain't never got to go shop for hers  
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs  
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna find me, now the ho wanna climb me  
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me  
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching oops nigga  
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: J Cole]  
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded  
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you  
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage  
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no bucket  
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ay  
She think I'm in the nba, why a nigga can't have his mba?  
Next time I'mma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her  
"You so tall what team do u play for?" No bitch I'm a doctor  
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah  
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit  
Not stick like a bowlegged chick  
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar  
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber  
Nigga say they pop cause they don't fill they collars up  
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up  
Bitch nigga...  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]  
I'mma start off with these four bars  
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar  
I'm rockin' gold balls, whip your ass with this crowbar  
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"  
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do  
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe  
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date  
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste  
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage  
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service  
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit  
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense  
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it  
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Outro: J Cole]  
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models  
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow  
Please don't tell my mom I spent tuition on these bottles  
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'
