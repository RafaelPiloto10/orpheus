Red Neck Hoe  
"Rapping to this bitch with a red neck  
A red neck, that fucking red neck  
Rapping to this bitch with a red neck  
A down south bitch with a red-ass neck"  
[Violent J]  
Bitch, you gotta red neck  
But you look kinda straight so I'm bout to step  
Heard you like fucking in pig pens  
You never seen boys, so you fuck your girlfriends  
Bitch, I know you's a ho  
So let me fuck you with my big toe  
'cause I don't care what them hicks can do  
Shit, I can fuck like a chicken hawk too  
Bitch, we can take a walk  
But I hate the way you fuckin' hillbillies talk  
So keep your filthy ass mouth shut  
And don't say shit, nasty slut  
Bitch, I want to hit it  
So I can drop your ass in a New York minute  
But you quick to act like you didn't know  
Like you didn't know, that I'm a jigglo, you didn't know  
Bitch, we can sit on the porch  
Swing in a chair, I don't fucking care  
But then it's to the sac, to the sac we go  
I'm finna fuck this red neck ho  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Bitch, you's a ho  
And ho you's a bitch  
Everybody knows that you's a...  
Funky funky bitch  
"Rapping to this bitch with a red neck  
A fucking red neck, a red-ass neck  
Rapping to this bitch with a red neck  
Said a mop-top corn stalk red-ass neck"  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Bitch, it's 2 Dope  
Before I threw you this dick, I throw you some soap  
'cause you been in the barn all day  
Milking cows and fucking with hay  
Bitch, if you let me hit  
I don't care, you can play your Wayne Newton shit  
I can take a little Conway Twitty  
While I'm sucking on red neck tittie  
Bitch, I go down south  
With a piece of wheat hanging out my mouth  
And sport a funky-ass straw hat  
But after I hit it...MOTHERFUCK THAT!  
Bitch, I from the big city  
And I'm finna fall asleep on your big tittie  
Yeah, it's the farmer's daughter  
But I ain't gonna fuck in no swamp water  
Bitch, drop your overalls  
And we fuck in the back of a horse stall  
You're the ugly bitch I know  
But I still fuck ya, red neck ho  
[Chorus (2x)]  
[Esham]  
My ratsaw can't even hang  
With the wicked shit you've done  
You go lynching with your gang  
On a brother or a Mexican  
Fuck, this shit may never quite  
Bigots may never learn  
I'll cut your motherfucking throat out, bigot  
Now it's your turn  
Bigots in the north seem to get respect  
You know I'd choke that greasy neck  
Step to the left, step to the right  
In my piece, and I'll fuck your face up  
Bitch, 'cause I don't sleep  
I said "Fuck you, bitch, I don't sleep"  
In the south there's a lot of good faces  
But shit, I'm gat on a fucking racists  
[Violent J]  
Bitch, I can't tell from where I'm at  
But it looks like your neck is red, fuck that  
I'm about to step  
So I can say I fucked a ho with a red neck  
[Chorus (9x)]
