I think this time you've said enough  
To make me want to leave this place  
Still I keep coming back for more of  
The same to fan the dying flame  
Here inside these walls that seem  
To move a little closer every day  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then  
  
I think this time that was the best time  
That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Take away the in-between  
Think about the good things now and then  
We will see the day when you  
Or I will stay or face up to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
And think about the good things now and then
