Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
  
Heat grows in his mind,  
Hits the steering wheel to tryin'  
Tune the radio out loud  
  
He heard Jobim say,  
And his heart began to sway  
He didn't think of anything  
But his baby  
  
He was drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
He kept drivin' down Brazil  
  
He feels batucada  
He dances the samba  
If only in his head  
  
[Chorus]  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
And he gave the girls a thrill  
In his low ride bonneville  
He's the king king of the hill  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
Shhh shut up and get your baby  
Please comma comma get your baby  
Please comma comma get your baby,  
She's waiting  
  
He cruised up to the light,  
She jumps in by his side  
They kiss and wave goodbye oh  
  
They had so much to say,  
But the groove began to play  
He couldn't think of anything but his baby  
  
He was drivin'  
He kept on on drivin'  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
He dreams of Amanda  
While he sips guarana,  
In his mind she's dressed in red  
If anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
And he gave the girls a thrill  
In his low ride bonneville  
He's the king king of the hill  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
Comma comma comma get your baby  
  
She's waiting  
  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
Tudo bem... Tudo bem... Tudo bom bom...  
  
He feels batucada he dances the samba  
If only in his head  
Makes me crazy  
  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin' down Brazil  
  
Just have to comma get your baby  
Just have to comma get your baby  
Just have to coma get your baby  
She's waiting
