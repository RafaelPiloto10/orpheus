Goodbye, it's time for me to go  
So, baby, don't cry  
I want you to know that, baby  
I'll be back someday  
  
Cheer up,  
The skies above are bound to clear up  
I like to stick around, but baby,  
I'll be back someday.  
  
Don't be blue, I'll return with love untold  
When I do, I want you to have and hold  
  
I know that you'll be close to me  
Wherever I go,  
So, when I say goodbye, remember  
I'll be back someday.
