Take me when I'm young and true  
Was it me or was it you ?  
Take me when I'm not so strong  
Why has it taken you so long ?  
Take me when you feel I've gone  
I always knew I could be someone  
Take me if you think you're right  
Do it now before it's light  
  
Take me if you think I'm sweet  
Though my life feels incomplete  
Take me when I wish to live  
For I still have this to give  
  
Take me when I'm young and true  
Was it me or was it you ?  
Take me when I start to cry  
Take me take me don't ask why
