she sits by the window, stares into the night  
just waiting for a foreign sound from outside  
far beyond the atmospheres, she is listening for a call to take her homewards  
to herself  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you in the morning  
she knows that the pavement's hard, there between the stars  
to travel on to martian homesick city  
she is weeping silently but there's not a tear  
just raindrops falling from the painted ceiling  
the dance of the foraging bee will number all the things  
she has been longing for all of her life  
i will not pass this night in vain, she says  
i'll stand this kind of rain  
i know the way, i'll find the path  
yes, carol wants to go to mars, back where the red-cold sun is sinking  
to the channels of a'daar  
day breaks through the grating  
someone moves a chair  
and sunlight blisters dazzling on a glass  
take a pill and greet the day for sedative holidays  
why aren't you sleeping in the night  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you till the evening  
we shall meet tomorrow night  
and i'll kiss you just as tenderly as cygnus kissed the deserts
