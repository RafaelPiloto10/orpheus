Could have come through anytime,  
Cold lonely, puritan  
What are you fighting for?  
It's not my security.  
  
It's just an old war,  
Not even a cold war,  
Don't say it in Russian,  
Don't say it in German.  
Say it in broken English,  
Say it in broken English.  
  
Lose your father, your husband,  
Your mother, your children.  
What are you dying for?  
It's not my reality.  
  
It's just an old war,  
Not even a cold war,  
Don't say it in Russian,  
Don't say it in German.  
Say it in broken English,  
Say it in broken English.
