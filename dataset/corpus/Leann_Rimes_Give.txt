Everybody's reachin' for something  
Every day pullin' and tugging  
And always wantin' a little more  
Holdin' on to her like an anchor  
Treatin' those we love like strangers  
Takin' names and keeping score  
We all know, what we're really after  
Somewhere along the road, we got it backwards  
  
If you want to get love then give it  
If you want to feel some forgiveness  
Then you've gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness, show some  
You'll be surprised at how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.  
  
I been down right stubborn,  
At one time or another,  
And found it easier to bend.  
I've had a shoulder to lean on  
Been the one who got to be strong  
And peace was waiting at both ends  
I've felt the power, I've seen what it can do  
It's seemed so simple, so simple that it's true  
  
If you want to get love then give it  
If you want to feel some forgiveness  
Then you've gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness, show some  
You'll be surprised at how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.  
  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness show some  
You'll be surprised of how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.
