All my friends packing up,  
Loading up their Volvo's  
And their pick up trucks  
Going down the road,  
To try their luck  
So spin that dream,  
Go heading for the city  
Roll that dice,  
Say a prayer,  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there,  
Win or lose,  
We're heading for the city  
  
Well I got a problem hear what I say  
They're telling me I got to move away  
I was happy here,  
They tell me I can't stay  
Now what's screaming rain is heading this way  
For those who sleep and choose to stay  
The game they didn't know  
They had to play  
So win or lose  
We're heading for the city  
So roll that dice  
Say a prayer  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there,  
Win or lose,  
We're heading for the city
