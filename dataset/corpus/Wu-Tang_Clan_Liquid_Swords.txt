[RZA]  
See, sometimes...  
You gotta flash em back  
See niggaz don't know where this shit started  
Why'all know where it came from  
I'm sayin we gonna take why'all back to the swords  
We bounce, yo  
  
[Chorus: GZA, (RZA)]  
When the MC's came, to live our their name  
And to perform (forrrrm)  
Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)  
With before Pete Rock-ed it on, now gone  
That the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)  
With the building to be born  
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to guy  
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH  
  
[GZA]  
Fake niggas get flipped  
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns  
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down  
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe  
  
On some loud howl shit, to insert a fiend  
But it was yo ock, the shop stolen art  
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart  
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes they get hurt  
  
Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt  
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals  
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble  
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt  
  
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts  
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon  
I represent from midnight to high noon  
I don't waste ink, nigga I think  
  
I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink  
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed  
Through clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed  
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted  
Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[GZA]  
I'm on a Mission, that niggaz say is Impossible  
But when I swing my swords they all choppab
