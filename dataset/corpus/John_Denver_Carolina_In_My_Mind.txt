In my mind I'm gone to Carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine?  
Can't you just feel the moonshine?  
Ain't it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind?  
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
Karin, she's a silver sun  
You best walk her way and watch it shine  
And watch her watch the morning come  
A silver tear appearing now  
I'm cryin', ain't I?  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
There ain't no doubt in no ones mind  
That love's the finest thing around  
Whisper something soft and kind  
And hey babe, the sky's on fire  
I'm dying, ain't I?  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind I'm gone to Carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine?  
Can't you just feel the moonshine?  
And, ain't it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind?  
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
Dark and silent, late last night,  
I think I might have heard the highway call  
And geese in flight and dogs that bite  
The signs that might be omens say  
I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind  
  
With a holy host of others standin' around me  
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon  
And it seems like it goes on like this forever  
You must forgive me, if I'm up and gone to  
Carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind I'm goin' to Carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine?  
Can't you just feel the moonshine?  
Ain't is just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind  
Gone to Carolina in my mind  
And I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind  
Goin' to Carolina in my mind  
Gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
Say nice things about me 'cause I'm gone south now  
Got to carry on without me, I'm gone
