Hey little girl is your daddy home  
Did he go away and leave you all alone  
I got a bad desire  
I'm on fire  
  
Tell me now baby is he good to you  
Can he do to you the things that I do  
I can take you higher  
I'm on fire  
  
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby  
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley  
through the middle of my soul  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
and a freight train running through the  
middle of my head  
Only you can cool my desire  
I'm on fire
