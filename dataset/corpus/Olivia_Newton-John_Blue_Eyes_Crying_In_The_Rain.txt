In the twilight glow I see you  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
  
Someday, when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
