Five to one baby one in five  
No one here gets out alive now  
You get yours baby I'll get mine  
Gonna make it baby if we try  
Come on, yeah!  
The old get older and the young get stronger  
May take a week and it may take longer  
They got the guns but we got the numbers  
Gonna win yeah we're taking over  
Come on, yeah  
Your ballroom days are over, baby  
Night is drawing near  
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years  
You walk across the floor with flowers in your hands  
Trying to tell me no one fucking understands  
Trading your hours for a handful of dimes  
Gonna make it baby in our prime  
Get together one more time  
I wanna fuck you, mother  
I wanna fuck you, mother  
I wanna fuck you, mother  
Fuck you!  
Get together one more time  
Fuck you, mother
