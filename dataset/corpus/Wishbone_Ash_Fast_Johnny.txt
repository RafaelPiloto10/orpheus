I fell in love with a dark-eyed lady,  
She seemed to be on her own,  
And from nowhere when I came over -  
A princess without a throne.  
That night as I was takin' her home,  
I got a feelin' that we weren't alone.  
Keep your hands on the wheel, we got a tail there,  
Tryin' to put us off the road.  
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you?  
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you?  
Fast johnny, I'm flat on the boards -  
Fast johnny, I'm cutting the corners -  
Fast johnny, I'm closin' the door -  
Fast johnny, don't chase me in your car no more!  
You know nobody can drive quite like I can,  
Runnin' every red light in town,  
We danced on the floor, danced on the street,  
Danced as the wheels turned around.  
Maybe johnny, you'll meet your match  
When you look into my chevy's eyes,  
Keep your engine hot and running,  
'cause this sweet little honey's gonna take you by surprise.  
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you?  
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you?  
Fast johnny, I'm flat on the boards -  
Fast johnny, I'm cuttin' the corners -  
Fast johnny, I'm closin' the door -  
Fast johnny, don't chase me in your car no more!  
Repeat and close
