Well, I love the way you walk  
With your skin tight stride,  
You got my eyes wide open  
An' my loose tongue tied  
A French kiss mouth  
An' a smile so bad,  
You're the finest woman  
That I ever had  
So it's alright,  
Do anything you want to do  
  
Nobody had to tell you  
How to make a man's heart bleed,  
Your mama always knew  
You was born to succeed  
I can see the honey juice  
Dripping off your lips,  
Girl, you got the Midas Touch  
It's in your fingertips  
But it's alright,  
Do anything you want to do  
  
'Cause after midnight, I'll be alright  
Riding on Cupid's train,  
You give me loving, like I've never had before,  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an' affection,  
Love an' affection  
A little love an' affection  
Sure 'nuff goes a long, long way  
  
You put your arms around me  
Like a circle 'round the sun,  
Your eyes turn on the hypnotizing game  
You play for fun  
I'm caught in your spell  
Just like the spider an' the fly,  
An' I can't break away from you  
No matter how I try  
But, it's alright,  
Do anything you want to do  
  
'cause after midnight, I'll be alright  
Riding on Cupid's train,  
You give me loving, like I've never had before,  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an' affection,  
Love an' affection  
A little love an' affection  
Sure 'nuff goes a long, long way  
  
'cause after midnight, I'll be alright  
Riding on Cupid's train,  
You give me loving, like I've never had before,  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
So give me love an' affection,  
Love an' affection  
A little love an' affection  
Sure 'nuff goes a long, long way  
  
Love an' affection  
A little love an' affection  
Baby, baby, love an' affection  
Sure 'nuff goes a long, long way  
  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
I need love an' affection,  
Sure 'nuff goes a long, long way...
