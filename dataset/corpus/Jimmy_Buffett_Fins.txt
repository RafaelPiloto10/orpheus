She came down from Cincinnati,  
It took her three days on the train.  
Lookin' for some peace and quiet,  
Hoped to see the sun again.  
  
But now she lives down by the ocean  
She's takin' care to look for sharks.  
They hang out in the local bars,  
And they feed right after dark.  
  
Can't you feel 'em circlin', honey?  
Can't you feel 'em swimmin' around?  
You got fins to the left, fins to the right,  
And you're the only bait in town.  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
You got fins to the left, fins to the right,  
And you're the only girl in town.  
  
She's saving up all of her money,  
Wants to head it south in May,  
Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n' roll man,  
Somewhere down Montserrat way.  
  
But the money's good in the season,  
Helps to lighten up her load.  
Boys keep her high as the months go by,  
She's getting postcards from the road.  
  
Can't you feel 'em closin' in, honey?  
Can't you feel 'em schoolin' around  
You got fins to the left, fins to the right,  
And you're the only girl in town.  
  
Sailed off to Antigua,  
It took her three days on a boat  
Lookin' for some peace and quiet,  
Maybe keep her dreams afloat.  
  
But now she feels like a remora  
'Cause the school's still close at hand  
Just behind the reef are the big white teeth,  
Of the sharks that can swim on the land.  
  
Can't you feel 'em circlin', honey?  
Can't you feel 'em schoolin' around?  
You got fins to the left, fins to the right,  
And you're the only bait in town.  
You got fins to the left, fins to the right,  
And you're the only girl in town.
