All you brothers and sisters  
Lookin' for a better way  
Why don't you all go to the country  
Hitch a ride from the city  
Get away for the day  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
All you dancers and twisters  
Lookin' for a place to play  
Why don't you all go to the country  
People in the city  
Get away for the day  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it
