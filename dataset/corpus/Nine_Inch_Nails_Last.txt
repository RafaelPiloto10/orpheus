Gave up trying to figure out my head got lost along the way  
Worn out from giving it up my soul I pissed it all away  
Still stings these shattered nerves  
Pigs we get what pigs deserve  
I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today  
Come come come on you've gotta fill me up  
Come come gotta let me inside of you  
Come come come on you're gotta fix me up  
Come come gotta let me inside of you  
Still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore  
Everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore  
Look through these blackened eyes  
You'll see ten thousand lies  
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore  
Come come come on you've gotta fill me up  
Come come gotta let me inside of you  
Come come come on you're gotta fix me up  
Come come gotta let me get through to you  
This isn't meant to last  
This is for right now  
I know it's all getting away it comes to me as no surprise  
I know what's coming to me is never going to arrive  
Fresh blood through tired skin  
New sweat to drown me in  
Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive  
Come come come on you've gotta fill me up  
Come come gotta let me inside of you  
Come come come on you're gotta fix me up  
Come come gotta let me get through to you  
This isn't meant to last  
This is for right now  
I wish I could put the blame on you  
I want you to make me  
I want you to take me  
I want you to break me  
Then I want you to throw me away
