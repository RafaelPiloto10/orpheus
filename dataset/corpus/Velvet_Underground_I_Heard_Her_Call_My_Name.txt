Ever since I was on cripples Monday,  
I've got my eyeballs on my knees.  
I rapped for hours with mad Mary Williams,  
She said she never understood a word from me  
Because, I know that she cares about me,  
I heard her call my name.  
  
And I know that she's long, dead and gone,  
Still it ain't the same.  
When I wake up in the morning, mama,  
I heard her call my name.  
I know she's dead and long, gone.  
I heard her call my name.  
And then I felt my mind split open.  
  
I know that she's long, dead and gone,  
Still it ain't the same.  
When I wake up in the morning, mama,  
I heard her call my name.  
I know she's dead and long, gone.  
Still, I heard her call my name.  
And then my mind split open.
