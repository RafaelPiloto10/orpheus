'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ  
  
You bought my life with the  
Blood that You shed on the cross  
When You died for the sins of men  
And You let out a cry, crucified, now alive in me  
  
These hands are Yours  
Teach them to serve as You please  
And I'll reach out desperate to see  
All the greatness of God  
May my soul rest assured in You  
  
I'll never be the same  
No, I'll never be the same  
  
'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ  
  
You changed it all, You broke down the wall  
When I spoke and confessed  
In You I'm blessed, now, I walk in the light  
In victorious sight of You  
  
I'll never be the same  
No, I'll never be the same  
  
'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ  
  
'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ
