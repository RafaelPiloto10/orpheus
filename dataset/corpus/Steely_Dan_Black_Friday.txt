When Black Friday comes  
I'll stand down by the door  
And catch the grey men when they  
Dive from the fourteenth floor  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'll collect everything I'm owed  
And before my friends find out  
I'll be on the road  
  
When Black Friday falls you know it's got to be  
Don't let it fall on me  
When Black Friday comes  
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook  
  
Gonna strike all the big red words  
From my little black book  
Gonna do just what I please  
Gonna wear no socks and shoes  
  
With nothing to do but feed  
All the kangaroos  
When Black Friday comes I'll be on that hill  
You know I will  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'm gonna dig myself a hole  
Gonna lay down in it 'til  
I satisfy my soul  
  
Gonna let the world pass by me  
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me  
And if he don't come across  
I'm gonna let it roll  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'm gonna stake my claim  
I'll guess I'll change my name
