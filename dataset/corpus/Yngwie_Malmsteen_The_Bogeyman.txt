Late at night I like to hide.  
I dwell inside the shadows.  
But I wasn't always this alive.  
Since you hung me from the gallows.  
You know I love the night.  
And I love the darkness.  
As I cruise along the highway.  
Now there is no more light.  
And there is no more sweetness.  
I will always have it my way.  
Well, I am the ghost inside your head.  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
Don't you cry for those who bled.  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
I am the bogeyman.  
Well don't believe in what you see.  
And don't believe in what you hear.  
Don't you worry, it's only me.  
And I am the sum of all your fears.  
Well, I am the ghost inside your head.  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
Don't you cry for those who bled.  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
I am the bogeyman, And I'm no holyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
[guitar solo]  
I am the bogeyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
And I'm no holyman.  
I am the bogeyman
