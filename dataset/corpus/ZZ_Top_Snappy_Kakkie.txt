I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
Do you want to play?  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
I said whatcha' say!  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
They'll never know we're gone 'til the break 'o day  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did they talk to you today?  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did you see it their way?  
The moon she is high, we must leave tonite  
We must get away, we will join the fight  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie!  
Did our brothers stay  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Will our sisters pay  
Does it really matter of the friends we lost  
It doesn't really matter cause their souls were lost  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
Do you want to play?  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
I say Hey! watcha' say!  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
They'll never know we're gone til the break 'o day  
So come on!
