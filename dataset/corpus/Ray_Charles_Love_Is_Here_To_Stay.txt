It's very clear, our love is here to stay.  
Ah, not for a year. But, ever and a day.  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know,  
May just be passin' fancy's anytime they go  
  
Uh, but uh, wait a minute darlin'  
Our love is here to stay.  
Ah, together we're, mm hm  
We're goin' a long, long way  
  
In time The Rockies may crumble  
Gibralter may tumble.  
They're only made of clay.  
But, our love is here to stay  
  
But, ooh my dear, our love is here to stay.  
Ah, together we're goin' a long, long way.  
In time The Rockies may crumble and that Gibralter may tumble.  
They'e only made of clay.  
But, our love is here to stay.  
(You better believe it darlin'.  
I'm tellin' you like it 'eye ess.' Oh!)  
Our love is here to stay
