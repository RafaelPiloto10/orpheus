I remember when you were only seventeen  
You were the finest girl that my eyes had ever seen  
I guess you found it hard to simply just ignore  
This scruffy beat up working class teenage troubadour  
  
So we fell in love and I tuned your heart  
With my out of tune guitar  
You were wonderful, you were mystical  
And the envy of all of my friends  
Seems like only yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach  
  
Oh what a time it was  
What a time to be alive  
Remember Janice and Jimmy  
Kennedy and King  
How they cried  
  
I sang to you the songs of Lamb and Jack  
You were Greta Garbo and I was Cadillac  
And we played so hard and we loved so hard  
Seemed we never ever slept  
There were crazy days, there were wonderful days  
And I loved you with all of my heart  
Seems like only yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach  
  
Your daddy had plans that did not include me  
And he won't stay away from your door  
And I dreamed how I dreamed I could steal you away  
To some far distant shore  
  
Then early one morning  
I awoke to find you gone  
You wrote 'I love you baby  
But it's time for me to move on'  
And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor  
I swear to God I could not have loved you anymore  
  
And as I sit here the night ,playing with my kids  
Wondering where you are in this world  
Did you find your man, are you happy now?  
Do you ever stop and think about me  
  
How I long for yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach
