I found a path to follow  
I knew it straight away  
Now that I found it I won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
I walk through the woods and holler  
The songbirds will laugh and play  
They know I' ve found it and won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
The woods are alive with laughter  
The rivers are drunk with mirth  
They all know what I' ve been after  
They' re rejoicing for my rebirth,  
For my rebirth.  
  
I found a path to follow  
But it' s a path for two  
Why don' t you come here beside me  
I won' t stray, no, I will not stray  
From you.
