I saw him turn on  
Like a machine in the park  
Saying 'please come with me'  
But you've been there before  
  
I saw him whirr away  
Into the night  
Like a nightmare on wheels  
Saying 'never again'  
  
I'd give it all up for you  
I'd even be a number just for you  
The strangest living boy  
You could ever wish to see  
  
'that's me'  
Yellowed newspapers  
Tell the story of someone  
'do you know this man? '  
  
Tomorrow the cure  
Only police ever  
See night time for real  
Turn on the light  
And cry 'no more, no more'  
  
I was standing outside your door  
Waiting for the grey men to go  
When my mind turned on me  
With a vengeance I had never known  
  
My own  
Everyone heard  
The voice on the radio  
Saying 'why move around  
  
And waste my time'  
There are no  
Independents anymore  
The tape is a circle  
But who really cares  
  
I saw you behind the wall  
I even heard you laugh at me  
You disgust me tonight  
With your answer to something new  
That's you
