As years are passing by  
Silence becomes your friend  
You see the world in a different way  
Don't be afraid of getting old  
Life's still full of joy  
And the beauty of the past is rejoicing your mind  
  
When days are getting short  
And winter comes along  
Your life slows down and down  
Like a river is getting wide  
The worlds have lost their voice  
You remember your morning flowing to the endless sea  
  
When days are getting short  
And winter comes along  
Your life slows down and down  
Like a river is getting wide  
The worlds have lost their voice  
You remember your morning flowing to the endless sea  
  
Life's like a river in the mountain  
Life's like a sea without end  
Life's like a river in the mountain  
Life's like a sea without end  
  
Life's like a river in the mountain  
Life's like a sea without end  
Life's like a river in the mountain  
Life's like a sea without end
