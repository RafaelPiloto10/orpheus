I work all day to make a livin'  
No one needs  
Your kind of attitude  
Your sharp tongue  
It cuts me like a razor  
Lip service gets you nowhere  
No, no, no  
Back talk I don't need it  
Be -be -be -back talk I don't need it  
No, no, no back talk  
Don't want to hear it  
Don't give me no back talk  
Watch that temper  
You watch what you're sayin'  
  
Don't talk to me  
With that tone of voice  
Your act is pushin' me  
To the limit  
Can't stand it, can't stand it  
Can't take it any more  
Don't wan't back talk  
I don't need it  
Don't give me back talk  
I don't want to hear it  
Don't give me back talk  
Don't need it, no  
I believe you enjoy  
This aggravation  
Lately that's all I get from you  
You were born to drive me crazy  
Can't take it, can't take it any more from you  
No, no more  
Back talk, I don't need it  
Back talk, I don't need it  
Back talk, Don't want to hear it  
Don't give me no back talk  
Sassy back talk  
Don't give me no sassy back talk  
No I don't want to hear it  
No don't really need it  
No don't give me no  
Give me no don't you give me no
