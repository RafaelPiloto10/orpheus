The creek goes ripplin' by  
I been barefootin' all day with my baby  
Brown leaves have started fallin'  
Leadin' the way  
I like it best just like this  
Doin' nothin' all the way  
So let's lay down in the tall grass  
Dreamin' away  
  
[Chorus]  
And all I want to do is let it be  
And be with you and watch the wind blow by  
And all I want to see is you and me  
Go on forever like the clear blue sky  
Slowly, there's only you and I  
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by  
  
Girl, you know you told me not so long ago  
To let it come, then let it pass  
And all your troubles and your sorrows  
They won't last  
So let me kiss you now little darlin'  
Beneath this autumn moon  
Cold winds, another season  
Will be here soon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I want to do is watch the wind blow by  
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
