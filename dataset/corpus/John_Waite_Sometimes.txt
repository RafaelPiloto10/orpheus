I remember when you whispered low  
I will go with you wherever you go  
Then I went and found someone new  
No one ever made me feel the way that you do  
  
Sometimes you don't know  
When to hold on or when to let go  
Sometimes you don't know  
Sometimes  
  
Then I came home one day  
Your best friend told me you'd gone away  
Had enough of my wild mispent youth  
Now the tears in my eyes are the only truth  
  
Sometimes you don't know  
When to hold on or when to let go  
Sometimes you don't know  
Sometimes you don't know  
  
When to hold on or when to let go  
Sometimes you don't know  
Hey  
Hey Mister D.J.  
  
I don't need no sympathy  
I made my choice  
And when it all comes down  
It all comes down on me  
  
Now if I gotta take this thing  
With my back against the wall  
Won't you play me some Chuck Jackson  
And watch those blue shadows fall  
  
I'm free but I am alone  
Sometimes you don't know  
When to hold on or when to let go  
Sometimes you don't know  
  
Sometimes you don't know  
When to hold on or when to let go  
Sometimes  
Sometimes  
  
You better let go  
Oh whoa oh  
Yeah  
Oh whoa oh  
  
Yeah  
  
Oh whoa oh  
Oh whoa oh  
Oh whoa oh  
Oh whoa oh  
Oh whoa oh
