People talkin' but they just don't know,  
What's in my heart, and why I love you so.  
I love you baby like a miner loves gold.  
Come on sugar, let the good times roll.  
(Let the good times roll).  
  
So many people live in make believe,  
They keep a lot a going up their sleeves.  
But my love baby is no kind that folds.  
Come On Baby, let the good times roll.  
(Let the good times roll).  
  
Let the good times roll  
Oh come on baby  
Come on baby andlet daddy do you so  
Hey yeah, baby let the good times roll  
  
A love is nice if it's understood  
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good  
You got me flippin' like flag on a pole  
Come on sugar, let the good times roll  
  
Let the good times roll  
Hey!  
Let the good times roll  
Let me show a baby  
Let the good times roll
