If you wonder why I'm near you  
Even though I've been denied  
I'm inclined to be a little  
On the sentimental side  
I suppose I should forget you  
If I had an ounce of pride  
But I guess I can't help being  
On the sentimental side  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say, farewell  
Say it just didn't wear well  
But I'm not that way  
I'm in hopes you'll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side  
  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say, farewell  
Say it just didn't wear well  
But I'm not that way  
I'm in hopes you'll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side
