A fire burns for freedom  
A fire burns for freedom  
The smell of decent is I  
I am standing for the truth  
Too long has been denied  
The data of changing is rising  
I hope we realize  
Unchained wings let angels fly  
  
[Chorus]  
I see fields forever  
Growing wild and free  
I see marijuana trees blowing in our breeze  
I see fields forever growing wild and free  
Wild and free  
  
A crime against nations  
A war is there is a message  
In the wind for every race  
Peace and love we saw  
So let us grow is good for the  
Is good for the soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So lost the kiss of death  
Deny the tree of life  
Stand hypocrisy for so many lies  
Corporation greed can only see  
Survive by planting weed  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Crucified savior to save your face  
Demonized nature our saving grace  
We got to put to good use  
What the lord has gave  
Fruits of the tree herbs of the  
  
[Chorus]
