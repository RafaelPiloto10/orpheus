Dressed in dreams for me  
You were what I wished to see  
Elizabeth, Elizabeth  
Love was very new  
Make believe was coming true  
Elizabeth, Elizabeth  
You were all much too much  
Out of reach and out of touch  
When you came to me  
I found it could never be  
Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth  
So a dream has to end  
When it's real  
Not pretend  
Dressed in memories  
You are what you used to be  
Elizabeth, Elizabeth  
Elizabeth
