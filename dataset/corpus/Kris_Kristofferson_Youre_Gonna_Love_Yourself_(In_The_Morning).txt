Heaven knows some man has abused you that's why you think I'm gonna use you  
You say you'd hate yourself in the morning cause you wake up and I'd be gone  
But if you give me just one more chance I can prove you're wrong  
You're gonna love yourself in the morning I'm gonna love you all night long  
You're gonna love yourself in the morning and every morning from now on  
I know what you're thinking and I don't blame you  
It's gonna take a whole lotta love to change you  
When you wake up in the morning you're gonna feel like a brand new girl  
You're gonna see that it can be such a beautiful world  
You're gonna love yourself in the morning...  
You're gonna love yourself in the morning and every morning from now on
