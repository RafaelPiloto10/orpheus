Verse 1:  
Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, bet-ter hur-ry and let's me-an-der  
Ain't you go-in'? Ain't you go-in'? To the lea-der-man, rag-ged me-ter man?  
Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, Let me take you to Al-ex-an-der's  
Grand stand brass band, ain't you com-in' a-long?  
  
Chorus:  
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! Al-ex-an-der's rag-time band!  
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! It's the best band in the land!  
They can play a bu-gle call like you nev-er heard be-fore  
So nat-you-ral that you want to go to war  
That's just the best-est band what am, oh, ma hon-ey lamb  
Come on a-long, come on a-long, let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, the funny man, who's the lead-er of the band  
And if you care to hear the Swa-nee Riv-er played in rag-time  
Come on and hear, come on and hear,  
Al-ex-an-der's Rag-Time Band.  
  
Verse 2:  
Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, there's a fid-dle with notes that scree-ches,  
Like a chick-en, like a chick-en, and the clar-i-net is a col-ored pet  
Come and list-en, come and list-en, to a class-i-cal band what's pea-ches  
Come now, some-how, bet-ter hur-ry a-long!  
  
Chorus:  
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! Al-ex-an-der's rag-time band!  
Come on and hear! Come on and hear! It's the best band in the land!  
They can play a bu-gle call like you nev-er heard be-fore  
So nat-you-ral that you want to go to war  
That's just the best-est band what am, oh, ma hon-ey lamb  
Come on a-long, come on a-long, let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, up to the man, who's the lead-er of the band  
And if you care to hear the Swa-nee Riv-er played in rag-time  
Come on and hear, come on and hear,  
Al-ex-an-der's Rag-Time Band
