Ah ah  
Here's a song  
About living in the past  
If it was so good then  
How come it didn't last?  
If it helps you  
I'll put it in a phrase  
Those were the times  
But these are the days  
  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
  
The times you're smiling back on  
Had that great sitcom  
It hardly compensated  
For the terror of the bomb  
Let me help  
'cause you're looking through a haze  
Those were the times  
These are the days  
  
These are the days  
Hey hey hey  
These are the days  
Can you hear me now?  
These are the days  
Look around look around look around  
These are the days  
  
These are the days  
Hey hey live today  
These are the days  
It's time to put the past away  
These are the days  
The more you do the more you say  
These are the days  
The more I need to get away  
  
You're longing for a time  
There never was  
Now tell me the truth  
You're looking for the reason  
It's because  
You're fighting for youth  
But if I have to listen any more  
To fantasy talk  
Or any other bug you have  
I'm leaving  
  
Now I'm not saying  
Everything is really great  
Hey hey hey  
After sixteen years  
Of legalized class hate  
Why waste time  
Looking back for things to praise?  
Those were the times huh  
But these are the days  
  
These are the days  
Looking back in history  
These are the days  
Time to get contemporary  
These are the days  
The past is not the place to be
