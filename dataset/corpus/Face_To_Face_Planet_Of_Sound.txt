One fine day in my odd past  
I picked me up a transmission  
I turned the fission ignition  
Went looking for the broadcaster  
And when I first touched some ground  
They simply told me to leave  
Was kind of hard to believe  
'Cause there was not one around  
This ain't the planet sound  
This ain't the planet sound  
This ain't the planet sound  
This ain't the planet sound  
I had a talented wine  
That land of classical gas  
And on the planet of glass  
They sent me skipping through time  
I got to somewhere renowned  
For it's canals and color of red  
And lots of guys who shook their heads  
Rhythmically to resound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't no rock and roll town  
This ain't no fuckin' around  
This ain't no planet of sound  
I met a guy in a rover  
He said its one more over  
It's just there where your bound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound  
This ain't the planet of sound
