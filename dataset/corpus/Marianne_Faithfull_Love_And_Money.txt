Is it a crisis ?  
Is it a crime ?  
Or is it a fantasy ?  
Does it take time ?  
Will it cost money ?  
Will it mean love ?  
Sure isn't easy  
To get in the mood  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
See you at the parties  
You're never the same  
Do you make money ?  
What is your name ?  
Where can I find you ?  
Out in the night  
Who are your friends ?  
Are they dark or light ?  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
Tell me the dreams you never told anyone  
Gimme a break.  
Are you really a virgin who's never loved anyone else ?  
Or just a fake ?  
Me I don't know what to think anymore  
Don't know where to start  
To sit here with you and talk about nothing  
Is breaking my heart.  
  
Ask me a question ?  
Gimme a smoke  
What are you drinking ?  
Is it a joke  
Well ain't it worth it ?  
Or am I depraved ?  
You hold your head high  
With one foot in the grave.  
  
Aha  
Aha.  
Aha  
Aha.
