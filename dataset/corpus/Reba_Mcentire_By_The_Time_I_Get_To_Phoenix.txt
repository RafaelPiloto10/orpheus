By the time I get to Phoenix he'll be risin'  
He'll find the note I left hangin' on his door  
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that man so many times before  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be workin'  
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma he'll be sleepin'  
He'll turn softly and call my name out low  
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him  
Though time and time I've tried to tell him so  
Oh, he just didn't know I would really go  
I would really go
