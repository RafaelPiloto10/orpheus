(Dewey Bunnell)  
  
Would it matter to you  
If we just took a walk  
To see where this path leads to  
Maybe stop in awhile  
Lay down, see you smile  
Looking up at those clouds in view  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
With the snow in your hair  
A crystal halo you wear  
While the chill winter air streams through  
Amid the birch and the oak  
Smell the fireplace smoke  
And the warmth we will go home to  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
Oh whoa...  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
Being alone with you
