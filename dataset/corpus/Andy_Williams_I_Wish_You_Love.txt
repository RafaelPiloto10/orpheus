Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends,  
Never lovers ever friends.  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away,  
I sincerely want to say.  
  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing,  
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love.  
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade,  
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love.  
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be,  
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.  
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,  
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love.  
  
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,  
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, hot time, I wish you love.  
All kinds of love, a whole gang of love.
