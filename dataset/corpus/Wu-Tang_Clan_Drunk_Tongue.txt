I don't give a damn!  
I'll kill anyone in my way  
  
Homicide city shit  
Homicide city shit  
Yeah yeah, homicide, yo  
You see the neck lit, fist glisten, chain drippin', lane shiftin'  
Riding dirty dirty, got that thang, know I stay grippin'  
Facin' life with it or without it bitch it's same difference  
Lames drippin' if it's day or night, I'ma bang with it  
Situation's sickenin' niggas broke, and they can't fix it  
Dough is all I know so if you slip it, then I can't miss it  
Ain't mention Sin and broke niggas, in the same sentence  
Got the game twisted, mayne listen, say pimpin'  
What you pushin'? Product pumpin' like a piston hardly gettin' by  
Or probably gettin' high off what you pitchin', while we sittin' fly  
Tryin' to keep it simplified, movin' like we Semper Fi  
My niggas is born to ride, y'all niggas get sent to die  
All you do is mention I, general exemplify  
Sin City been gritty, ten city enterprise  
About to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind  
And improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high  
You don't want the semi flyin' nine at your Hemi fine  
All you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time  
Mad 'cause my ones up, and scared 'cause my guns bust  
God's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumb fucks  
Sin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps  
Hit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks  
Dodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug thugs out  
The bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch  
Glock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust  
Rug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush  
Dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us  
Your back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us  
Stack bread like Wonder from the winter 'til the summer come  
Upgrade to made, that's when the Benzs and the Humers come  
I ain't want no Humer stunt, ask how I stack well like Maxwell  
Nigga tryin' do a little some'n some'n
