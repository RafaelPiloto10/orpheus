Running to fight  
Spirit in the night  
Like a dog to bite  
Everything in sight  
Give me love you say  
There's a price you have to pay  
With momma's life you cannot play  
Make things right you need to be saying...  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
  
Fists come to town  
Blood on the ground  
Momma's crying, 'Lord have mercy! '  
Mercy's hard to find  
It's just a state of mind  
Drop the..., get out the way  
We don't have another day  
  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
  
He said he's comng by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you hear me let me know woa woa woa woa  
  
Right is right, wrong is wrong (three times)  
  
He said he's coming by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you here me let me know  
The world is full of woa!
