You come over, don't talk,  
Turn the tv on off,  
Disconnected, I'm affected,  
Better take the call  
Showed you pictures of my hometown,  
A pin could drop from miles down,  
What's the use in tryin' to be a girlfriend, when I know just what we are  
  
There's nothing, in common, except the bed we lay on  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers,  
And it's empty in between  
  
Your a hot-lipped, I can't break,  
Disaster to eliminate,  
What part of no do I not understand, when your not good for me  
  
Cuz I know we will never, be some kind of forever  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers, and it's empty in between,  
Cuz I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing,  
How did we become a one night stand,  
Hanging on a thread just isn't something,  
That I wan't in the end  
  
It's empty in between  
  
You come over, now it's over,  
Yeah I know just what we are  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers,  
And it's empty in between,  
Cuz I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing,  
How did we become a one night stand,  
Hanging on a thread just isn't something,  
That I wan't in the end  
  
No, whoa it's empty in between
