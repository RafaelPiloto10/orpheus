I don't believe what you said  
I can go anywhere  
I can hold my head up  
I can breathe in the air  
I'm not officially dead  
I still have a heart  
I'm not officially dead, yeah  
I still have a heart  
Do you remember the times  
You ride my bike past my house  
I want to know you so bad  
Know you inside and out  
You're officially dead  
You don't have a heart  
You're officially dead, yeah  
You don't have a heart  
You're officially dead  
You don't have a heart  
You're officially dead  
(see me, feel me, touch me, please me)  
Was it easy just to leave me  
Just to leave me dead  
I know you can't let me go  
It's all in your head  
You want me back in your arms  
Back in your bed  
We're officially dead  
We don't have a heart  
We're officially dead  
We don't have a heart [Repeat x4]  
Officially dead  
We're officially dead [Repeat x2]  
Officially dead [Repeat x3]
