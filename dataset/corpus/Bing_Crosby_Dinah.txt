Dinah  
Is there anyone finer  
In the state of Carolina?  
If there is and you know her  
Show her to me.  
Dinah  
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'  
How I love to sit and gazin'  
To the eyes of Dinah Lee.  
Every night why do I  
Shake with fright?  
Cause my Dinah might  
Change her mind about me.  
Oh, Dinah  
Should you wander to China  
I would hop an ocean liner  
Just to be with Dinah Lee.  
  
Mills bros repeat verse.  
Bing scats.  
  
Every night why do I  
Shake with fright?  
Cause my Dinah might  
Change her mind about me.  
  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Said it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Snag it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Ah, Tell it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
  
Dinah  
Wander to China,  
The state of Carolina  
Listen, and you know her  
I would like to have you show her to me.  
Dinah  
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'  
How I love to sit and gazin'  
To the eyes of Dinah Lee.  
  
Oh, Dinah  
Should you wander to China  
I would get me an ocean liner  
Just to be with Dinah Lee.
