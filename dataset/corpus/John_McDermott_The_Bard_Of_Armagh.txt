Oh list to the strains of a poor Irish harper  
And scorn not the strings from his poor withered hand  
Oh remember his fingers could once move more sharper  
To raise up the memory of his dear native land  
At fair or at wake I would twist my shillelagh  
Or trip throughout he jig in my brogues bound with straw  
And all the pretty maids in the village and the valley  
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh  
And when Sergeant Daeth in his cold arms shall embrace me  
And lull me to sleep with sweet with sweet Erin go bragh  
By the side of my Kathleen, my young young wife, oh then place me  
Then forget Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh
