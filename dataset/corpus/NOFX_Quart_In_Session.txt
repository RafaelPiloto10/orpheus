It's funny how nothing seems much fun  
Anymore to me now that I quit the drink  
'Cause soberness, it might be what I need  
But it's certainly not how I want to be  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me  
  
Consequence never had anytime to think  
About what coulda, shoulda, happen to me  
see-Common sense my parents said I  
Never had any, but now look whose  
Got the dough  
  
No longer born to lose  
Put away my party shoes  
Missin' the alcohol  
Don't feel like goin' out  
Nothing worth singin' about  
Missin' the alcohol  
Without tonic n gin  
Without no vicodin  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me [Repeat: x4]
