We thought the baby was the answer to keep us happy in our world  
Our prayers were answered with the darling baby girl  
And we named her Heaven but a child's not all it takes  
But I'll stay and I'll stay for heaven's sake  
You often send me roses and kiss me when you leave home  
And you pick out my shirt and tie like nothing's ever wrong  
But we're only fooling heaven we can't make a mistake  
I won't leave you I'll see it through for heaven's sake  
Christmas trees and make believe for heaven's sake  
Ginger mint and let's pretent if that's what it takes  
Evening prayers and pigtails teddy bears and wishing wells for heaven's sake  
Rollers case and skinned up knee and dirty face  
I kiss her hurt until her tears are all erased  
Baby dolls and your high heels lollipops before her meal for heaven's sake
