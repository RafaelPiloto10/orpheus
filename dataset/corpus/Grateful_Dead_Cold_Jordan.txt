Oh, sinning is a gentilized journey  
Take Jesus as your daily guide  
Though you may feel pure and saintly  
Without Him walking by your side  
And when you come to make your crossing  
At the end of the pilgrim's way  
If you ever will meet your Savior  
You will surely meet Him on that day  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at its deep water  
Look at that wide river  
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll  
You better take Jesus with you  
He's a true companion  
Oh, I'm sure without Him  
That you never will make it home  
That awful day of judgment  
Is coming in the by and by  
We'll see our Lord descending  
In the glory from on high  
Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus  
And in the special love of God  
And maybe ever get ready  
When he comes on Jordan's tide  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at its deep water  
Look at that wide river  
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll  
You better take Jesus with you  
He's a true companion  
Oh, I'm sure without Him that  
You never will make it home  
Now what you gonna do?  
Oh, what you gonna say?  
Oh, how you gonna feel  
When you come to the end of the way?
