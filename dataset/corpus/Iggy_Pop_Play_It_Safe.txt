Say Ta  
Eisenhower saw the thing  
He said this is sickening  
I swear I saw the very thing  
I saw it in America  
  
Let's play safe  
I never knew how  
How to play safe  
You told me how  
how to play safe  
A thousand times  
  
I don't believe in fairies any more  
  
Today I saw a very very thing  
But that's another song  
You're too simple minded  
Let's play it safe  
  
What do we have in common?  
Play it safe  
What do we have in common?  
Play it safe  
  
I want to be a criminal  
Play it safe
