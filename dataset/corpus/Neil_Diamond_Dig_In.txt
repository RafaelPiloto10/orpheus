Dig in, Papa's coming home  
Dig in girl, Papa's coming home  
You know that soon, girl  
We'll be making up for time  
I've been gone  
  
Hang loose,  
Papa's on his way  
Hang loose child,  
Papa's on his way  
And when I get to you,  
I'll give you everything  
Every day  
  
Dig in, I say, dig in, girl  
Anyway, come on,  
Come on, come on  
Sing out, Papa's coming home  
Sing out child,  
Papa's coming home  
Gonna make some time  
For giving you girl  
Every little thing you want  
  
Oh dig in  
Go, I say dig in  
Do it baby  
Anyway I say  
Oh come on  
Dig in, hang loose, sing out
