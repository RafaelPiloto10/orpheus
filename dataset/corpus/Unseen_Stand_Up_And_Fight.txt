The 90's are almost over and hatred still runs deep  
Ignorant fucks in police suits still rule the fucking streets  
The poor getting poorer while the rich stay fucking rich  
Equality is no where in sight if you want to win you gotta fight  
  
Stand up and fight  
  
What the hell are we supposed to do?  
Violence and despair are threating to destory the youth  
Everyday on the news more murder more rape  
We're living in a dying world from which there's no escape  
  
What the hell are we supposed to do?  
What the fuck are we gonna do?  
Living in a violent world with no hope for the youth
