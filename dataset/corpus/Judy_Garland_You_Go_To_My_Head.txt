You go to my head  
And you linger like a haunting refrain  
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain  
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.  
  
You go to my head  
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew  
And I find the very mention of you  
Like the kicker in a julep or two.  
  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might give a thought to my plea  
Casts a spell over me  
Till I say to myself  
  
Get ahold of yourself!  
Can't you see that it never can be?  
You go to my head  
With a smile that makes my temperature rise  
  
Like a summer with a thousand Julys.  
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes.  
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost of a chance  
  
In this crazy romance,  
You go to my head.
