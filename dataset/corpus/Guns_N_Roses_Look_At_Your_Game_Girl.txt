There's a time for a living  
Time keeps on flying  
Think you're loving baby  
But all your doing is crying  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Look at your game, girl  
  
What a mad delusion  
Living in that confusion  
Frustration and doubt  
Can you ever live without the game?  
  
The sad, sad game  
Mad game  
Just to say loves' not enough  
Even it can't be true  
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby, but you're only fooling you  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Go on look at your game, girl  
  
And if you can't feel  
And those feelings aint real  
Then you better, stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
  
That's the game  
Sad sad game  
Mad game  
Sad game
