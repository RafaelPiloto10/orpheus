This time is special for you  
I don't think you ever fell for someone like I do  
Every now and then I think of you  
But this time is time for rock on  
Hey, do you remember the time I took you after class?  
I think you were going to find something special of me  
But then when you turned around you broke my heart like a glass  
I think you should never be like that to someone like me  
This time I will let you down  
This time I will never give you to  
This time I will set you free  
And only tonight you will be mine  
Every now and then I think about you  
And this pain is making me feel so  
Alive is the word but I think better off  
Without you I would be  
I damn you my sweet blue eye darlin'  
I couldn't stop sinking for you  
Even if you never let me be  
The man you wanted to see  
My sweet blue eye darlin'  
My sweet blue eye darlin'  
My sweet blue eye darlin'  
My sweet blue eye darlin'  
My sweet blue eye darlin'
