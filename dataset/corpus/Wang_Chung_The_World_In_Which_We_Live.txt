(wang chung)  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Fuck, shit, screw everybody, don't care, swear  
Do things without a care, are seen everywhere  
And write about each other  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Can't afford to eat, can't make ends meet  
Got nowhere to sleep, can't feel the heat  
Can't get out  
Can't find a voice to scream it out  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
Chorus:  
The world is a mosaic upon a golden floor  
Moving silently, darkly through space  
And our lives are the fragments and all that's gone before  
Broken jewels in excrement base  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Get up, stand up, speak up, fight  
And do all the things that they think are necessary and right  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Believe what they hold to be true, to be true for everybody  
Repeat chorus  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live
