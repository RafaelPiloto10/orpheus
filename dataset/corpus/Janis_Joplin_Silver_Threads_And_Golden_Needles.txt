Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.  
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.  
Go ahead!  
  
I don't want your golden mansions with a tear in every room,  
All I want's the love you promised, beneath the halo moon.  
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin' game.  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.  
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.
