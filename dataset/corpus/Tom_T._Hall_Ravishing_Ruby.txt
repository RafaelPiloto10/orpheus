Ravishing Ruby, she'd been around for awhile  
Ravishing Ruby, she was a truckstop child  
Born in the back of a rig somewhere near L.A.  
Ravishing Ruby, you poured a lot of hot coffee in your day  
Ravishing Ruby, believe anything you say  
  
Just like her daddy said, said he'd be back someday  
She was just fourteen, she grew up wild and free  
And all the time she'd be waitin' on him, she'd been waiting on you and me  
Ravishing Ruby, she sleeps in a bunk out back  
  
Her days and nights are filled with dreams of a man named Smilin' Jack  
That was her daddy's name and that's all she ever knew  
Ravishing Ruby ain't got time for guys like me and you  
Ravishing Ruby, a beautiful young girl now  
Ravishing Ruby, she made a solemn vow  
  
Waitin' on Smilin' Jack, he'll come rollin' by  
And she wants to see him, she wants to touch him either way, dead or alive  
Ravishing Ruby, she sleeps in a bunk out back  
Her days and nights are filled with dreams of a man named Smilin' Jack  
  
That was her daddy's name and that's all she ever knew  
Ravishing Ruby ain't got time for guys like me and you
