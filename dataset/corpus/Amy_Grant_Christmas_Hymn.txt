Praise to God whose love was shown  
Who sent his Son to earth  
Jesus left his rightful throne  
Became a man by birth  
  
The virgin's baby son  
All creation praised Him  
God incarnate come  
Come to Bethlehem  
  
Still a higher call had He  
Deliverance from our sins  
Come to set all people free  
From Satan's hold within  
  
For by the sin of man we fell  
By the Son of God  
He crushed the power of Hell  
Death we fear no more  
  
Now we stand with strength, with power  
The sons of God on earth  
Faithful to the final hour  
Christ's righteousness our worth  
  
And now all praise is given  
For the babe, the Son  
The Savior King is risen  
Christ is Lord indeed  
  
For the babe, the Son  
The Savior King is risen  
Christ is Lord indeed
