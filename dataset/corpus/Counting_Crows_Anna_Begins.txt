My friend assures me "it's all or nothing"  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
My friend implores me: "For one time only make an exception"  
I am not not worried  
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
With the status of my emotions "Oh", She says, "You're changing."  
  
But we're always changing  
It does not bother me to say this isn't love  
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love  
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that  
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between  
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean  
  
My friend assures me "It's all or nothing"  
But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned  
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget  
I am not worried  
"If it's love", she said, "then were gonna have to think about the  
consequences"  
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....  
  
This time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind  
"These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days" she says  
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore  
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore  
It seems like I should say "as long as this is love..."  
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:  
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album  
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before  
But then I start to think about the consequences  
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...  
  
The time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind  
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and  
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
She's talking in her sleep  
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn  
And every word is nonsense but I understand and  
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Her kindness bangs a gong  
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away  
It's chasing me away  
She disappears and  
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing
