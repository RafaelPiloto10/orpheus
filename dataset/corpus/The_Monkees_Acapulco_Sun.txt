Acapulco sun, leaving work undone  
Dream about the nighttime till she comes  
She'll take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet (oh so sweet)  
And the words she's saying are so simple and complete  
"I love you, truly do."  
  
Acapulco sun, tells me she's the one  
Dream about the sunset till she comes  
She'll take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet (oh so sweet)  
And the words she's saying are so simple and complete  
"I love you, truly do."  
  
Acapulco sun, leaving work undone  
Dream about the night time till she comes
