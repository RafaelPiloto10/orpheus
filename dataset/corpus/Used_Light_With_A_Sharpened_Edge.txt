Free from the torment of sin  
All this I'm giving up  
Much as the sun would decide to give in  
Exploding to orange  
And hear all the voices sing praises and hymns  
Mark the birth of a change  
Free from the torment of sin  
All this I'm giving up  
  
It's not me  
Buried wreckage my soul  
It's not me so who am I now  
  
Over and over again  
Light with a sharpened edge  
Cut through the black empty space we call sky  
Beginning the cycle that stays  
And I know in my heart we all die  
Like the day and the night  
Like the sun in the sky  
All this I'm giving up  
  
It's not me  
Buried wreckage my soul  
It's not me so who am I now?  
  
Is there another side?  
Beat out the black and white  
Place I could meet you by  
A place on the other side  
I'll let you know when I go  
When I'm gone  
  
It's not me  
Buried wreckage my soul  
It's not me so who am I now?
