Guilty as sin, yes I confess  
I can't deny  
Strong in the heart, weak in the flesh  
I never meant to do you wrong  
  
I swear the soul gets blistered along the way  
But when you hurt the things you love  
You gotta know  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
Of those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above  
  
Can't hide the truth, I stand accused  
Don't ask me why  
I question every move and thought I had  
That's going on inside  
  
I swear the soul gets blistered along the way  
But when you hurt the things you love  
You gotta know  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
All those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty  
And if it's wrong to feel this right  
I can't help it and I won't fight  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above  
  
It's not my first offense and it won't be the last  
I would not change a thing except what's in the past  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
All those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty of loving you  
If you mean hope (guilty), if you mean fear, never said I was innocent  
(Heal me)  
Wrap your arms around me  
If you mean, if you mean love and it's you that I want  
And I won't fight  
And if it's wrong, it feels right  
Guilty, guilty
