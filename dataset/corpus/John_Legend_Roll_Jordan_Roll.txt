Roll Jordan, roll  
Roll Jordan, roll  
I want to get to  
Heaven when I die  
To hear Roll Jordan roll  
Roll Jordan, roll  
Roll Jordan, roll  
I want to get to  
Heaven when I die  
To hear Roll Jordan roll  
  
My brother you ought  
To been there  
Yes, my Lord  
A sitting in the kingdom  
To see Roll Jordan roll  
  
Roll Jordan, roll  
Roll Jordan, roll  
I want to get to  
Heaven when I die  
To hear Roll Jordan roll  
  
My mother, you ought  
To been there  
Yes, my Lord  
A sitting in the kingdom  
To see Roll Jordan roll  
  
Roll Jordan, roll  
Roll Jordan, roll  
I want to get to  
Heaven when I die  
To hear Roll Jordan roll  
I want to get to  
Heaven when I die  
To see Roll Jordan roll
