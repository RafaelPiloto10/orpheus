I look to the east when the day  
Is done and think of it all  
All the thoughts that I've seen of  
Satin seams and tide pool dreams  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I try to recall  
But I find myself yawning  
I guess they are gone but there's more  
So I head out the door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
First break in the day if the time  
Is right and nobody minds  
I stroll down the lane take a breath  
Of air and drift on a dream  
I look to the sun  
As the day is warming  
Consider the things  
That have happened before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way
