All my life I've looked at love as a fairy tale  
A woman a man never never land and a storybook ending  
Leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen  
I played em all but always came up empty  
But one of these days I'll be in a movie with 'em  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
There's some one man for someone who believes in love  
To not give up  
Even though you've heard so many say  
That's the way the story goes  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lookin' for a new love story  
I'm lookin' for a yellow brick road  
That'll carry me to his door  
I'm lookin for a new love story  
Oh one that's never been told before  
  
And I have searched the oceans of many a man's eyes  
But I have yet to feel like more than some deserted island  
I know a relationship will come for me in time  
And I can't wait to see his face on my horizon  
Cause one of these days he'll sail into my life  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
There's some one man for someone who believes in love  
To not give up  
Even though you've heard so many say  
That's the way the story goes  
  
[Chorus]
