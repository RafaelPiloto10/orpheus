Turn the music up  
A lil' louder, yeah  
  
You had a lot of crooks try'na steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
Mm you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in the corner try'na put it together  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
  
Mm for a second you were here, now you over there  
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love (had a love)  
Never had love (had a love)  
  
When you was just a youngin', your looks were so precious  
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing  
But you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds  
Without you being insecure  
You never credit yourself so when you got older  
It's seems like you came back ten times over  
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner  
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder  
  
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love (how to love, how to love)  
How to love (how to love, how to love)  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in this corner try'na put it together  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
  
Mm for a second you were here, now you over there  
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love (had a love)  
How to love (how to love)  
  
Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions  
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions  
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions  
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening  
  
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'  
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'  
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'  
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook  
  
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in this corner try'na put it together  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
  
Ooh, see I just want you to know (You to know)  
That you deserve the best  
You're beautiful, you're beautiful  
Yeah, and I want you to know  
You're far from the usual, far from the usual  
  
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in this corner try'na put it together  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
  
Mm, see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love (how to love)  
Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in this corner try'na put it together  
How to love (how to love)  
How to love, mm
