I'm on my way, got no time to waste  
Places to go, people to chase  
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste  
Gotta get away from here  
Twenty-one years from the day I was born  
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn  
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm  
You come to me  
You were the girls with the summer sunshine  
In your eyes and in your smile  
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here  
I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am  
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram  
You can stick my money in an old tin can  
I think I fell in love again  
I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time  
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine  
I was almost gone, I was over the line  
I said what's come over me  
You were the girl with the sound of springtime  
In your songs and in your voice  
You were the one I thought, loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you  
I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes  
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze  
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you  
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away  
Gotta get away, gotta get away
