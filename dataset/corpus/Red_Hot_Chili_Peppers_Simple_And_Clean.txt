You give me many things  
lately your all I need  
you smiled at and said  
  
Don't get me wrong I love you  
but does that mean I have to meet your father  
when we're older you'll understand what I mean't when I said no  
I don't think life is quite that simple  
  
When you walk away  
You don't hear me say please  
Ohh baby don't go  
and simple and clean is the that your making me feel tonight  
Its hard to let it go  
  
Hold me  
Whatever lies beyond thin morning  
Is a little later on  
regraudless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all  
nothings like before
