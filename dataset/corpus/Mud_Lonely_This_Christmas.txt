Try to imagine  
A house that's not a home  
Try to imagine  
A Christmas all alone  
That's where I'll be  
Since you left me  
My tears could melt the snow  
What can I do without you?  
I got no place, no place to go  
  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Without you to hold  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Lonely and cold  
It'll be cold, so cold  
Without you to hold  
This Christmas  
  
Each time I remember  
The day you went away  
and how I would listen  
to the things you had to say  
I just break down  
as I look around  
and the only things I see  
are loneliness and emptiness  
and an unlit Christmas tree  
  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Without you to hold  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Lonely and cold  
It'll be cold, so cold  
Without you to hold  
This Christmas  
  
Do You remember last year (So it'll be so lonely this Christmas)  
When You and I were together  
We never thought there'd be an end  
and I remember looking at you then (Without you to hold)  
and I remember thinking  
That Christmas must have been made for us (It'll be so very lonely)  
Cause Darling this is the time of year  
That you really, you really need love(Lonely and cold)  
When it means so very, very much  
  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Without you to hold  
It'll be lonely this Christmas  
Lonely and cold  
It'll be cold, so cold  
Without you to hold  
This Christmas  
  
It'll be cold, so cold  
Without you to hold  
This Christmas  
  
Merry Christmas, Darling  
Wherever you are
