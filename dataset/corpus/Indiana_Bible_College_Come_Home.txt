[Verse:]  
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling for you, and for me  
See on the portal, He is waiting and watching  
Watching for you and for me saying  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Come home, come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling oh sinner come home  
Come home  
  
[Verse 2:]  
All for a wonderful love He has promised  
Promised for you, and for me  
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon  
Pardon for you and for me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Come home, come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Come home, come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling oh sinner come home  
Come home  
  
[Tag]  
So why should we tarry, when Jesus is pleading  
He pleading for you and for me  
As time is now fleeting, the moments are passing  
Passing from you, and from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Ending]  
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon
