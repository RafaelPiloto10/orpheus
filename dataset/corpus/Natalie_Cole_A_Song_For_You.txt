I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching  
Oh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly  
Oh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me  
Baby, baby, can't you see through me, 'cause we're alone now  
And I'm singing this song to you, you taught me precious secrets  
Of a true love withholding nothing, you came out in front  
When I was hiding, yeah, yeah, but now its so much better  
If my words don't quite come together, please listen to the melody  
'Cause my love is in there somewhere hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine, and when my life is over  
Remember, remember, remember when we were together  
And we are alone now, and I was singing this song to you  
We were alone, and I was singing, yeah singing  
We were alone, and I was singing this song for you  
Singing my song, I'm singing my song for you  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, doo
