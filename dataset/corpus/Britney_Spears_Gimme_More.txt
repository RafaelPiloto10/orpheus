(It's Britney bitch)  
(I see you)  
(And I just want to dance with you)  
  
Every time they turn the lights down  
Just want to go that extra mile for you  
You public display of affection  
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)  
  
We can get down like there's no one around  
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')  
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')  
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'  
They keep watching (They keep watching)  
Keep watching  
  
Feels like the crowd is saying  
  
Gimme, Gimme more  
Gimme, More  
Gimme, Gimme, More

A center of attention (Can you feel them?)  
Even when we're up against the wall  
You've got me in a crazy position (yeah)  
If you're on a mission (uh-uh)  
You got my permission (oh)  
  
We can get down like there's no one around  
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')  
We'll keep on rockin', rockin' (Oh ah ha)  
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'  
They keep watching (They keep watching)  
Keep watching  
  
Feel's like the crowd is saying:
