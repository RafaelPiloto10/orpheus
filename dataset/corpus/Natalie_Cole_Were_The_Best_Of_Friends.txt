When you're the best of friends  
Having so much fun together  
You're not even aware, you're such a funny pair  
You're the best of friends  
Life's a happy game  
You could clown around forever  
Neither one of you sees, your natural boundaries  
Life's one happy game  
If only the world wouldn't get in the way  
If only people would just let you play  
They say you're both being fools  
You're breaking all the rules  
They can't understand, the magic of your wonderland  
Hu-hu-hu  
When you're the best of friends  
Sharing all that you discover  
When that moment has past, will that friendship last?  
Who can say? There's a way!  
Oh I hope... I hope it never ends  
'Cause you're the best of friends
