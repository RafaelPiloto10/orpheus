I watch you sleep  
you're everything I hoped for  
But never dreamed of finding  
I can't believe that all I've ever wanted  
Is lying here beside me  
Hold me now, there's a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight, for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now, I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
So lose control  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
you're safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So I'll hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
you're safe with me  
I'll chase away the nightmares  
I'll shield you 'til the storm  
Runs and you will see  
I'll always leave a light there  
To burn until the dawn comes  
  
Hold me now, there's a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight, for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now, I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
I won't let go  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
you're safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So I'll hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream
