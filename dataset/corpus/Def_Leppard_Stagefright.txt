I said welcome to my show  
It's just a-you and me baby  
We got the whole damn night to go  
  
You're holding out on me, while I'm on fire  
If you can't stand the heat, then you should try  
Victim of my vices, you know you are  
You skate on ice to paradise, stairway to the stars  
  
Stagefright all night, won't you let go  
All night stagefright, on with the show  
  
You come on like a lady dressed to kill  
Never thought you could be caught, but you will  
A little understanding, a little love  
A headline act around the back, is what I'm thinkin' of  
  
Stagefright all night, won't you let go  
All night stagefright, on with the show  
Stagefright all night, you're dream starts today  
All night stagefright, is only a heartbeat away  
  
You're going for my head, you're going down  
Gettin' good at being bad, you're hangin' round  
A fun inspired asylum, toys for the boys  
Love on the rocks, forget-me-nots, you got no choice  
  
Stagefright all night, oh won't you let go  
All night stagefright, get on with the show  
Stagefright all night, you're dream starts today  
All night stagefright, is only a heartbeat away  
  
Stagefright all night, oh won't you let go  
All night stagefright, get on with the show
