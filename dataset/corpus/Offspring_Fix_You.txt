She wakes up  
Rage and grace  
Pulling me closer, pushing away  
And me  
The sharpest thorn on your vine  
Twisting and turning  
We're all intertwined  
  
Broken wing  
Empty glass  
Words that scream and bounce right back  
She says, you know  
We'd all like to rearrange  
  
I wish I could fix you  
And make you how I want you  
I wish I could fix you  
And I wish you could fix me  
  
I wish I could heal you  
And mend where you are broken  
I wish I could heal you  
And I wish you could heal me  
  
HA la la la...  
  
A beaming sunrise buries the night  
The setting sun destroys the light  
The she says, baby  
I've gotta get going  
Cutting each other  
Without even knowing  
  
She sees a million stars  
Like holes in the sky  
All God's tears for her they cry  
And I am in her rain
