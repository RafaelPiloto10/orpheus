Well it's the same old story  
Another mobile home broken up  
Well I'm eatin' off of a paper plate  
Drinkin' from a paper cup  
  
[Chorus:]  
She caught me with another woman  
I guess I'm lucky to be alive  
Well she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
She caught me with another woman  
I guess I'm lucky to be alive  
Well she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive  
Yeah she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive
