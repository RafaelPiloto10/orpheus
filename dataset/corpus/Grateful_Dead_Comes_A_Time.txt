Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand  
Says, "Don't you see?  
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe  
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup  
That only love can fill, only love can fill"  
Been walkin' all mornin', went walkin' all night  
I can't see much difference between the dark and light  
And I feel the wind and I taste the rain  
Never in my mind to cause so much pain  
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand  
Says, "Don't you see?  
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe  
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup  
Only love can fill, only love can fill"  
From day to day just letting it ride  
You get so far away from how it feels inside  
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall  
But the day may come when you can't feel at all  
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand  
Says, "Don't you see?  
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe  
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup  
That only love can fill, only love can fill, only love can fill"
