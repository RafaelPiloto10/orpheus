I could write a book on love  
The way you make me feel  
I never knew someone  
Could have a love so real  
  
Call it a special heart  
Call it a love so true  
But, in a little while I'm getting close to you  
  
See, I'm about to lose my mind  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm so excited, it's a crime  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love  
Real love, oh love  
  
Calling up all my friends  
To tell them how right they've been  
They said you would take me back into your arms again  
Gonna do right this time, I like the way it feels  
I don't wanna ask too much  
Just wanna feel you touch  
  
See, I'm about to lose my mind  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm so excited, it's a crime  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love  
Real love, oh love  
  
I'm all excited  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm so delighted  
(Love is on the way)  
'Cause love is comin'  
(Love is on the way  
And I've been waiting for the day for love to come  
(Love is on the way)  
My heart is flyin'  
(Love is on the way)  
There's no denynig  
(Love is coming)  
Oh love  
  
See, I'm about to lose my mind  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm so excited, it's a crime  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love  
Real love, oh love  
  
I get a second chance today  
(Love is on the way)  
It's really true love and I can say  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love, real love  
  
Well, I'm about to lose control  
(Love is on the way)  
'Cause love is coming, don't you know  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love, real love  
  
I know for sure that this is it  
(Love is on the way)  
Can't talk to you now, there's love to get  
(Love is on the way)  
It's gonna be real love, real love
