Don't really know who sent me  
To raise my voice and say  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day.  
  
I don't know why I come here,  
Knowing as I do,  
What you really think of me,  
What I really think of you.  
  
For the millions in a prison,  
That wealth has set apart  
For the Christ who has not risen,  
From the caverns of the heart  
  
For the innermost decision,  
That we cannot but obey  
For what's left of our religion,  
I lift my voice and pray  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day.  
  
I know I said I'd meet you,  
I'd meet you at the store,  
But I can't buy it, baby.  
I can't buy it anymore.  
  
And I don't really know who sent me,  
To raise my voice and say  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day.  
  
I don't know why I come here,  
Knowing as I do,  
What you really think of me,  
What I really think of you.  
  
For the innermost decision  
That we cannot but obey  
For what's left of our religion  
I lift my voice and pray  
May the lights in The Land of Plenty  
Shine on the truth some day.
