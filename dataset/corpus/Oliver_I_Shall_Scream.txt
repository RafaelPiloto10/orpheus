[Widow corney (spoken)]  
You're a cruel man.  
And a hardhearted man besides.  
  
[Mr. Bumble(spoken)]  
Hardhearted, Mrs. Corney? Hard?  
Are you hardhearted, Mrs. Corney?  
  
[Widow corney (spoken)]  
Dear me! What a curious question coming  
From a single man.  
What can you want to know  
For, Mr. Bumble? Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
No you wouldn't, heigh ho.  
If I wanted something special,  
Then you couldn't say "no".  
Did I nearly catch you smiling?  
Yes I did. And it's beguiling.  
If you hand is close, I'll press it.  
Yes, you like it -- come confess it!  
Yes, you do...  
  
[Widow corney]  
No, I don't.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Yes, you do!  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
'Til they hasten to my rescue, I shall scream.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Since there's nobody that's near us  
Who could see us. Or could hear us?  
If you ask you can I kiss you  
Say what will my pretty miss do?  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream, scream, scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
If I pinch you one pinch -  
From you shy protective shell  
Can I un-inch you one inch?  
Will my blinthesome, buxum beauty  
Let her suitor do his duty?  
Tho' his lap ain't very large, dear  
Sit upon it - There's no charge, dear.  
Will you sit?  
  
[Widow corney]  
No, I shan't  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Will you sit?  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
For the safety of my virtue I shall scream  
Tho' your knee is rather cosy,  
See my cheeks are getting rosy.  
You would have me in your power.  
If I sat here for an hour...  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
I shall scream, scream, scream!  
  
[Widow corney]  
You're a naughty bad man.  
If you think I can't be proper,  
Prim and haughty - I can  
And you'll pardon if I mention  
You must state your true intention.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Is there not another room here?  
  
[Widow corney]  
No!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
If there would be a bride and groom here - would there be?  
  
[Widow corney]  
Well there might.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
We shall see.  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
At the thought of what you're thinking, I shall scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
You will wonder where the scream went  
When we Come to an agreement  
As my lovey-dovey is chubby  
Could she love a chubby hubby  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream, Mr. Bumble!  
I shall scream, Bumble-Wumble!  
I shall scream, scream, scream!
