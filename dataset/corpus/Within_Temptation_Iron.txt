Left in the darkness  
Here on your own  
Woke up a memory  
Feeling the pain  
You cannot deny it  
There's nothing to say  
It's all that you need to find the way  
  
Oh Damn, the war is coming!  
Oh Damn, you feel you want it!  
Oh Damn, just bring it on today!  
  
You can't live without the fire  
It's the heat that makes you strong  
'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
It's the only thing you know  
You're embracing that, never walk away  
Don't walk away  
  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away  
  
Raised in this madness, you're on your own  
It made you fearless, nothing to lose  
Dreams are a drug here, they get in your way  
That's what you need to fight day by day  
  
Oh Damn, the war is coming!  
Oh Damn, you feel you want it!  
Oh Damn, just bring it on today!  
  
You can't live without the fire  
It's the heat that makes you strong  
'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
It's the only thing you know  
You're embracing that, never walk away  
Don't walk away  
  
You need not to fear us  
unless you're a dark heart  
a vile one, who preys on the innocent  
I promise, you can't hide forever in the empty darkness  
for we'll hunt you down  
like the animals you are  
and pull you in the very bowels of hell  
  
Oh Damn, the war is coming!  
Oh Damn, you feel you want it!  
Oh Damn, just bring it on today!  
  
You can't live without the fire  
It's the heat that makes you strong  
'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
It's the only thing you know  
You're embracing that, never walk away  
Don't walk away  
  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away
