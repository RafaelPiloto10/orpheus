They say I need some rogaine to put in my hair  
Work it out at the gym to fit my underwear  
Oakley makes the shades to transform a tool  
You'd hate for the kids to think that you've lost your cool  
  
[Chorus]  
I'ma do the things that I wanna do  
I ain't got a thing to prove to you  
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans  
Excuse my manners if I make a scene  
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like  
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside  
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink  
I don't give a hoot about what you think  
  
Everyone likes to dance to a happy song  
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along  
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts  
Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
  
[Chorus]
