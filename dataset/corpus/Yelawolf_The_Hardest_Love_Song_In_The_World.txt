I usually don't do this, but fuck it  
You know what? (you know what?)  
  
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen  
And I'm from the gutter so believe me  
I've seen some hard things  
You come from where the black flower grows  
I wanted to cut you down and take you home  
Call me Axl Rose  
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro  
Me and you, sipping whiskey, getting drunker than Jack Sparrow  
Is Black Sabbath, how you get mellow huh  
Well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals  
And rock and roll girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl  
This the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
You could get it in with your girl  
You're the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
  
You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac  
You just got to know some words to Fleetwood Mac  
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back  
Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask  
You switch walkers like a switch blade  
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a
grenade  
With that said, let me pull the spandex pants off you with my teeth like Ozzy
did a bat head  
I rock and roll, baby let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries  
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory  
Being the natural born killer that you are  
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car  
Who would bother to bother the general with nothing but snack food  
Shooting everything that moves, dogs and cats too  
Reenact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans  
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Click bang, it's black magic  
I could do better  
Yeah, hardest love song in the world
