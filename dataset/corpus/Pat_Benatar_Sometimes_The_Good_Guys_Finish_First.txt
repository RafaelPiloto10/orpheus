S-you-see-see-E-S-S  
That's the way we spell success  
Will we get it, the answers yes  
S-you-see-see-E-S-S  
Small town boy, so clean he squeaks  
Dressed and polished for the big time dreams  
Got a letter from his ma, and a boyish grin  
Close his eyes one minute, and it'll lead him to the win, Yeah  
You know there's nothin' like heaven that won't get you back  
To you get your ass in gear, and your mind on track  
When wheels start turnin', things start to fall into place  
You'll be surprised what you can do and some talents all it takes  
Yeah  
Chorus:  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes your best is all it takes  
You know that, Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes The Good Guys, Finish First  
Back on logic, turn your head around  
Use the front door and avoid the crowds  
They'll be tryin' to tell you that it can't be done  
Cause the big boys on their own gave us half the fun, hey hey  
(Repeat Chorus Twice)  
The Good Guys, the Good Guys, the Good Guys, Finish First  
(Chorus)  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Walkin' a straight line in reverse  
You know that, Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes The Good Guys, Finish First  
(Chorus)
