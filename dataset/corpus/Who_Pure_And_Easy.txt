There once was a note, pure and easy,  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.  
The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,  
Forever we blend it, forever we die.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
As people assemble,  
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die,  
But killing is really merely scene changer,  
All men are bored with other men's lies.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup,  
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,  
Distortion becomes somehow pure in it's wildness,  
The note that began all can also destroy.  
  
We all know success when we all find our own dreams,  
And our love is enough to knock down any walls,  
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,  
The simple secret of the note in us all.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
There once was a note, pure and easy,  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.  
  
There once was a note, listen (x 18)
