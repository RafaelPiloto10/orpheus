That's the stuff that turns me on  
More than gold and money  
I need sounds loud and rough  
Like the bee the honey my love  
I can't get enough  
  
Move you legs stamp your feet  
The language of your body  
Is right now all need  
To understand you're ready for love  
I can't get enough  
  
Burning lips the taste of life  
High energy hot feelings  
Heavy sounds to feel alright  
And Rock 'n' Roll for Speed Kings my love  
I can't get enough  
We can't get enough
