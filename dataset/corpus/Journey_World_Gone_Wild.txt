See the signs, madness all around us  
Somewhere I hear sirens wailing through the night  
Read The Times, starts to make me wonder is there  
More to life than black and white  
  
I'd never thought I'd question (thought I'd question)  
The doubt I'm seeing everywhere (doubt I'm seeing everywhere)  
Standing here beside me you're the answer (you're the answer)  
When I lose my faith you're there  
  
[Chorus]  
Face the fire, in a world gone wild  
You're the fortress in my life  
Seeing the world through a child's eyes  
They can't fool me now  
I don't believe it's all a world gone wild  
  
It's a lie, the more you get the more you want, it leads to nowhere  
Should have learned by now  
What is life without someone to share  
The mountains that you climb to reach the sky  
With everyone uncertain (everyone uncertain)  
The future's never really clear (never really clear)  
Standing here beside me you're the reason  
I found my faith again with you here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They can't bring me down  
I don't believe it's all a world gone wild  
  
Now you can count on me to keep you safe  
I'll be your shelter from the storm  
Come lay down with me, and let our spirits melt us into one  
  
[Chorus]
