You're my beloved, you're my bride  
To sing over you is my delight  
Come away with me my love  
  
Under my mercy come and wait  
Till we are standing face to face  
I see no stain on you my child  
  
You're beautiful to me  
So beautiful to me  
  
I sing over you my song of peace  
Cast all your care down at my feet  
Come and find your rest in me  
  
I'll breathe my life inside of you  
I'll bear you up on eagle's wings  
And hide you in the shadow of my strength  
  
I'll take you to my quiet waters  
I'll restore your soul  
Come rest in me and be made whole  
  
You're my beloved, you're my bride  
To sing over you is my delight  
Come away with me my love
