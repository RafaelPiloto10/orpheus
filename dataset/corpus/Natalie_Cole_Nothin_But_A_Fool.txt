By B. Amesbury  
So what do you think  
Maybe he'll buy you a drink  
And run his fingers through your hair  
Apologize for having to stare  
But he's never seen such a face  
What's it doing in such a place  
Says he knows a little spot  
That he thinks you'll like a lot  
So he takes you in his car  
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Says it isn't far  
And you end up at his home  
Ah, but you knew that's where you were going  
And he turns his stereo on  
Makes you feel like you belong  
And you end up in his bed  
You're great was all he said  
Chorus:  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think that he cares  
You're nothin' but a fool  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think he cares  
Yeah, yeah  
So he lights a cigarette  
Background repeats: (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Turns on the tv set  
And you just want to be held for a while  
He don't even wanna smile  
So you try to tell a joke  
He just lights another smoke  
It's getting colder in that bed  
You're great was all he said  
Background repeats chorus  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
You silly fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Ah, you're nothin' but great big fool  
If you think he cares  
You're nothin' but a fool, yes you  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think he cares  
Musical Interlude  
Just a silly fool, ha  
Never thought it would happen to you  
Oh, ho, ho, ho  
Background repeats (Hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Now you'd really love stay  
But he says he's got a busy day  
And he'll call you tomorrow night  
You make sure he's got your number right  
He gives you money for a cab ride home  
Suddenly you're all alone  
Waiting for his call  
And you're staring at the wall  
Ah, you're nothin' but a fool  
Background repeats chorus  
If you think that he loves you  
Ah, you're nothin' but a fool  
Silly fool, ha  
You never thought it would happen to you  
(You're nothin' but a fool)  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think that he cares  
You're nothin' but a fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Oh, you're nothin' but a fool  
If you think he cares  
You're nothin' but a fool...
