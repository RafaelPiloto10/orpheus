You grip your hands around my throat  
And you strip the buttons off my coat  
And I choose the methods I do best  
And the thump-thumps are thumping in you chest  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
You leave these marks upon my neck  
And they're still there  
I know but I still check  
  
And the thump-thumps are thumping in my chest  
As I loose the feeling in my fingertips  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
Now that you're dear to me  
Please check your clothing at the door  
And who you're supposed to be  
You always leave me wanting more  
Now that you're dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Now that you're dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Shall we get intimate again?  
I think so, I think so  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Now that you're dear to me, me  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver (ooh oh, ooh oh)  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver, shiver
