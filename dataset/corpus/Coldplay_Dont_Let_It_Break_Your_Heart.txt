And if I lost the map  
If I lost it all  
I fell into the trap  
Then she goes  
  
When you're tired of waiting you just  
Find you never had to stop  
Come on baby, don't let it break your heart  
  
Those heavenly regrets  
Still on me though  
Trying to catch a cannonball  
And so burning tired  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh through my veins is flowing  
From a shipwreck I heard a call  
Well she said  
  
When you're tired of aiming your arrows  
Still you'll never hit the mark  
Oh-oh-oh even if your aims are shadows  
Still we never gonna part  
  
Come on baby don't let it  
Break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart  
  
Don't let it break your heart
