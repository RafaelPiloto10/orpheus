He sees her at the same time every night  
At the Mexican discotheque  
She gives him french kisses  
He gives her french cigarettes  
They sit at the same table every time  
The lights are low  
But their eyes shine  
Just digging the music  
From those sweet soul bands  
  
She keeps him outta fights  
Holds on to his hand  
He whispers slowly "tonight's the night"  
Months of planning so it's gotta be right  
Under the table her bag is busting at the seams  
She made sure to bring everything  
  
Moonlighting they're leaving everything  
Moonlighting they're losing all their friends  
Moonlighting it's the only way  
It's frightening but it means they'll stay  
Together they're gonna make it together  
  
His blue Morris van is parked in an alley  
Just by Montague street  
His friend Eddie he did the respray  
So he couldn't drive it all last week  
And it cost most of the money  
That he had saved up  
To pay Eddie's receipt  
But he figures it's worth it  
Cause the disguise is a must  
When they go missing  
They're gonna look for the van first  
She whispers slowly "it'll be alright"  
I took some cash from my building society  
And my monthly check came in just right  
If only they knew they weren't giving it away  
  
9:15 Monday morning at the printing works  
The boss notices someone's not clocked in  
And the water department  
Of the council offices has a message  
That Mrs. Park's daughter is missing  
Meanwhile the Carlisle turnoff of the m6 motorway  
Drinking cold black coffee eating hot cup cakes  
She stares at him with his beard unshaved  
Wonders at his powers of staying awake  
He whispers slowly "you did just fine"  
They shared the driving all through the night  
She laughs "my mother will have lost her mind  
We're only ten miles to Gretna  
They're three hundred behind
