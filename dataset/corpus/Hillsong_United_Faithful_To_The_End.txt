Faithful to the End  
  
I'm saved from the grace that I've found in You  
All that you've done  
Through the Power of the Cross for me  
I'm saved of the mercy I've found in You  
All that You're  
The fullness of Your Love For me  
  
Chorus:  
All that I have  
Has come from Your hand  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful to the end  
  
I'll tell of the wonders I've found in You  
And the love that You shown  
Is higher than the heaven above me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
More than this world.  
Could take me from Your love  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful to the end
