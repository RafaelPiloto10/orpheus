I see you go  
Through a park in a haze  
And I don't listen  
For traffic going the same way  
A simple system, yeah  
I string 'em up  
I cut 'em down  
Dare I say  
  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
  
A perfect vision  
Some simple ways to let you know  
Free range humans all cooped up  
Naked clone is playing lame, yeah  
I string 'em up  
I cut 'em down  
Dare I say  
  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to
