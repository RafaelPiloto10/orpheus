I gotta find out what's in my mind,  
I'm a little mixed up but it feels so fine.  
Why does love have to come and go,  
If it's got to leave why does it go so slow?  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is.  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels.  
Tell it to my baby.  
  
I have a feelin' that I'm goin' insane,  
I've fallen in love but can't remember her name.  
She probably stepped out and she's coming back again,  
but if I don't know her how can I let her in?  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is.  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels.  
Tell it to my baby.  
  
Fine!  
So fine!)  
  
How could this ever have happened this way?  
Well, sometimes love turns out that way.  
Sometimes it's cold and sometimes it's hot,  
But it's better to have it than to need it and not!
