Wesley 'Sox' Wilson  
If I call three times a day  
Come and drive my blues away  
When you come, be ready to play  
Do your duty  
  
If you want to have some love  
Give your baby your last buck  
Don't come quackin' like a duck  
Do your duty  
  
I heard you say you didn't love me  
Numb as Mrs. Brown  
I don't believe a word they say  
She's the lyinest woman in town  
  
When I need attention at home  
I'll call you on the phone  
Come yourself, don't send your friend Jones  
Do your duty  
  
If my radiator get too hot  
Cool it off in lots of spots  
Give me all the service you've got  
Do your duty  
  
If you don't know what it's all about  
Don't sit around my house and pout  
If you do you'll catch your mama tippin' now  
Do your duty  
  
If you make your own bed hard  
That's the way o' life  
I'm tired of sleepin' by myself  
But you too dumb to realize  
  
I'm not tryin' to make you feel blue  
I'm not satisfied with the way you do  
I've got to help you find somebody too  
Do your duty
