Today I'm gonna write a sad song  
Gonna make it really long  
So that everyone can see  
That I'm very unhappy  
  
I wish I wasn't always wrong  
I wish it wasn't always my fault  
The finger that your pointing has knocked me on my knees  
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry  
  
It's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.  
  
I wonder what my mom and dad would say  
If I told them that I cry each day  
It's hard enough to live so far away  
  
I wish I wasn't always cold  
I wish it wasn't always alone  
When the party is over how will I get home?  
  
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry  
It's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.  
  
If all the rules are meant to bend  
And you swore you were my friend  
Now I have to start all over again  
  
Cause no ones going to take your place  
And I'm scared I'll never save  
All the pieces of the love we made.  
  
And I'm so sorry, it's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that I can slip and fall  
  
And you won't let me go just to let me know  
That growing up goes slow.  
  
And I'm so sorry, Its not like me  
Its maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow
