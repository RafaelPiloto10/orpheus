Billy we've come along way together and through it all  
You've been just like a brother to me  
And Billy we've had our share of ups and downs  
Froze our tails sleeping on the ground  
When the jobs were few and far between.  
  
We've been knocking around together so long  
Singing them same old songs  
Been out in the rain so long I swear we're shrinking  
Billy lately I have done some thinking.  
  
When I look back on our lives  
We've sure had ourself a time  
But you know it's been a wild world we traveled  
And it's startin' to unravel.  
  
We leave so many loose ends behind  
We've been bucked off and kicked so many times  
And the ground just keeps gettin' harder  
Billy you know well as I we ain't gettin' no younger.  
  
Billy another summer's come and gone  
Now with winter coming on  
I know we planned on heading south  
But Billy I thought about it several days  
And these words I'm about to say.  
  
They don't taste good in my mouth  
But there's someone who's waiting back home  
Lord, if she'll still have me  
Guess I'll be saying so long you go on without me.  
  
Ain't no easy way of saying goodbye  
So be sure and tell 'em all down in Texas I said hi
