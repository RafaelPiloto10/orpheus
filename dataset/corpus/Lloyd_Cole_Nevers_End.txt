If I ever was, then now i'm less than sure  
What I was waiting for  
If I could find the strenght to walk  
Me i'm drinking the sea  
She will send me to sleep  
Surely there must be an easy way  
And i'll say it again will the nevers end  
Do I have to forgive to forget  
I wrote a letter only yesterday  
I can not recall what I wanted to say  
I saw a chance, I let it pass me by  
This is the shallow age, my friend  
I say never again will the nevers end  
This is not what I had meant to say  
So i'm drinking the sea, trying to pick up the pieces  
And say it never again  
If I ever was then now i'm less than sure  
And this is the shallow age, my friend
