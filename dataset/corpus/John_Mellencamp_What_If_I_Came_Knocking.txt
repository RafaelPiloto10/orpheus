What if I came knocking  
On your front door some night?  
Would you open the window  
And drop me down the key?  
What if I came knocking  
On your bedpost that same night?  
Would you open up your heart  
Or try to get the best of me?  
  
What if I came knocking  
On your brain the next day  
And ask for your truth and your love and your honesty?  
Would you build up your big walls  
And try to hide behind that smile  
Or would you try to pull the wool right over me?  
  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came kicking  
And it scared you a little bit  
And I came on strong  
Would you think  
That there's something wrong with me?  
Or could it be your fears  
Of trying something real  
Or just afraid to touch  
A guy like me?  
  
What if I came knocking?  
What if I came knocking?  
What if I came knocking  
On your front door some night? Ahh  
  
So let's just say it worked out  
Like a storybook dream  
And we lived happily ever after  
Fa la la la  
But what if I came crying  
After just a few weeks  
And said I misread my heart  
This is not really meant to be? yeah  
  
So if you hear some knocking  
On your window tonight  
You can bet that it's probably me  
But let it be known  
That we're just a pair of tumbling dice  
And the outcome of these crap shoots  
Is hard to see  
  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking  
On your front door tonight? Ahh  
So what if I came knocking?  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Kick, kick, kick  
What if I came knocking  
On your front porch tonight, tonight?
