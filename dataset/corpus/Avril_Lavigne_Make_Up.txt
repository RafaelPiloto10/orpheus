Layin' on the couch just,  
Hangin' with my boys  
We're chillin' up the house tonight  
I'm being myself  
I'm nobody else 'cause  
This is what we do alright  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not wearing any make-up,  
Won't hide who I am,  
I'll be what I am  
I'm just being honest with my self once again  
I'm my only friend  
  
Kickin' off my shoes  
I'm strummin' my guitar  
I'm singin' songs about my life  
If I could tell the truth  
I'd tell you what I meant by  
Me, myself, and I  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more mirrors  
No more vanity  
Give it all away for free  
Donate to charity  
I am happy in my skin  
I try, in my heart it's not the same  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight
