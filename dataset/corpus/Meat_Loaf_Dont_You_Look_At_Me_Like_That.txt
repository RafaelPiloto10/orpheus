I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes  
Like a little girl I once knew  
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street  
You walk with me, and I walk with you  
  
Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense  
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again  
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again  
And it just can't be, like it was once before  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
(No, I never could turn away from you)  
  
[Chorus]
