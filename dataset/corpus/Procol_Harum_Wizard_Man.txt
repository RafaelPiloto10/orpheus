Wizard man's got a magic tooth  
Carry it low but keep it loose  
Don't wait for christmas when the four winds blow  
When they carry you out you're gonna have to go  
Wizard man's got a pocketful of lead  
Keep a clear eye and a steady head  
Don't wait for christmas 'cause it's bound to snow  
When they carry you out you're gonna have to go  
Wizard man's got an angel's heart  
Show it slow but do it sharp  
Don't wait for christmas join a travelling show  
When they carry you out you won't want to go
