Baby, you know I heard the neighbors say  
Baby, you might be leavin' me today  
Oh yeah, mmm, someone's come along and shared your time  
Don't care, no I don't, no  
But you can't be his and still be mine, so  
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby  
Ooh, got to choose  
Sometimes, oh sometimes, I know you need a change of pace  
Oh yeah, but I ain't gonna run no race  
Baby, you've got to tell me yes or no  
Alright, alright, come on and tell me  
Tell me if you're gonna go, come on  
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby  
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby  
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby  
Ooh, got to choose, got to choose  
Who's your baby, who's your baby  
Who's your baby, who's your baby
