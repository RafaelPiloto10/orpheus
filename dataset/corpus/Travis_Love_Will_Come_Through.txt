If I told you a secret  
You won't tell a soul  
Will you hold it and  
Keep it alive  
  
Cause it's burning a hole  
And I can't get to sleep  
And I can't live alone  
In this lie  
  
So look up, take it away  
Don't look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
And you stand at the crossroads  
Of highroads and low roads  
And I've got a feeling  
It's right  
  
If it's real what I'm feeling  
There's no make believing  
The sound of the wings  
Of the flight  
  
Of a dove, take it away  
Don't look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
Oh, look up, take it away  
Don't look down  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
Love will come through  
Love will come through  
Love will come through
