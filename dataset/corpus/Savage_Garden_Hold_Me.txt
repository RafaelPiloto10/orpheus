Hey if we can't find a way out of these problems  
Then maybe we don't need this  
Standing face to face  
Enemies at war we build defenses  
And secret hiding places  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man  
  
Hey more than angry words I hate this silence  
It's getting so loud  
Well I want to scream  
But bitterness has silenced these emotions  
It's getting hard to breathe  
So tell me isn't happiness  
Worth more than a gold and diamond ring?  
I'm willing to do anything  
To calm the storm in my heart  
I've never been the praying kind  
But lately I've been down upon my knees  
Not looking for a miracle  
Just a reason to believe  
  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man  
  
Do you remember not long ago?  
When we used to live for the night-time  
Cherish each moment  
Now we don't live we exist  
We just run through our lives  
So alone  
That's why you've got to hold me  
  
Hey, if we can't find a way out of these problems  
Then maybe we don't need this  
Standing face to face  
Enemies at war we build defenses  
And secret hiding places  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man
