Nothing I must do  
Nowhere I should be  
No one in my life  
To answer to, but me  
No more candlelights  
No more purple skies  
No one to be near  
As my heart slowly dies  
  
Chorus:  
If I could hold you one more time  
Like in the days when you were mine  
I'd look at you  
Till I was blind  
So you would stay  
I'd say a prayer each time you sign  
Cradle the moments like a child  
I'd stop the world if only i  
Could hold you one more time  
Mmmmmm. . .  
  
I've memorized your face  
I know your touch by heart  
Still lost in your embrace  
I dream of where you are  
  
Chorus
