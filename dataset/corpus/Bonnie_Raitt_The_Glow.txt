I need a drink  
Don't want to think  
I drink too much  
But who's to say  
What's right or wrong?  
  
I guess you think you see  
You're tellin' me  
That I don't know  
When it's passed the point  
Of feelin' good  
I run around and find  
I just can't get satisfied  
Tonight  
  
Now there's a phone  
I hear the sound  
I needed to talk  
But it's too late  
For talkin' now  
  
I guess I'll go alone  
I feel a glow  
Here I am  
Here I am  
Here I am  
What I need is a friend tonight  
What I need is a friend  
What I need is someone  
What I really deed is just one more drink  
Tonight  
Tonight
