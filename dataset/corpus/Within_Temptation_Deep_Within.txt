Is there a place deep within  
A place where you hide your darkest sins  
There's a strange kind of ambiance,  
It's surrounding you  
As a songstress you lure me,  
Towards the truth  
  
Candles die down as you leave the room  
In my heart you leave no gloom  
As you lure me I know the truth  
You're a leprechaun, I see you through  
  
Is there a place deep within  
A place where you hide your darkest sins  
There's a strange kind of ambiance,  
It's surrounding you  
As a songstress you lure me,  
Towards the truth
