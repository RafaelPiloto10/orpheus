Say it's alright Joe  
  
Say it's alright Joe,  
I need another drink  
To blow on the glass so I know I'm alive  
  
Play me a song Joe  
To fill the hours till morning  
Then never again will I bother you  
Ooh, build myself a tower  
No way in no way out.  
Then my friends can visit me  
Once in a while.  
  
Say it's alright Joe.  
I need some reassurance  
You never know what you might find in the night.  
Ooh I'm just a busy bee, still alone in my hive,  
I'm looking for some other world  
To dream out my dreams.  
  
There were kings who were laughing in the rain  
And they told me I'd come here to lead the parade  
All the colors were changing, the sky was in ruins  
The lights are all shining on me and on you  
Shine on  
  
Say it's alright Joe  
The night will soon be over  
And nothing and no one will ever know.  
Open my eyes Joe  
I'd like to see the daylight  
The clock on the wall says it's time to leave.  
Never seen the same face twice  
Never walked the same way  
The little love that I have known  
I keep to myself.  
  
If there's a fire it's asleep in my bed  
I must leave it to burn until it burns itself out  
Catch as you can I'm not staying here long  
I'll be coming back early or never at all  
Shine on
