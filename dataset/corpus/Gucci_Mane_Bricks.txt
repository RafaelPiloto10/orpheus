Intro (Yo Gotti)  
It's ya boy yo gotti  
Chea  
Gucci Mane La Flare  
My nigga Ralph in here  
Zaytoven on the beat nigga  
And it's a street nigga holiday  
My nigga D. J Holiday

Chorus (Gucci Mane)  
Bricks  
All white bricks  
Off white bricks  
Light tan bricks  
Just hit a lick, For 50 more bricks  
Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks  
Bricks  
36 zips  
That's a whole chick  
Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks  
Yea that make sense  
Yea I make hits  
But I still take bricks  
  
Verse 1 (Gucci Mane)  
So icy C. E. O, I'm a fool with the snow  
They think I'm puttin' V. V. S jewels in the coke  
My watch a cool hundred, Paintjob a cold 20  
And after this flip I'm quittin' the trap cold turkey, Sike!  
The pack in and I'm workin'  
Drought season in, charged ya ass a whole 30  
But right now you can get it for a low number  
The fish scale white, Same color my hummer  
Zone 6 polar bears never see summer  
It's winter all year cause the birds fly under  
95' Air Max cause I'm a dope runna'  
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper I'ts Gucci  
  
Chorus (Gucci Mane)

Verse 2 (Young Ralph)  
I'm like a waitress in the trap I got somethin' to serve  
That's 16 bars, Same price for a bird  
What you need a bird?  
Or a couple pounds?  
I'm on Cleveland Ave, You know my side of town  
So many bricks I can build my own apartment  
Ya better a check, When ya come in my department  
Yes I break em' down  
And I sell em' whole, Try me watch ya whole crew fall like some dominoes  
I got a trap house  
And a trap car  
100, 00 off a cap, That's a trap star  
All this smoke got me feelin' real nauseous  
Ridin' with them bricks got me feelin' real cautious  
  
Chorus (Gucci Mane)

Verse 3 (Yo Gotti)  
Tony Montana, All I have in this world  
Is my 100 round chopper and my white girl  
Oil base bricks, shit hard to cook  
Call the plug back, Tell him he got took  
Know what that mean? The shit free  
That mean none for him, And more for me  
I took somethin', I'm gutta bitch  
Don't trust me dog, This that North Memphis shit  
Old school, New Porsche  
Couple choppas just in case they wanna go to war bricks  
A. K. A my best friend  
28 inch rims call em' grown men  
Dope stepped on, Call it step child  
I got that Slim Shady, We call it 8 Mile  
I'm from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown  
Gotti Street, And nigga that's my brick house  
  
Chorus (Gucci Mane)
