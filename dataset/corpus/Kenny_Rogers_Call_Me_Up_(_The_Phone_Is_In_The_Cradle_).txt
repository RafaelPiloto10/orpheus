My friends, they don't talk much about religion  
But my friends, they don't talk much anyway-ay  
When they do I know I'd better listen  
'Cause my good friends just naturally know  
The right things to say  
  
They say, call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my door-oor  
Well if you're so inclined and if you've got the time  
We can talk the night away  
  
Adam got so lonely in the garden  
He said it's tough to be the only man alive  
He said I'd give a rib for just somebody to talk to  
Well thunder and lightnin' out providin'  
You came strollin' by  
  
She said, call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doo-oor  
Well if you're so inclined and if you've got the time  
We can talk the night away  
  
Now Rosie was the queen of the all night cowboy  
She said, Texas boy, you seem kinda shy-why  
Don't you expect an embossed invitation  
Just knock on the wall, come down the hall  
And knock on by  
  
She said, call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doo-oor  
Call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doo-oor  
Call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doo-oor  
Call me up, the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself
