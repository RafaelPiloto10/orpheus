Can't you see your love is all I need,  
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.  
  
Baby, I think you should take the time alone,  
To sort out your feelings and be sure you're not going wrong, no.  
You see, I know you hear many things that make you cry,  
But our love is too strong to be ruined by a lie.  
Can't you see your love is all I need,  
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.  
  
Now tell me how I could ever live without you,  
I can't live without you,  
If you left me now I don't know what I would do.  
I've never known anyone who could love me like you do,  
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you.  
  
Can't you see your love is all I need,  
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.  
  
I've never known anyone who could love me like you do,  
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you.  
  
Can't you see your love is all I need,  
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.  
Can't you see your love is all I need,  
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.  
  
No I just can't live without you,  
Can't live without your love,  
So baby please don't leave.  
You should take some time to realise,  
You're the only one I'm thinking of.  
Baby please don't leave,  
Thought our love was too strong to fall,  
I need you baby so please don't go.
