When she looks at me  
I know the girl sees things  
Nobody else can see  
  
All of the secret fears inside  
And all the craziness I hide  
She looks into my soul  
And reads me like nobody can  
  
And she doesn't judge the man  
She just takes me as I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Come what may, she believes  
And that faith is something  
I've never known before  
Come what may, she loves me  
And that love has helped me open a door  
Making me love myself a little more  
  
When I turn away  
She knows those are the times  
There's nothing she can say  
  
Nothing that anyone can do  
And so she lets me live it through  
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty  
She just simply lets me be  
And goes right on loving me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
And when it seems my dreams  
Have all slipped through my fingers  
When they just can't be found  
I turn around and there they are  
Shining in her eyes
