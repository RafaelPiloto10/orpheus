You've got no reason  
To say you're all alone  
There will be a change of season  
That'll win a heart of stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is just around the corner  
And standing out of view  
Love is just around the corner  
For you  
  
I can see a smile tomorrow  
A reason to go on  
'Cause the sky is always darkest  
Before the new day dawns  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't ever stop believing  
The sun is going to shine  
'Cause it's worth giving and receiving  
If you only give it time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't think you've found salvation  
Or that the day is won  
When you reach your destination  
The journey's just begun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is just around the corner  
For you  
For you
