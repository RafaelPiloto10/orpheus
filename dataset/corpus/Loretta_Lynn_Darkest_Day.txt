Darlin' when you told me you were leavin' I thought that you were only foolin'
me  
But here I am to face old blue tomorrow with a broken heart that's filled with
misery  
It seems that my world is through an end  
Just dreamin' of things that might have been

Oh how I wish that old scene is through it's always darkest just before dawn  
Then I'll know soon I'm gonna see the sunshine  
I just can't take this darkness on and on  
It seems that my world is...
