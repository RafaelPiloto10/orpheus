It seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe  
He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow  
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by  
  
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare  
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere  
Troubles fly away and life is easy go  
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know  
  
Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe  
  
Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe
