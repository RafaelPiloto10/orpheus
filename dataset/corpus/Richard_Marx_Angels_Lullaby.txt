I was never alive  
'Til the day I was blessed with you  
When I hold you late at night  
I know what I was put here to do  
I turn off the world and listen to you sigh  
And I will sing my Angel's Lullaby  
  
Know I'm forever near  
The one you can always call  
Right all you know to fear  
Are the shadows on your wall  
I'm here close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
And I will sing my Angel's Lullaby  
  
So tell me how to stop the years from racing  
Is there a secret someone knows?  
I'll never catch all the memories I'm chasing  
I'll never be ready to let go  
  
And when the world seems cold  
And you feel that all of your strength is gone  
There may be one tiny voice  
Your reason to carry on  
And when I'm not close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
You will sing your Angel's Lullaby  
Let this be our Angel's Lullaby
