The room was filled with talk  
For anyone listening  
I found a spot by the door  
With no one around  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune  
I kept a smile on my face  
For anyone looking  
Tried to turn away questions  
Before he asked  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune  
I was engrossed in the film  
Without really watching  
Said, "who's the guy with the gun?"  
As if I was involved  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune
