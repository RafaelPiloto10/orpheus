I do it for your love  
I'm not sentimental, no one calls me tender  
I keep my emotions safe inside  
But I've never felt these feelings  
And time just keeps revealing  
A part of me I can no longer hide  
The moment that I kissed your lips  
I found a whole new world exists  
Look what you've done with my life.  
If I write your name a thousand times  
Inside a heart next to mine  
Act like a fool whose faith is blind  
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.  
I'm not one for flowers  
Or talking on the phone for hours  
Fancy words have never been my game  
An answered prayer I never prayed  
That came true anyway  
Now I know I'll never be the same.  
If I light a candle in the night  
To see the reflection in your eyes  
You don't even need to ask me why  
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.  
I write your name
