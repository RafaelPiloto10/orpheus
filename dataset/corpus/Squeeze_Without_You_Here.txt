I feel so empty  
As the plane takes off  
I see the ground below  
I know that one day  
It won't be long  
That you will also know  
Just how it feels  
To leave you now, a hollow shell  
A broken bow  
I feel so empty high up in the air  
Where heaven's meant to be  
The distance gets me  
When I'm on my own  
Without you here with me  
  
My world is turning  
But it's upside down  
Now you're so far away  
While you are learning  
How this world spins round  
I'm in some other day  
What can i do  
But give my heart  
From far away  
A distant spark  
  
I feel a challenge  
For both you and i  
That's how it has to be  
In life there's balance  
I hope time will fly  
Without you here with me  
  
What i am hoping for  
As life moves on  
And we reach finer years  
We won't be thinking  
Of the time that's gone  
Or wading through our tears  
We'll smile as one  
And speak with pride  
How life has swung  
Back on our side  
  
I feel tomorrow  
Can't come by too soon  
To bring you back to see  
That love will follow  
Like the red balloon  
And you'll come home to me  
I want you here with me
