Intro:  
Let's get down to business  
I don't got no time to play around what is this... what is this...  
The Invasion! yeah yeah Green Lantern! The infiltration! We're comin'!  
Yeah!  
I got 50 Cent, I got G-unit, D-twizzy in this bitch, wit' obie trice  
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name, 'cause you say one more thing,
it won't be nice  
Here we go,  
I shoulda known  
I was bound to get pulled  
Into some bullshit  
Sooner or later  
You litte haters  
Are too jealous of us to love us  
You hate it,  
G-unit made it,  
Then Obie's coming,  
D-twizzy's comin, ya sick to  
Ya stomach  
50 percent of it's 50 Cent,  
The other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is  
But if you even considerin' takin' our label down,  
You better find our building  
And fly a fuckin plane into it  
But I ain't tryin to get to intricate into it,  
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit  
'cause then it's gonna get to the point  
Where it escalates into some other shit,  
Then I'm a flip  
Then I'm a get to  
Stompin' in my Air Force once,  
Won't be able to tell if its two purrs or it's one  
'cause it's gone feel like so many feet kickin you,  
You think Nike just made these cleats into shoes  
I don't know what it is or what it could be,  
But I get a woody,  
When these pussies try to push me  
Thinkin they gone put me in a position to pickle me  
Y'all tickle me pink,  
I think I'd just rather have pink tickle me  
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety,  
A little bit of the diggety doc  
Diggety mixed with a little bit of the jigga j-jigga  
What a small pinch,  
Biggy look at me,  
I'm just a bomb diggety  
(Chorus)  
We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable  
'cause we gone fuck around and kill your lable! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50,
Shady  
Records we the lable for sho!  
We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable  
'cause we gone fuck around and steal your paper! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50,
we're  
Gone kill your fuckin lable for sho!  
(Bridge)  
Shady in the place to BC, 'cause I got what it takes to rock tha mic RIGHT!  
Still watch what you say to me ho cause I'm off probation in less than 6
MONTHS!  
(Outro)  
Ha ha, whooo, Shady records, still Aftermath, and don't think we don't hear
you  
Muthafuckas talkin, 'cause we do, we see y'all, but we just gone sit back for
a minute  
And see what the fuck y'all do!
