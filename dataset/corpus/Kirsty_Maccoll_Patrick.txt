He was a stranger in london at night  
And he felt alone so he followed a light  
Into a bar where the music was loud  
He ordered a pint and got lost in the crowd  
He asked a girl if she wanted to dance  
She turned up her nose and she told him "no chance!"  
He felt rejected and stood by the wall  
And wondered why he'd ever bothered at all  
He missed his family and wished he was home  
With all of those strangers he felt so alone  
Patrick don't be afraid  
You'll live to laugh another day  
Patrick don't be afraid  
The cavalry is on the way  
He stood in silence, looked round for a while  
Then he saw a girl and she looked back and smiled  
Then he went over and started to talk  
She looked a bit like his sister in cork  
He bought her a drink with his last two quid  
When he said "come back for a coffee" she did  
Patrick you've got it made  
You're halfway there, you're on your way  
Patrick she's not afraid  
And now I bet you're glad you stayed  
Looking so lovely and perfectly groomed  
She showed in the centre of patrick's room  
She was lit up from the inside and out  
Oh he was enchanted as she moved about  
She touched him like sunlight on cold mountain stone  
And he grew afraid lest she leave him alone  
Patrick don't be afraid  
You've won the girl and saved the day  
Patrick you've got it made  
The girl's not going to run away  
Patrick don't be afraid  
The cavalry is on the way  
Patrick you've got it made  
Just look outside it's a lovely day
