His friends are more than fond of Robin  
He doesn't need to compliment them  
And always as he leaves he leaves them  
Feeling proud just to know him  
  
When Robin goes on holiday  
There's no-one livin' in our lane  
Oh yes, folks still live in our lane  
But they're not like Robin  
  
Robin, I've never told you  
But I'll be yours until we're old  
Please learn to call me in your dreams  
The way I'm lookin' at you is just as it seems  
  
He's talked about before he gets there  
Though he can never understand it  
And I wouldn't like to be his alone  
But I'm shy and can't demand it  
  
But when Robin gives his love to others  
There's no-one living in my heart  
Oh yes, I keep others in my heart  
But they're not like Robin
