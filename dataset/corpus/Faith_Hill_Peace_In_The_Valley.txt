Oh, well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go alone  
Till the Lord comes and calls me, calls me away, oh yes  
Well the morning's so bright and the lamp is alight  
And the night is black as the sea, oh yes  
  
There will be peace in the valley for me someday  
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray  
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see  
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh yes  
  
Listen, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tamed  
And the lion shall lay down by the Lamb, oh yes  
And the beast from the wild shall be led by a child  
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature I am, I am  
  
There will be peace in the valley for me someday  
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray  
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see  
'Cause there will be peace in the valley for me, one more time  
There will be peace in the valley for me
