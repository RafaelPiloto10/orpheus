Charming, someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Something to charm  
Danger, someone to harm  
Falling into the mire  
Climbing, higher and higher  
  
Someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Ivory tower  
Longing for something now  
Waiting, hour after hour  
Give me some of your power  
  
Citadel, a prison of sorts  
Only the rich make the laws  
Using repression and force  
Whore of Babylon, City of Quartz  
  
Someone to fear  
Hidden and very much here  
Hatred summoned so near  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear
