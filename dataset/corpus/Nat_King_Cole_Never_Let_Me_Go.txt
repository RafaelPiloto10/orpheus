Never let me go  
Love me much too much  
If you let me go  
Life will lose its touch  
What would I be without you?  
There's no place for me without you  
  
Never let me go  
I'd be so lost if you went away  
There'd be a thousand hours in a day without you  
I know  
  
Because of one caress my world was overturned  
at the very start  
All my bridges burned by my flaming heart  
You'd never leave me would you?  
You couldn't hurt me could you?  
  
Never let me go  
Never let me go
