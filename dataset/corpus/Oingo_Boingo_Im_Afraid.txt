Afraid of the dark  
Afraid of the light  
Don't walk in the park  
Afraid of the night  
Afraid to get stabbed  
Or hit by a car  
Afraid of the streets  
Afraid to go far  
Afraid of the sky  
Don't like to be high  
I don't want to fall  
Afraid I might die  
Afraid of my friends  
Don't like to be seen  
Afraid to be nice  
Afraid to be mean  
Afraid that the wind  
Will knock over trees  
Afraid of my dog  
Afraid of his fleas  
  
[Chorus:]  
Peace of mind  
Hard to keep  
Hard to find  
Look ahead  
Look behind  
Looking for  
Peace of mind  
Can't relax  
Can't unwind  
Deep inside  
Secret mind  
Oh no!  
  
Afraid to be caught  
Afraid to be free  
Afraid to make love  
Afraid of vd  
Afraid of the rain  
Don't like to get wet  
Afraid to take drugs  
They make me forget  
Afraid that the air  
Will make me get sick  
Afraid that a girl  
Will cut off my.... Oh!  
  
Someone tell me how it happened  
Why my head is so confused  
Can it be my circuits finally blew a fuse  
Can a human being really change into a humanoid  
Or is my imagination paranoid  
All I need is peace and quiet, maybe just a little time  
Turn the channel, turn the channel piece of mind  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
Afraid of success  
Afraid to grow old  
Afraid that my brain  
Is covered with mold  
Afraid that I might  
Ce put on a shelf  
But that's not the least, oh, oh!  
Afraid of myself
