[Chorus:]  
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas  
Mommy and Daddy are mad  
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas  
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad  
  
I broke my bat on Johnny's head  
Somebody snitched on me  
I hid a frog in sister's bed  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
I spilled some ink on Mommy's bed  
I made Tommy eat a bug  
Bought some gum with a penny slug  
Somebody snitched on me, oh  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
I put a tack on teacher's chair  
Somebody snitched on me  
I tied a knot in Susie's hair  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
I did a dance on Mommy's plants  
Climbed a tree and tore my pants  
Filled that sugar bowl with ants  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
So you better be good, whatever you do  
'Cause if you're bad, I'm warning you  
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas
