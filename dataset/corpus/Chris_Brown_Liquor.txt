[Verse 1]  
There's something in this liquor, the air is getting thicker  
I can't help but to stare at you, oh yeah, girl what did you do to me?  
What did you slip up in my cup, girl? Cause I want you, oh yeah  
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here  
  
[Chorus]  
There's something in this liquor, oh yeah  
The air is getting thicker  
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou  
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's something in this liquor girl, I'm looking at your figure woah  
I just want to see you strip right now, baby let me help you work it out, oh  
Girl you look so good, I just wanna get right to it, oh  
I could beat it up like-like a real nigga should, baby when we do it, woah  
  
[Chorus]  
There's something in this liquor, oh yeah  
The air is getting thicker  
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou  
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck  
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck  
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou, drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck  
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck  
  
[Bridge]  
There's something in this liquor, there's something in this liquor girl  
The air is getting thicker, I can't help but stare at you, oh yeah, girl what
did you do?  
What did you slip up in my cup girl? Cause I want some  
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here, woah  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck  
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck  
Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck  
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck  
  
[Outro]  
All I wanna do is drink and, drink, drink and  
Drink and, and, and  
Drink and, drink, drink and  
Drink and, and, and
