It's either black or white that's right  
We're making love or in a fight  
Sometimes you make me so blue  
  
But then it feels so good I knew it would  
You know the way to make me crazy  
I want to give it to you  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional  
  
You take me high and low you know  
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go  
You're such a mystery to me  
  
But baby hot or cold, you got a hold  
Of my imagination  
I think you know what i mean  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional  
  
Rain is falling down on me  
Suddenly the sun comes out  
Sometimes north or south of love  
But never out.
