VERSE 1:  
Yeah I ain't consistent, some collar crime  
I won't call you regular, no, I'll wait till I'm blind  
Yeah until I'm blind  
I think of you off and on, you sure you can't hear  
Each message I send ya, oh so silent and clear?  
But this coin says I luv ya  
And see ya on the other side  
  
CHORUS:  
I've been up all night with a head full of neon  
I've been up all night with a head full of neon  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
  
VERSE 2:  
You drink to remember, yeah, you drink to forget  
Just like writing songs, like a letter never sent  
Yeah and I never sent em on  
But it's a shout in the backyard, a punch in the sky  
A love unconditional to straighten my spine  
But this coin says I luv ya  
And don't wait 'til the other side  
  
CHORUS:  
I've been up all night with a head full of neon  
Just give me deliverance and an old friend to lean on  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
  
BRIDGE:  
I'm sorry sorry sorry sorry, for  
I'll make it back again  
But this affliction ain't temporary  
It's where I began  
Yeah, yeah but I save my skin  
So hit that old four-and-a-half chord, oh oh, shit again  
  
VERSE 3:  
I've been treating my friends just like holds or keys  
You don't know you need them, oh yeah, till you're down on your knees  
And I'm down here on my knees  
  
CHORUS:  
Cause I've been up all night with a head full of neon  
Yeah give me deliverance and an old friend to lean on  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhhhhh  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
Hey yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
