Riding on this great big star  
We've got to stand up if we're gonna be free yeah  
  
If you want it you got to believe  
Believe in yourself

We just want to be loved  
  
The Son of God is in your face  
Offering us eternal grace  
If you want it you've got to believe  
'Cause being free is just a state of mind  
  
We'll one day leave this all behind  
Just put your faith in God  
And one day you'll see it  
If you want it you got it  
  
You just got to believe  
Believe in yourself  
'Cause it's all just a game  
We just want to be loved
