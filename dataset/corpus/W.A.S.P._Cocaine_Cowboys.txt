Oh gotta go, cowboys and blow  
High in the saddle again  
Hell or high water, I'll do what I wanna  
On my horse and I'm on my way  
Do some toots, pull on my boots  
Oh, I gonna ride away  
High on the plains, high on the reigns  
White lightning lines I'll be  
Riding high, oh so high  
  
Oh gotta yell, cowboys from hell  
Oh I'm in a Devil's haze  
I'm on the trail and I'm riding the rails  
Oh I'm getting blown away  
I do the juice, I'm Eastwood and the Duke  
Oh I'm gonna ride the range  
High on the plains, high on the reigns  
White lightning lines I'll be  
Riding high, oh so high  
  
I'm gonna ride  
Cocaine cowboys  
I'll be riding high tonight  
Cocaine cowboys never die  
  
Ride  
Ride 'em cowboys  
High in the saddle every night  
Cocaine cowboys gotta ride
