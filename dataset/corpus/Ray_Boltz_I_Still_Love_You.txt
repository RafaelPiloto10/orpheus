I Still Love You  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
There's a fire in my heart tonight  
I feel it in my soul  
It's getting brighter every day  
Lord, you came into my life  
A long time ago  
And here I am tonight  
I've just got to say  
Chorus:  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I'm here to praise Your name  
Some days I must confess  
The feelings aren't the same  
My heart just feels so very cold  
But Your hand of love and mercy  
Keeps me pressing on  
And even when I don't feel it  
Deep inside I know  
Chorus  
This world is full of promises  
None of them are true  
But Your word  
Will never pass away  
I want to follow You  
Chorus  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
To praise Your name  
I still love You
