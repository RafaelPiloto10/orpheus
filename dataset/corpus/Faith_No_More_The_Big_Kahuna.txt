What's it to you?  
Let's make it new  
Let's make it die, make it die  
There's nothing wrong  
It's lived to long  
And the plesure is yours and mine  
  
You conceived me now you wanna kill me  
It won't be easy, hey I wanna be me  
You took me with you, now I'm gonna kill you  
I want my mom!!!  
  
What's it to you?  
  
What's it to you?  
Cutting through you  
It's still alive, still alive  
This thing between us  
????(audio clip of entire verse)  
And it's chewing from the inside
