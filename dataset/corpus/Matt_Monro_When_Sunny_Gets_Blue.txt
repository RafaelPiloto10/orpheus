When sunny gets blue  
Skies get grey and cloudy  
And the rain begins to fall  
Pitter patter, pitter patter  
Love is gone  
So what can I do  
No sweet lover man comes to call  
Oh when sunny gets blue  
Oh when sunny gets blue  
She breathes a sigh of sadness  
Like the winds that sway the trees.  
Winds that set the leaves a-sway  
Like the violins that play  
Strange and haunting melodies  
Oh when sunny gets blue  
Sunny gets blue  
When sunny gets blue  
  
People used to love to see her laugh  
And see her smile  
That's how she got her name  
Since that sad affair  
She's lost her smile  
Changed her style  
Somehow she's not the same  
The memories come back  
And pretty dreams rise up  
Where the other dreams fell through  
Hurry new love, hurry here  
Kiss away each lonely tear  
Hold me near when  
Sunny gets blue  
Oh yes, when sunny gets blue  
Sunny gets blue  
When sunny gets blue  
Sunny gets blue
