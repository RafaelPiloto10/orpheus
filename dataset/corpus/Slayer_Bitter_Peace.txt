Initiate blood purge  
Coalition in massacre  
Mechanized high tech  
Whole sale death in effect  
  
Mutually assured  
Destruction will occur  
Genocide revised  
Same pain through diverse eyes  
  
Can't stop the warring factions  
Hostile from the start  
Always war always  
Ending bitter peace  
  
Not the last third war  
Blood spills for evermore  
Patriot hard line  
Lay siege till the end of time  
  
No longer kill your brother  
Just slaughter one another  
Watch for the deadly other  
This sibling is a fucker  
  
Can't stop the warring factions  
  
Global tension starts aggression  
Peace breaks out then  
Breeds contempt unrest  
  
Without a reason to fight  
A time to kill  
Sick lust for skeletal flesh  
A taste for all decay  
  
Enter the solider blind  
Stalking the faceless hunt  
There is no conscience in this world  
That can be reached for peace  
  
Why face the human question  
The need to hate  
Dead stare though cynical eyes  
A trust in only pain  
  
Murder within the skin  
Engrave the art of war  
Become death's vile parade  
March on embrace the violent mind  
  
Can't stop the warring factions  
  
Global tension starts aggression  
Peace breaks out then  
Breeds contempt unrest  
One cryptic reason for life murder
