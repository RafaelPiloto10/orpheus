If I had no place to fall  
And I needed to  
Could I count on you  
To lay me down?  
  
I'd never tell you no lies  
I don't believe it's wise  
You got pretty eyes  
Won't you spin me 'round  
  
I ain't much of a lover it's true  
I'm here then I'm gone  
And I'm forever blue  
But I'm sure wanting you  
  
Skies full of silver and gold  
Try to hide the sun  
But it can't be done  
Least not for long  
  
And if we help each other grow  
While the light of day  
Smiles down our way  
Then we can't go wrong  
  
Time, she's a fast old train  
She's here then she's gone  
And she won't come again  
Won't you take my hand  
  
If I had no place to fall  
And I needed to  
Could I count on you  
To lay me down?
