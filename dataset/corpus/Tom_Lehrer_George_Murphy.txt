During the last election we had a good deal of fun back east following your
senatorial contest out here. I'm from Massachusetts, and I feel that we have a
certain right to gloat over the other states because Massachusetts is after
all the only state with three senators. Anyway, here's a salute to your new
junior senator:  
  
Hollywood's often tried to mix  
Show business with politics  
From Helen Gahagan  
To Ronald Reagan?  
But Mr. Murphy is the star  
Who's done the best by far.  
  
Oh, gee, it's great!  
At last we've got a senator who can really sing and dance.  
We can't expect America to win against its foes  
With no one in the Senate who can really tap his toes.  
  
The movies that you've seen  
On your television screen  
Show his legislative talents at a glance.  
Should Americans pick crops? George says "No,  
'cause no one but a Mexican would stoop so low."  
And after all, even in Egypt, the pharaohs  
Had to import Hebrew braceros.  
  
Think of all the musicals we have in store.  
Imagine: "Broadway Melody of Nineteen Eighty-Four."  
Yes, now that he's a Senator, he's really got the chance  
To give the public a song and dance!
