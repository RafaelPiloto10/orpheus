Looking down on a junior cowboy  
I see myself at the end of each day  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Took loopy loo to a paper hat party  
And fought the kid who tried to take her away  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Running away,you don't know,you don't care  
Funny the way that we change  
Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard  
With no thought for the rest of the day  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
'cause my rumble tumble days are over now
