[Billy]: Yes, I will go back to school  
And achieve victory!  
No man will take what my father has built  
Unless that man is me!  
  
[Veronica]: My Billy, sweet Billy boy  
I knew you would go back  
No one can stop you if you try  
Don't I have a nice rack?  
  
[Billy]: Veronica, I thank you  
For beating the shit out of me  
I see things so clearly now  
I choose my destiny  
  
[veronica]: Oh Billy, I knew you had it in ya'  
  
[Kids]: We're here to help you Billy  
Get back in school to stay  
You gotta' work real hard  
And stick it out  
Till graduation day!  
  
[Clown]: Hey, Kids! It's me  
I bet you thought that I was dead  
But when I fell over I just broke my leg  
And got a hemorrhage in my head [ha ha ha]  
  
[All]: There are obstacles in the way  
[Maid]: In the way  
[All again]: But together we shall overcome  
[Maid]: Overcome  
But you can't break a spirit  
And you can't heal a dream  
[Maid]: Dream  
Do you have anymore gum?  
More gum, more gum, more gum  
[Billy]: Do you have anymore gum?
