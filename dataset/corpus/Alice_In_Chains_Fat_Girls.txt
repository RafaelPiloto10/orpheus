"Harry! Take the garbage out!"  
"Yes, poopsie."  
  
(Fat girls)  
Ooo, can be so much fun  
Their mouths are motors  
(What a girl)  
So let their motors run!  
  
After they have eaten you  
Out of house and home  
Strip down to your birthday suit  
And let them (halves?) explode!  
  
Can't to back in their cake too much  
With only goes out for an occasional where to put!  
Can't to back in their cake too much  
Ooo, they're never gonna stop!  
  
(What a girl)  
Fat girls  
(Yum)  
(What a girl) Woo  
Fat girls can be so much fun!  
  
When you're done and satisfied  
You must throw them out  
Never have to say, for sure  
(Gross?) them out  
  
Feeding my special ladies  
Have but one thing to gain  
They want to have your babies  
They want you ball and chain  
  
They clean to back and they clean too much  
With only goes out for an occasional where to put! (?)  
They clean to back and they clean too much  
Ooo, they're never gonna stop!  
  
(What a girl)  
Fat girls  
(Yum)  
(What a girl) Woo  
Fat girls, Oooouhhh  
  
OoooOh!
