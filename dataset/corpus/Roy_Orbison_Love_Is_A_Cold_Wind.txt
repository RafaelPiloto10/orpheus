Love is a cold wind  
When it blows away from you  
As you watch it go, it hurts to know  
There's nothing you can do  
You're all alone again  
And love is a cold wind  
Love is a rain storm  
But it only rains on you  
And there's no one there who seems to care  
No one to pull you through  
And inside you're never warm  
'Cause love is a rain storm  
But when she was here  
Love was a breezy morning  
Filled with the sun  
Warm as her smile  
But now it's done  
Love is a cold wind as it blows away from  
So you find your way, to yesterday  
What else is there to do  
You're all alone again and love is a cold wind  
But when she was here  
Love was abreezy morning  
Filled with the sun  
Warm as her smile  
But now it's done  
Love is a cold wind  
As it blows away from you  
As you watch it go  
It hurts to know  
There's nothing you can do  
And you're all alone again and love is a cold wind  
You're all alone again and love is a cold wind.
