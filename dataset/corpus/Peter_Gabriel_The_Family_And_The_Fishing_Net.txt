Suffocated by mirrors, stained by dreams  
Her honey belly pulls the seams  
Curves are still upon the hinge  
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin  
  
Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night  
The sponge is full, well out of sight  
All around the conversations  
Icing on the warm flesh cake  
  
Light creeps through her secret tunnels  
Sucked into the open spaces  
Burning out in sudden flashes  
Draining blood from well-fed faces  
  
Desires form in subtle whispers  
Flex the muscles in denial  
Up and down its pristine cage  
So the music, so the trial  
  
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens  
Dance in circles, they the blessed  
Man and wife, undressed by all  
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed  
  
Even as the soft skins tingle  
They mingle with the homeless mother  
Who loves the day but lives another  
That once was hers  
  
The worried father, long lost lover  
Brushes ashes with his broom  
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover  
Bursting over the bride and groom  
  
And the talk goes on  
  
Memories crash on tireless waves  
The lifeguards whom the winter saves  
  
Silence falls the guillotine  
All the doors are shut  
Nervous hands grip tight the knife  
In the darkness, till the cake is cut  
  
Passed around, in little pieces  
The body and the flesh  
The family and the fishing-net  
And another in the mesh  
  
The body and the flesh
