Please tell me what is taking place,  
Cause I can't seem to find a trace.  
Guess it must have got away somehow.  
Probably 'cause I always forget, everytime someone  
Tells me their name.  
It's always gotta' be the same  
  
In my world  
  
Never wore a cover up,  
Always beat the boys up.  
Grew up in a 5, 000 population town  
Made my money by cutting grass,  
Got fired by fried chicken ass  
All in a small town, Napanee.  
  
You know, I always stay up,  
Without sleeping, and think to myself.  
Where do I belong forever,  
In whose arms, the time and place?  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world  
  
I never spend less than an hour,  
Washing my hair in the shower.  
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight.  
So I braid in a zillion braids,  
Though it may take a friggin' day,  
There's nothing else better to do anyway.  
  
When you're all alone,  
In the lands of forever,  
Lay under the milky way.  
On and on, it's getting to late out,  
I'm not in love this time, this night.  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world.  
  
(La, La, La, La)  
  
Take sometime,  
Mellow out.  
Party up,  
But don't fall down.  
Don't get caught,  
Sneak out of the house.  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world  
  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world.
