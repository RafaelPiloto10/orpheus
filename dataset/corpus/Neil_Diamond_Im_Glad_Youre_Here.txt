We'll there's no need explaining  
It doesn't really matter anyway  
So you let the rain in  
And being sorry's not enough to say  
And though you'll never make it right  
I'm glad you're here with me tonight  
  
Hey babe, the sunshine's on you  
Even though the skies are dark and gray  
Well, if I have to miss you  
I'd just as soon begin some other day  
And though you'll never make it right  
I'm glad you're here with me tonight  
  
Out there in the storm  
Not everyone is safe and warm  
  
Now the leaves are falling  
I guess they didn't have much more to say  
And with the winter calling  
It's gonna be a long and lonely day  
And though you'll never make it right  
I'm glad you're here with me tonight  
  
Cause out there in the storm  
Not everyone is safe and warm  
Oh, no  
  
And if we never make it right  
I'm glad you're here with me tonight  
If we never make it right  
I'm glad you're here with me tonight  
So glad to have you, babe (stay right here tonight)  
So glad baby (oh, no)  
(feels like old times)
