Right, let's get the whole thing cooking)  
  
I try to run in a different race  
But every time I seem to loose face  
Making it hard it's easy  
But I got to keep trying to lessen my pace  
  
I try to walk down a city-street  
I say hello to the people I meet  
They're walking their way and thinking I'm crazy  
But I have so much trouble just to keeping the beat  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
'Cause I just do what I please  
Whatever I was blessing  
Well it worn't to laugh at me  
  
Maybe I'm just a country boy  
Hinging life bringing no joy  
Well it's bringing me down, it's making me lonely  
You see I'm fooling with a life and it ain't no toy  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
'Cause I just do what I please  
And whenever I got problems  
I just call upon Aries  
  
Here she comes  
Here she comes
