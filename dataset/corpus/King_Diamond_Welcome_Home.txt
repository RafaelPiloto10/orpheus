Grandma' welcome home  
You have  
Been gone for far too long  
Is this a dream, are You really back?  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
Let me touch You, let me feel  
  
Grandma' take a look  
What do You think of the house and  
The silvery moon?  
We are going to repaint the front door  
Soon  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
Let me touch You, let me feel  
  
Wait till You see Your room up in the  
Attic  
Prepared just like You said, without a  
Bed  
You will find Your rocking chair and  
The tea pot that Missy found  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
There is someone waiting for You,  
Now come along  
  
Missy and Mother, they are dying to  
Meet You  
How strange, she's spoken no word  
I wonder Grandma!  
Are You all right?  
  
Grandma' what was it like to be on  
That holiday site  
"Oh it could have been worse but  
With "them" by my side  
In the twilight "they" sang all the old  
Lullabies"  
Grandma' who are "they"  
"Never mind You dirty little brat"  
  
"Let us go inside, something's on  
"Their" mind  
"They" are still alive, can You feel  
"Their" eyes  
Can You feel "their" eyes?  
Now that You are stuck with me You  
Better be my friend.
