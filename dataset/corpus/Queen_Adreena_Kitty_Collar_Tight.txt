Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
I hold your history  
And I kiss the map  
I'm looking back forwards  
Your tap drips, i... Catch  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Your skin, my nails  
Your mirror, my face  
Your skin impaled  
For your scars are my grace  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Watch how I put it on  
Kitty collar tight!  
Make it sing it's song  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!  
Make it fight  
Make it fight, fight!
