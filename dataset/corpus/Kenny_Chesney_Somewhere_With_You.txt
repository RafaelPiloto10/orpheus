If you're going out with someone new  
I'm going out with someone too  
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk  
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three a.m.  
You're fighting with your mom again  
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you  
  
I won't sit outside your house  
And wait for the lights to go out  
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed  
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you  
  
Like we did on the beach last summer  
When the rain came down and we took cover  
Down in your car, out by the pier  
You laid me down, whispered in my ear  
  
"I hate my life, hold on to me  
Ah, if you ever decide to leave  
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go."  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes  
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you  
  
If you see me out on the town  
And it looks like I'm burning it down  
You won't ask and I won't say  
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three a.m.  
You're fighting with your mom again  
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes  
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you  
  
Somewhere with you  
I'm somewhere with you  
I'm somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you
