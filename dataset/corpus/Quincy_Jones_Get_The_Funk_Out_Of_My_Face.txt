Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
  
You don't like my music  
You don't have to use it  
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release  
You don't have to get it  
All you do is let it  
Then you'll know exactly how to groove  
  
You don't like my music  
You don't have to use it  
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release  
  
You don't have to play it  
You don't have to say it  
You don't even have to try to sing it  
  
Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
Get the funk out ma face  
  
You don't like my music  
You don't have to use it  
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release  
  
You don't have to get it  
All you do is let it  
Then tell us our funk did you some good
