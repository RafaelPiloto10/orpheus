Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock 'n' roll.  
Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul.  
There ain't no need for me to be a wallflower,  
'Cause now I'm living on blues power.  
  
I knew all the time but now I'm gonna let you know:  
I'm gonna keep on rocking, no matter if it's fast or slow.  
Ain't gonna stop until the twenty-fifth hour,  
'Cause now I'm living on blues power.  
  
Talking to you, now.  
The boogie's gonna pull me through.  
Keep on, keep on, keep on keeping on.  
Keep on keeping on, keep on keeping on.
