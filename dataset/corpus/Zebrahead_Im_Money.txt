'Cause I'm a user  
A schmoozer  
A big dollar loser  
But that don't matter 'cause my friends call me a bruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me  
  
'Cause I'm not funny  
Honey  
A big oaf-why dummy  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
  
Yo, get out get out  
The way of the money man  
Ladies know I'm dope so consider me contraband  
Fellas are just jealous 'cause they're ponies and I'm a mustang  
Don't try to hang 'cause I'm out with a big bang  
  
Get get down  
All the ladies want to be with me  
Get get down  
All the fellas compete with me  
Get get down  
And I know that I'm trippin'  
But I really don't care 'cause this is how I'm livin'  
  
All the ladies all the ladies want to know me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
All the fellas all the fellas want to be me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
Intimidated by me  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
'cause I'm money  
  
'cause I'm a user  
A schmoozer  
A big dollar loser  
But that don't matter 'cause I drive a land cruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me  
  
'cause I'm not funny  
Honey  
A big oaf-why dummy  
But that don't matter 'cause I know I play with money  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
(Slow down)  
  
I got a time bomb tick, tick, tickin'  
Just like Anthrax  
Boys want to battle so I got me a battle axe  
Climax, your girl screams my name when you have sex  
I should charge a sales tax  
  
Get get down  
All the ladies want to get with me  
Get get down  
All the fellas compete with me  
Get get down and I know that I'm trippin'  
But that don't matter 'cause this is how I'm stickin'  
  
All the ladies all the ladies want to know me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
All the fellas all the fellas want to be me  
They ignore  
Intimidated by me  
Intimidated by me  
  
Everybody look at me  
I'm pimp-ass money  
I know you wish to get with this tonight  
Everybody look at me  
Flier than Mr. T  
I know you wish to get with this tonight  
  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money
