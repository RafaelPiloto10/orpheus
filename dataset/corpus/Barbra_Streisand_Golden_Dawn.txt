One golden dawn  
One summer night  
With nothing left to say  
  
We let the dream begin  
It was carried on the wind  
And it wandered away  
  
One golden sky  
One spark of light  
Forever will remain  
  
And the song of the storm  
Brought us close, kept us warm  
All alone making love  
In the rain  
  
Gone is the world outside  
Home on the turning tide  
True love will find the sun  
And know the reason why  
  
You make me hunger for  
You whispered, "Mi amor"  
Over the ocean's roar  
And the night will become  
Our golden dawn  
  
Two hearts as one  
No tears to cry  
With you I have it all  
  
If love can never die  
I'm not afraid to fly  
But how far must I fall  
  
One silver song  
One lullaby  
For all the love we make  
  
It's the look in your eyes  
It's the moon on the rise  
It's the sound of the heart  
That you break  
  
Gone is the dark of night  
Call on the early glow  
Send down the birds of love  
That circle us below  
  
And still I will hunger for  
You whispering, "Mi amor"  
Over the ocean's roar  
And your arms reach for me  
  
And the shine on the sea  
And the night will become  
Our golden dawn
