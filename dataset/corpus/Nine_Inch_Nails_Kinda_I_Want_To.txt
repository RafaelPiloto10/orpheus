I can't shake this feeling from my head.  
There's a devil sleeping in my bed.  
Watching you from across the way.  
I cannot make this feeling go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know it's not the right thing.  
And I know it's not the good think.  
But kinda I want to.  
  
I'm not sure of what I should do.  
When every thought I'm thinking of is you.  
All of my excuses turn to lies.  
Maybe God will cover up his eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why does it have to be this way?  
Why does it have to be?  
Why does have to be this way?  
Kinda I want to.  
Maybe just for tonight.  
We can pretend it's alright.  
What's the price I pay.  
I don't care what they say.  
I want to.  
I want to (I'll take my chance tonight)
