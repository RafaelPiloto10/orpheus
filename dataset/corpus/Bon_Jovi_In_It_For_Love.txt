Are. Sambora  
  
Life is a road  
Forever winding where it leads us  
I don't know  
In it together  
For better or worse  
Searching for our pal of gold.  
Time  
Leaves a trail of broken hearts  
So many arrows just keep missing  
Their mark  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love, baby  
Yeah  
Well share in the laughter  
Share in the tears  
And the promises we keep  
Life can be crazy  
Love can be cruel  
But its always been a two way street  
You try  
And give it all you have to give  
So many people don't know how to forgive  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love, baby.  
Solo  
You try  
And give it all you have to give  
So many people don't know how to forgive  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love baby.  
When youre in it for love baby  
In it for love  
When youre in it for love baby  
When youre in it for love baby  
When youre in it for love baby  
In it for love.
