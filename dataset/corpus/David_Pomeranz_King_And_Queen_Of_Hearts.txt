We're the king and queen of hearts  
Hold me when the music starts  
All my dreams come true  
When I dance with you  
  
Promise me you're mine tonight  
I've been waitin' lyin' tonight  
While the lights are low  
I'll never let you go  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
You know it's not my imagination  
Or a part of the orchestration  
Love was here at the culmination  
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts  
  
Time will pass and tears will fall  
But someday we'll both recall  
Moments made of this  
Golden memories  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
In a once and future dream  
Where the dances never seem to start  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)
