Love Is A Never Ending War (D. Blackwell)  
Well I dozed off in the back of the bus  
To the groan of the Greyhounds throttle  
And I woke to crack of a paper sack  
And a cork poppin' from a bottle  
I tell you son the old man said  
It was hell in world war two  
As he rolled up his pant leg  
I saw the wood that filled his shoe  
The younger man who followed him in opened up his vest  
Showed the older soldier where he caught one in the chest  
Both of them had purple hearts for the hell that they've been through  
Well I don't have no purple heart mine's just black and blue  
Chorus:  
Oh love is a never ending war  
March me into action  
And we'll train for what's in store  
You win some and you lose some  
But I believe in what I'm fightin' for  
Oh love is a never ending war  
They where half-way through that bottle  
And they where gettin' high  
I never fought in those two wars  
But Lord my throat was dry  
So I showed them scars and stitches  
Inflicted by Maria  
But I didn't think that would give me a drink  
So I blamed it on Korea  
I parted my hair and I showed them where  
I got shrapnel from a grenade  
I just couldn't tell it was where Annabelle  
Put a glas of lemonade  
How that I've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet  
And I never forget that hot August night  
And the fingernails of Jeanet  
Chorus  
As I neared my destination I saw tears well in their eyes  
Partly from the drinkin' but mostly from my lies  
And they stood up to salute me  
As I stepped down from the bus  
And out of the open window they yelled  
Give her hell for us  
Chorus
