I thought you knew me by now  
Let the lights go on roaring  
Someone's hand on my shoulder  
Then whip past the turning point  
There's time for the taking  
  
[Chorus]  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
  
A face that goes slowly  
A signal close by me  
The landscapes are changing  
And some of us flipped a coin  
And shimmered away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You really were aching  
It's turning to twilight  
Moving over and under  
Then a couple of figures  
Shook their heads of the high lines  
  
[Chorus]
