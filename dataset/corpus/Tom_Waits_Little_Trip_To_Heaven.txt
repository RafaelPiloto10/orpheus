Little trip to heaven on the wings of your love  
Banana moon is shining in the sky  
I feel like I'm in heaven when your with me  
I know that I'm in heaven when you smile  
Though we're stuck here on the ground  
I got something that I've found, and it's you  
  
I don't have to take no trip to outer space  
All I have to do is look at your face  
And before I know it I'm in orbit around you  
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you  
When I see your constellation, honey your my inspiration  
And it's you  
  
Your my North Star when I'm lost and feeling blue  
Your my sun that's breaking through, don't you know it's true  
Honey all the other stars seem dim around you  
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you  
When I see your smiling face  
Honey I know nothing ever gonna take your place  
And it's you, and it's you, and it's you,  
And it's you, and it's you, and it's you
