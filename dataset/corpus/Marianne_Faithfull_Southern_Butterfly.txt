Where I walk  
And life is warm  
Sun and breath  
Hopefully here  
All our hearts are blessed.  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried,  
Here I tried  
To be the best.  
So hot it's white and real to me  
I'd stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried,  
Here I tried  
To be the best.  
So hot it's fine and real, real me  
I'd stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.
