Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
Love can take you by the hand  
Love can drop you where you stand  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
She can turn your head around  
He can lift you off the ground  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Love you make it what it is  
Life can change it with a kiss  
Love, love, love, love
