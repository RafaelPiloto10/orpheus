I believe for every drop of rain that falls  
A flower grows  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night  
A candle glows  
I believe for everyone that goes astray  
Someone will come to show the way  
I believe  
I believe  
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer  
Will still be heard  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere  
Hears every word  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf  
Or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf  
Or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
(Why I believe)
