Hoo  
Hoo  
  
I am the one for you.  
  
The possibilities are endless  
The number of things that you could do to me  
Baby you can drive me senseless  
Make me what you want me to be.  
'cause' you take me to the (take me) highest mountain (take me)  
Take me to (take me) the deep blue sea (take me)  
You can't get enough of my kind of love  
You're really doing something to me.  
  
I am the one for you  
Nothing that you or anybody else can do  
Hoo  
I am the one for you  
Am I getting through getting through to you?  
  
My mind's been working overtime  
Thinking of ways I'm gonna get to you  
Rain or shine you'll be mine  
And you know it'll be soon  
'cause' I'll give you (give you) love that (lovin') you never dreamed of  
I'll give you (give you) that and even more(lovin')  
Face up to the fact  
It's time to react  
You'll be giving like you never before.  
  
I am the one for you  
Nothing that you or anybody else can do  
Hoo  
I am the one for you
