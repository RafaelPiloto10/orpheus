It seems to me there's something serious beginning  
A new approach found to the meaning of life  
Deny that happiness is open as an option  
And disappointment disappears over night  
  
Say that love is an impossible dream  
Face the facts, that's what it's always been  
Relax, what you see is what you've seen  
What you get, is a new philosophy  
  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama  
With realism on the sparsest of sets  
Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion  
No happy endings but a message to depress  
Saying life is an impossible scheme  
That's the point of this philosophy  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
But if is wasn't, and isn't were  
You can't be sure, but you might find ecstasy  
  
(Oh no)  
  
Just for the sake of it, make sure you're always frowning  
(Get, get, get)  
It shows the world that you've got substance and depth  
You know, life is an impossible scheme  
And love an imperceptible dream  
  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserable
