Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year when the world falls in love  
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say "Merry Christmas,  
"May your New Year dreams come true"  
And this song of mine in three-quarter time  
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too
