Just knocking around the zoo  
On a Thursday afternoon,  
There's bars on all the windows  
And they're counting up the spoons, yeah.  
And if I'm feeling edgy,  
There's a chick who's paid  
To be my slave, yeah, watch out James.  
But she'll hit me with a needle  
If she thinks I'm trying to misbehave.  
  
Now the keeper's trying to cool me  
Says I'm bound to be all right,  
But I know that he can't fool me  
'Cause I'm putting him uptight, yeah.  
And I can feel him getting edgy  
Every time I make a sudden move,  
Whoa, yes it's true.  
And I can hear them celebrating  
Every time I up and leave the room.  
  
Now my friends all come to see me,  
They just point at me and stare.  
Said, he's just like the rest of us  
So what's he doing there?  
They hide in their movie theaters  
Drinking juice, keeping tight,  
Watch that bright light.  
'Cause they're certain about one thing, babe,  
That zoo's no place to spend the night, no.  
  
Just knocking around the zoo  
On a Thursday afternoon,  
There's bars on all the windows  
And they're counting up the spoons, yeah.  
And if I'm feeling edgy,  
There's a chick who's paid to be my slave,  
Watch out Kootch.  
But she'll hit me with a needle  
If she thinks I'm trying to misbehave.
