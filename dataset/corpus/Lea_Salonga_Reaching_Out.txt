What must I do, to make you understand  
You mean everything to me  
Don't have the strength to say, give this heart of mine a chance  
Maybe then you will see  
I'll do anything, do anything, that you tell me  
I'll be there, I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Reaching out to you, do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I want to do  
I'm completely sure, I've never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
What must I do, so I can make you see  
The light that shines in my eyes  
You brighten up my day  
You even help me find my way  
I wish your always by my side  
  
And I can't stop, don't know how to stop, thinking of you  
And i'll do anything, do anything, to be near you  
Reaching out to you do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure, never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
Reaching out to you, do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure, never felt this way before  
Deep inside you know that there is something more  
Deep inside you know that there is something more
