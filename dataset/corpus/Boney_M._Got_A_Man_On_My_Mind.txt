Walk around in circles  
Without peace and little sleep  
Can't cool down and unwind  
What I'm feeling is a feeling  
That's just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Haven't seen him for so long  
He's always on the go  
Not the sticking round kind  
I don't care whatever happens  
One thing I do know  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin' into space  
And I talk about how I feel (yeah yeah)  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and he's quite real  
Never thought that I could care  
For anyone that much  
Oh how wrong can you be  
I'm so hungry for his kisses  
For his tender touch  
He's the whole world for me  
Oooh  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Can't cool down and unwind  
What I'm feeling is a feeling  
That's just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin' into space  
And I talk about how I feel (oh yeah)  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and he's quite real  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Got a man on my mind  
I'm hungry for kisses  
I'm thirsty for love  
Got a man on my mind
