Once our love was drifting  
I felt left out and alone  
There was nothing more that I could do  
I lost my hold on you  
  
And through it all I kept my faith  
In the good things from the past  
Then one day out of the blue  
You came back to me  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
  
Holding on to something  
'cause it feels so right  
You don't doubt it for a minute  
Day or night  
  
You know you've got to keep the faith  
Don't let it slip away  
Knew one day that you'd return  
And together we will stay  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
  
If we believe there's a future  
Take the time to remember  
That the setting sun will always rise again  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun
