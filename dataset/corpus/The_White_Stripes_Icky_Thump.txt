Ya he, icky thump  
Who'd a thunk?  
Sittin' drunk  
On a wagon to Mexico  
  
Her hair  
What a chump  
And my head  
Got a bump  
When I hit it on the radio  
  
Redhead senorita  
Lookin' dead  
Came to, said  
'I need a bed' in Espanol  
  
So I gave a drink of water  
I'm gonna sing around the collar  
Well, I don't need a microphone  
  
Yeah  
Icky thump  
With the lump  
In my throat  
Grab my coat  
And now it's reckoned  
I was ready to go  
  
Yeah, I swam beside the hair  
She had one white eye  
One blank stare  
Lookin' up, lyin' there  
  
On a stand in her hair  
Was a candy cane  
Black rum, sugar cane  
Dry eye  
Somethin' strange!  
  
La la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
  
Well, Americans  
What, nothin' better to do?  
Why don't you kick yourself out?  
You're an immigrant too  
  
Who's usin' who?  
What should we do?  
Well, you can't be a pimp  
And a prostitute too  
  
Icky thump  
Handcuffed to a bunk  
Robbed blind  
Looked around  
And there was nobody else  
  
Left alone  
I hit myself with a stone  
Went home  
And learned how to clean up after myself
