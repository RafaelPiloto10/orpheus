Met a fine red boned mami, she told me that her name was Lucille  
Met her on Fountain Avenue sitting on a Cadillac Coupe de Ville  
She said I'm a liar, a thief, a junkie and I used to be a whore  
And I've been trying to shake this monkey so long I just can't take it no more  
  
I got a weakness, I got a hunger, I got a jones  
I'm sick and I need to get well, I hurt deep in my bone  
I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst  
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble  
Just waiting for it to burst?  
  
We talked all afternoon, she made me cry, I told some jokes  
She looked me deep in my eyes and told me love was nothing but a cruel hoax  
Her grandmother died when she was five and she never did know her folks  
Her father fell in a gun fight and her mother by an overdose  
  
I got a weakness I got a hunger, I got a jones  
I'm sick and I need to get well, I hurt deep in my bones  
I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst  
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble  
Just waiting for it to burst  
  
She said I've slept with gangsters, thugs and smugglers, congressman and
governors  
I've seen therapists and holy men but this weakness is my only friend  
It feeds my need it numbs my soul, it starts to creep and takes control  
Sell my flesh I pierce my skin  
And tomorrow I'ma do it all again  
  
I got a weakness I got a hunger I got a jones  
I'm sick and I need to get well  
I hurt deep in my bones.  
I got a weakness, I got a fever, I got a thirst,  
I'm sitting on the edge of the bubble  
Just waiting for it to burst?
