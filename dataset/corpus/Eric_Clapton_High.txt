High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering,  
Trying to put my mind at rest,  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die.  
  
He was once a friend of mine,  
But I did not know or care  
Until she said goodbye.  
I cried till I could hardly see  
The meaning of my life.  
What do I do now?  
  
High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering,  
Trying to put my mind at rest,  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die.
