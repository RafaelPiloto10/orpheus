The ol log is burnin'  
Yellow and red  
Small eyes are fightin'  
That ol' sleepy head  
Stockin's are filled  
While stories of goodwill are told  
At the edge of the bed.  
It's an old time Christmas  
Family and friends 'round the tree  
It's an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory.  
Now the gifts are all open  
The kids in the yard  
Granddad nods off in a chair  
And the smells from the kitchen  
Are to fine to mention  
And there's peace  
On Earth everywhere.  
It's an old time Christmas  
Family and friends 'round the tree  
It's an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory.  
Church bells ringin'  
Choirs singin' everywhere  
There's love in the air  
It's an old time Christmas  
Family and friends 'roubd the tree  
It's an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory.  
It's an old time Christmas  
Like the ones in my memory...
