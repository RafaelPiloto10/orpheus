"That must be it"  
  
Through the summer rain of 1845  
The coach had finally arrived  
To the valley where the crossroads meet below  
And where all darkness seems to grow  
People blame it on the Hill  
The hill where no one dares to go  
The Mansion  
  
The coach had stopped and from the window you could see  
Seven horsemen in the night  
Miriam Natias and Jonathan LaFey  
Saw the magic in their eyes  
They were in for a surprise  
The darkness would soon be complete  
A horseman came forth from the dark  
  
"We know you've come to inherit what's your's, the mansion  
Take our advise and go back on this night  
If you refuse eighteen will become nine, oh no"  
Oh eighteen is nine  
  
Jonathan laughed and said "get out of my way"  
"I don't believe a word You say"  
The seven horsemen disappeared into the night  
And said "someday you'll need our help my friend"  
  
I think poor Jonathan was scared  
  
Eighteen is actually nine, it stuck in his mind
