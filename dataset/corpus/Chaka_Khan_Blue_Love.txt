Blue love, why'd you have to go and make me sad and blue  
Love, you're the only one I gave it to and  
  
You can't believe that I'm dying for you  
Can't you see I've been trying for you  
I just can't stop this crying for you, ooh-ooh  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to  
  
Blue love, who could ever think that you would be untrue  
Love, I'll do anything you want me to 'cause  
  
You can't believe that I'm trying for you  
Can't you see I've been crying for you  
I just can't stop this crying for you, oh you  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to blue  
  
Tony:  
I been hanging on such a long, long time  
Waiting for the return of your smiling face  
Chaka:  
And the test and the time that changed every mind can't you see  
That my world is an unhappy place  
Tony:  
Oh this love in my heart is tearing me apart  
Chaka:  
Need ya here wit me how happy we could be  
Tony:  
Together  
Chaka:  
Us forever  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to blue
