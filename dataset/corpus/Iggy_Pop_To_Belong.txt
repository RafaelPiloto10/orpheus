A bird is sitting on the pavement  
Someone broke his wing  
Now that bird is going nowhere  
And he's suffering  
  
Now I understand the setup  
I see everything  
And the only way to go  
Is defy, is defy, is defy  
  
To belong here, to belong here, to belong here  
I'm giving up my soul  
To belong, to belong, to belong  
  
A spider is sitting in a corner  
Gonna catch a fly  
The web is pulling tight around him  
And the fly's I  
But all I do is guard my pile  
Cause it's my supply  
And the only way to go  
Is defy, is defy, is defy  
  
To belong here, to belong here, to belong here  
I'm giving up my soul
