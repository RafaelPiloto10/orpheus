Whoa  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Whoa  
  
Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between "I wish I could"  
And "I don't know"  
Rain is splashing up between  
Her toes  
She doesn't know her own area code  
She's the picture  
Of a heart of gold  
On the edge of depression I note  
And a picture  
Of the wrong high road  
Now it's too late for  
A fight or foe  
  
Now she's lookin' at me to know  
The faucet's runnin'  
And my car got towed  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Whoa  
  
Did you see the man  
With the cocaine load?  
It's on sale for the price of your soul  
And a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
Sell you all your pain 10-fold  
And you're calling  
Out a long, wrong road  
Fitted for the box they mold  
All you're missing is  
A heart they stole  
They're lookin' at me to know  
My heart is pumpin'  
And my feet got cold  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not  
Yeah  
Sure  
I'm sure that I'm not  
Sure  
You know, oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh huh  
  
Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between "I wish I could"  
And "I don't know"  
There's a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
  
They're lookin' at me to know  
My heart is pumpin'  
And my feet got cold  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure about it  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
That I'm not  
Yeah  
You know, oh yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Oh yeah
