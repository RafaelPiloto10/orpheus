It must be the end of the road  
It must be the end of you and I  
And forever too  
Walking the last bridge alone  
We've given up on the good times  
And the bad we knew  
  
When I'm alone in a cold, dark room, well  
There's still someone  
That I can tell my troubles to  
  
Me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
When did it start getting old?  
When did it stop being worth the time  
Just to see it through?  
I don't wanna get used to "It's over"  
We've already said too much  
To make it new  
  
When I'm alone in a cold, dark room, well  
There's still someone  
That I can tell my troubles to  
  
Me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
Well, it's hard to see you don't belong to me  
'Cause I gave you the best part of my life  
Well, I tried to be everything that you want me to be  
But I don't have to give you reasons why  
'Cause all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
I'm not gonna try to forget  
Maybe happiness  
Is worth the chance of a bitter end  
'Cause here at the end of the road  
I don't really care who is right  
I'll give you the last word tonight  
  
'Cause me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I
