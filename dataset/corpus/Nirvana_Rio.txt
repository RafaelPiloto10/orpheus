Wow!  
  
Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise  
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice  
With a step to your left and a flick to the right  
You catch that mirror way out west  
You know you're something special  
And you look like you're the best  
  
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand  
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land  
And when she shines she really shows you all she can  
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande  
  
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on tv  
Two of a billion stars it means so much to me  
Like a birthday or a pretty view  
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you  
  
Hey now look at that did he nearly run you down  
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive you make me feel  
Alive, alive, alive  
  
I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side  
I tell you something I know what you're thinking  
I tell you something I know what you're thinking  
  
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand  
Just like that river twists across a dusty land  
And when she shines she really shows you all she can  
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande  
  
Her name is rio she don't need to understand  
I might find her if I'm looking like I can  
Oh rio rio hear them shout across the land  
From mountains in the north down to the rio grande
