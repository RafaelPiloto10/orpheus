When I'm walking down the street  
On a quite afternoon  
When I hear our favorite song  
and it gets me in the mood  
When I don't know who I am  
and the world is not my friend  
When I fight my way back up again  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want you with me every move I make  
I want you to see all that I see  
Through the laughter and the madness  
and every moment in between  
Oh, I want you with me  
  
When I tell my daddy bye  
for the very last time  
When I learn a whole new love  
in our baby's first cry  
When you can tell I've done it all  
  
by the lines on my face  
When I start regretting my mistakes  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I want you with me  
Oh, oh yeah  
I want you with me
