Little by little by little by little by little  
Little by little by little by little by little  
  
You're messing up my life  
Tearing me apart  
Breaking up my world  
And I'm giving up my heart  
Little by little by little by little  
  
I'm losing all my pride  
It's really getting bad  
Hurting deep inside  
Is a-making me go mad, ooh  
Little by little by little by little  
  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I'm going crazy and you're causing it  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I should stop caring  
But my love won't quit  
  
Little by little by little by little by little, yeah  
Little by little by little by little by little, all right  
  
I don't know where to turn  
Don't know what to do  
I'm walking on thin ice  
And it seems I'm falling through, ooh  
Little by little by little by little  
  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I'm going crazy and you're causing it  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I should stop caring  
But my love won't quit  
  
I'm the queen of fools  
Know the deck is stacked  
On a losing streak  
But I'm a-going to get you back  
  
Little by little by little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Yeah, little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Ah, ah, ah, little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Little by little, mmm  
(Little by little by little by little by)
