Above all things there must be love  
And following your deepest soul  
You look like you need some fun  
I'm dying to sail into the sun  
Dreamers ask what've I become  
  
I can see that shoreline star  
Pulling me to worlds so far  
Taking me and pulling hard  
Away from judgment's own backyard  
Away from judgment's own backyard  
  
Why should I change for anyone?  
Why should my chains break or come undone?  
And I'll sing glory hallelujah I'm coming home  
Baby don't rescue me, don't rescue me  
'Cause I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be  
  
Do you hear my melodies?  
Do you hear my Van Gogh's cry?  
Will it be my brother's purchase?  
Even only when I die? Even only when I die  
  
Why should I change for anyone?  
Why should my chains break or come undone?  
And I'll sing glory hallelujah I'm coming home  
Baby don't rescue me, don't rescue me  
'Cause I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be  
  
I been up and down, I been all around  
In the sky and baby on the ground  
High as the sun, deep as the sea  
Rain has been falling all over me  
I want to live in harmony  
I know what I need to be free  
Baby, please don't rescue me 'cause I'm gonna be...
