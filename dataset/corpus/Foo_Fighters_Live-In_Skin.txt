Take your payroll  
And your lottery  
There's a place I know  
There's a robbery  
  
And I swear I'll never tell  
If you swear you'll never tell  
And we'll all make out so well  
We will all make out so well  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
I'm amazed that I'm still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
I'm amounted  
  
Just the same old  
Glitter story  
From the sea floor  
Metamorphosis  
And I can't change back for you  
I will not change back for you  
I must live in skin that's new  
I'm a livid skin that's new  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
I'm amazed that I'm still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
I'm amounted  
  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
  
I'm amounted  
  
And I can't change back for you  
No I can't change back for you
