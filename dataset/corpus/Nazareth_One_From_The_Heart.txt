I've seen that girl before, I've seen the boys come and go  
And still shes on her own  
I've seen those tears before, I've seen her heart break  
She knows what it means to be alone  
  
There must be another way to spend her life  
While she is waiting  
  
She knows the dangers there, these love affairs  
Run hot, run cold and always take their toll  
Its another lonely night inside those empty rooms  
She knows will never be a home  
There must be etc.  
  
For one from the heart  
Shes on her knees  
One from the heart, that's all she needs  
One from the heart, she can believe  
  
I've seen that girl before, I've seen boys that come and go  
And still shes on her own  
I hope somewhere, somehow, ssomeday  
Shell find that special one before her heart turns cold.
