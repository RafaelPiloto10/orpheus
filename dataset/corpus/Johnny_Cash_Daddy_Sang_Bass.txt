I remember when I was a lad  
Times were hard and things were bad  
But there's a silver linin' behind ev'ry cloud  
Just four people that 's all we were  
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt  
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud  
  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it won't be long  
I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Though the circle won't be broken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us  
You could hear us singin' for a country mile  
Now little brother has done gone on  
But I'll rejoin him in a song  
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while  
  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
'Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it won't be long  
I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Oh no the circle won't be broken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
