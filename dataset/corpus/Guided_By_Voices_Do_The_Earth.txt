Here's a picture from the house of meat  
Are you the person I'm scheduled to meet  
To assess my skeleton's worth?  
Do the earth  
Curtains open and the guests are fried  
In my attempt to seem dignified  
I re-enact my birth  
Do the earth  
do the earth I wanna ramble in opium fields  
Playing tricks on the invasion boys  
Penetrator like a space invader - do the earth  
Do the earth- this tear will never wash away  
On any human sanitation day  
And I will starve to death and wither away  
Unless you feed me  
I'm too tired to run from the tiger  
I'm too dumb to hide in the bushes  
I'm a human costume with veins of gold  
I'll face the punching bag - do what I'm told  
Til I get old and have to dwell  
In the valley of the ironman  
do the earth -- you beckon me and leave it up to fate  
You offer salvation and I salivate  
And the thought of my next free cheese  
Hear the voice
