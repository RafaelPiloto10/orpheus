I am love, I am hate  
I'm an atheist with faith  
Vent my anger with a smile  
I'm polite or obscene  
Either whisper or I scream  
I'm not quite what I seem  
I'm somewhere in between  
  
I am young in my old age  
I am calm or in a rage  
I'm your friend or enemy  
A pacifist or at war  
I am rich but I am poor  
I'm all extremes  
I'm nowhere in between  
  
Wide awake  
Or in a dream  
Nowhere in between  
Like the pulse of a machine  
I'm driven to extremes  
  
I feel the turmoil boil in me  
I'm neither healthy nor diseased  
I am all extremes  
But I'm still in between  
  
Say right or say wrong  
Outcast yet I belong  
I'm high or I'm dry  
Say I am weak yet I am strong  
  
In between  
In between  
  
I am my alter ego  
I am subconsciously  
In depth but also shallow  
Or somewhere in between  
  
Oh I know I am  
Always first in line or last  
I swim with sharks or drown with rats  
I'll defend as I attack  
My world and yours are not the same  
I am in a different lane  
I am not where I seem  
But I'm somewhere in between  
  
I seek revenge  
As I forgive  
I die to live ah  
Not afraid but scared to death  
I don't fit in  
  
In between all extremes
