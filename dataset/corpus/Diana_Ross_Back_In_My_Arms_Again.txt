All day long I hear my telephone ring  
Friends calling giving their advice  
From the boy I love, I should break away  
'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day  
  
I lost him once through friends advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
'Cause all advice is ever gotten me  
Was many long and sleepless nights  
  
Oh, but now he's back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
It's easy for friends to say let him go  
But I'm the one who needs him so  
It's his love that makes me strong  
Without him I can't go on  
  
This time I'll life my life at ease  
Being happy lovin' whom I please  
And each time we make romance  
I'll be thankful for a second chance  
  
Oh, 'cause he's back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
How can Mary tell me what to do  
When she lost her love so true?  
And Flo, she don't know  
'Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo  
  
I listened once to my friends advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
'Cause all advice is ever gotten me  
Was many long and sleepless nights  
  
Oh, I got him back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
Oh, I'm satisfied, yeah, so satisfied  
I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied, so satisfied  
I'm satisfied, so satisfied
