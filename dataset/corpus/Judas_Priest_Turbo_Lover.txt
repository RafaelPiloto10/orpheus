You won't hear me,  
But you'll feel me  
Without warning, somethings dawning, listen.  
Then within your senses,  
You'll know you're defenseless  
How your heart beats, when you run for cover  
You can't retreat I spy like no other.  
Then we race together.  
We can ride forever  
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury  
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive  
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive  
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky  
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek  
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak  
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load  
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover
