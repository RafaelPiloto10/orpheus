The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
His wings as drifted snow  
His eyes as flame  
From God all hail the angel said to Mary  
Most highly favoured lady  
Gloria  
"Fear not for you shall bear a holy child  
By him to God be reconciled  
His name shall be Emmanuel  
The long-foretold"  
Most highly favoured lady  
Gloria  
Then gentle Mary humbly bowed her head  
"To me be as it pleaseth God" she said  
"My soul shall praise and magnify his Holy name"  
Most highly favoured lady  
Gloria  
And so she said "How happy I shall be  
All generations will remember me  
For God has kept his promises to Israel"  
Most highly favoured lady  
Gloria  
Of her Emmanuel the Christ was born  
On Bethlehem upon that Christmas morn  
And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say  
Most highly favoured lady  
Gloria
