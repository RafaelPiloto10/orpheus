I told you lady  
Take me for one day  
Please don't ask any questions  
You know I can stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I know isn't this crazy  
Let's have a last drink  
Don't ask where I come from  
And don't ask what I think  
I leave you, lady  
Full of desire to stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I told you  
Take me for one day  
Don't ask any questions  
You know I can stay  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me  
  
I wish the wind was cold  
I want to hold you baby hold  
Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me
