Baby when I think about (about, about)  
The day that we first met (the day that we first met)  
Wasn't lookin' for what I found  
But I found you  
And I'm bound to by happiness in being around you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you  
I'm glad for the way you make me feel  
I love it cause you seem to blow my mind every time  
I'm glad when I walk you hold my hand  
I'm happy that you know how to be a man  
I'm glad that you came into my life  
I'm so glad  
  
I dig the way that you get down  
(You get down for 'bout)  
And you still know how to hold me  
(And you still know how to hold me)  
Perfect blend, masculine  
I think I'm in love, damn finally  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm glad, that you, turned out, to be  
That certain someone special  
Who makes this life worth living  
I'm glad, you're here, just loving me  
So say that you won't leave  
Cause since the day you came  
I've been glad  
  
[Chorus]
