Hurry up, before I get another date  
Hurry up, well it's gettin' awful late  
Well I told you when I walked you home  
And I told you on the telephone  
That I'd be here at a quarter to nine  
Oh little girl ain't you ever on time  
Nothin' bugs me baby like a-havin' to wait  
But it always seems to happen everytime we have a date  
Hurry up, well c'mon let's go  
Hurry up, we'll be late for the show  
Hurry up, oh yeah, hurry up  
  
We got to the movie baby wouldn't you know  
The only seats I saw were in the very last row  
I there sat down and I tried to watch the show  
When you look at your watch, you say c 'mon let's go
