Silver Bells  
  
Silver Bells  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Silver Bells  
  
  
  
City sidewalks  
  
Busy sidewalks  
  
Dressed in holiday style  
  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing  
  
People passing  
  
Meeting smile after smile  
  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
  
  
Silver Bells  
  
Silver Bells  
  
It's Christmas time in the city  
  
Ting-a-ling  
  
Ting-a-ling  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Soon it will be Christmas Day
