When we got our redundancy, myself and the lads went on  
The spree  
A brand new passport in my hand as we took off for The  
Netherland  
Myself and Dinny and O'Dwyer and Scut at Schiphol we  
Were all half cut  
We opened up the duty-free, the red lemonade and brandy  
And we jumped on board a tram  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
Our first stop was the coffee shop, in we went and we  
All sparked up  
Hashish from Pakistan, Morocco, Nepal and the Lebanon  
All the boys was rollin' joints, they forgot to drink  
Their pints  
Water pipe came bubblin' around, took one pull and hit  
The ground  
Lads wake him if you can  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
Sunday we went to The Blarney Stone, Paddy Wynne had  
The Leinster Final on  
The Lily Whites and The Boys in Blue, the Majors and  
Taytos  
Over to Mulligan's for the night, the bar was leppin'  
And the band was shite  
De Burgh, De Bono and De Wolfe Tones'til Dinny grabbed  
The microphone  
And gave us Van The Man  
Oh The weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
Macker sez while we're here we'll go and have a look at  
The kinky gear  
I said a quiet prayer I wouldn't bump into anyone from  
Kildare  
Big dildos, blow-up dolls, snap-on tools and hairy  
Balls  
Vibrators, whips and chains, zips and fanny ticklers  
God between us and all harm  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
Then we went for a midnight walk, all our eyes were out  
On stalks  
Gay bars, bordellos, models in the windows with no  
Clothes  
Dinny he danced all night with a South American  
Transvestite  
Everything was goin' grand until Dinny tried to drop  
The hand There was pandemonium  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
The bouncer she was 5' 10", Lowland Heavyweight  
Champion  
She hit Dinny an awful box, the boys ran amok and  
Wrecked the shop  
We could hear the squad cars getting near, it's time  
Lads we were out of here  
Dinny pulled up his tights and we disappeared into the  
Night  
All together now one by one  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam  
  
Queen Beatrix she rides her bike, Rembrandt is hangin'  
Down in The Rijk  
Ajax, Heineken, Van Gogh, The Gargle and The Ghanja  
Monday morning we were all half cracked we dived into  
The Kaisergracht  
They fished us out, hosed us down and put us on the  
Plane to Dublin Home to the Mammy again  
Oh The Weekend that we spent in Amsterdam
