Well she was just seventeen  
You know what I mean  
And the way she looked  
Was way beyond compare  
So how could I dance with another,  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well she looked at me  
And I, I could see  
That before too long  
I'd fall in love with her  
She wouldn't dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well my heart went boom  
When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
  
Oh we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long  
I fell in love with her  
Now I'll never dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well my heart went boom  
When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
  
Oh we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long  
I fell in love with her  
Now I'll never dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
Oh, since I saw her standing there  
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
