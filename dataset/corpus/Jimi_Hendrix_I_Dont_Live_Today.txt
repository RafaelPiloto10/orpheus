Will I live tomorrow?  
Well I just can't say  
Will I live tomorrow?  
Well I just can't say  
But I know for sure  
I don't live today  
  
No sun comin' through my windows  
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave  
No sun comin' through my windows  
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave  
  
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me  
So I can be on my miserable way  
  
I don't, live today  
Maybe tomorrow, I just can say  
But a, I don't live today  
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this  
  
Well  
I don't live today  
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't tell you baby  
But a, I don't live today  
It's such a shame spending the time away like this  
  
Yeah!  
  
There ain't no life no where
