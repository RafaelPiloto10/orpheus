It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
Let's go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
I'll take you honky tonkin' in my old pick up truck  
It's dance time in Texas and the music lifts you up  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
Now it's time for a slow dance and we're waltzing oh so close  
It's dance time in Texas and your the one I love the most  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows
