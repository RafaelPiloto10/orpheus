How many times I say the words  
Again and again and again and again  
A thousand different ways I say I love you  
  
And I tell myself I can and I can  
If I say the words again and again  
A thousand different ways I say I need you  
  
When I'm with you walls will crumble  
I sit down I stand I stumble  
Every word I mumble comes out wrong  
  
And again I try, trip and fall,  
Burn inside and again I call your name...  
  
And I want to dance this dance with you  
This crazy dance for two  
And dancing I' ll pretend  
Everything's alright  
And you, stay with me tonight  
Baby...  
  
Lately I've said these words  
Again and again and again and again  
Don't know if there's anyone to listen  
  
And I tell myself I can and I can  
'Cause I didn't run when the others ran  
And never really cared what I was missing  
  
When I'm near you I'm the queen or I'm nothing  
Or I'm in between  
Always running not so sure where to...  
  
And you, again your face  
Touch me but you won' t embrace me  
Why?  
  
And I want to dance this dance with you  
This crazy dance for two  
And dancing I' ll pretend  
Everything's alright  
And you, stay with me tonight  
Baby..  
  
And I want to dance this dance with you  
This crazy dance for two  
And dancing I' ll pretend  
Everything' s alright  
And you, stay with me tonight  
Maybe..  
  
Again and again and again  
A thousand different words for keeping still  
  
And I tell myself try something new,  
There are a thousand things that you can do  
And I know I can...  
And I know I never will.
