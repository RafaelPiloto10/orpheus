Cannot hear what your saying  
Could I tell you so  
And I can't believe my troubles  
And I'm going home  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
You know  
  
While the cold winter waitin'  
While it's turning cold  
All these things we were searchin'  
Now we just don't know  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
I think you know  
  
For the rhymes of an hour  
Now I'm going home  
And I can't believe I'm nothing  
'Cause I'm coming down  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
Do you know?
