BY LOVE I MEAN  
  
Ran away, would of stay  
But loneliness made me afraid  
My heart decided and my feet obeyed  
Now I'm living just to love you  
  
Day again, night again  
I'm waiting for a ride again  
I need to be inside again  
And a friendly fire to warm me  
  
[Chorus:]  
By love I mean  
We'll be alone together  
By love I mean  
I want to spend my life with you  
By love I mean  
I will need or want no other  
That's what I mean by love  
  
Back again, inside again  
Feeling I'm alive again  
Got my lover, got my friend again  
And I got some pride inside me  
  
Ran away, would of stay  
But loneliness made me afraid  
My heart decided and my feet obeyed  
Now I'm living just to love you  
  
[Chorus]
