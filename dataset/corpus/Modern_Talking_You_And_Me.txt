Love delight, deep inside  
I'm sharing all my love with you  
Oh, I know I can't live without you girl  
I can't live without you  
Take me away  
Make my day  
Every time I see your face  
Oh, I know I can't live without your love  
That I can't live without you  
There's one life to live  
And one heart to give  
Tell me that you need  
Body heat  
Just turn out the lights  
  
You and me  
Dreams are free  
Just a woman and a man, babe  
You and me  
Can't you see  
That I'm doing what I can, babe  
Babe, you and me  
Ecstasy  
And I never want to lose you  
To the end of the world  
Oh, I'll stay by your side  
You and me  
Oh, I feel  
Like the moon was made for lonely  
You and me  
Oh it's real  
You are the one and you're the only  
You and me  
Memories  
All the love that's never ending  
To the end of the world  
Oh, I'll stay by your side  
  
It's getting late  
And I can't wait  
The ocean beating in my heart  
Oh, I know I can't live without you girl  
I can't live without you  
I call your name  
Again and again  
I lose my soul, my self-control  
Oh, I know that I can't live without your love  
That I can't live without you  
There's one life to live  
And one heart to give  
Tell me that you need, body heat  
Just turn out the lights
