I'm in need of a remedy  
To cure me from loving you  
It may sound a little extreme  
But I'll do what I have to do  
Bury your jacket in my backyard  
Carry your picture in my shoe  
And keep walkin' till the hurting stops  
Keep walkin' till my temperature drops  
Keep walkin' until the fever is gone  
And you're out of my bones  
  
I'm in need of medicine  
Something strong that will work real fast  
That I can take to fortify me  
To keep my arms from taking you back  
Chase that ghost out from under my bed  
Still daylight till dawn  
Till you're out of my bones  
  
Sweet amnesia  
Come and set me free  
I just need to  
Get you out of me  
  
Bury your jacket in my backyard  
Carry your picture in my shoe  
And keep walkin' till the hurting stops  
Keep walkin' till my temperature drops  
Keep walkin' until the fever is gone  
And you're out of my bones  
You're out of my bones
