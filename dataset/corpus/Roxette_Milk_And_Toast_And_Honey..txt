Milk and toast and honey make it sunny  
On a rainy Saturday, he-he-hey  
Milk and toast, some coffee take the stuffiness  
Out of days you hate, you really hate  
Slow morning news pass me by I try  
Not to analyze but didn't he blow my  
Mind this time  
Didn't he blow my mind?  
  
(here he comes)  
To bring a little lovin' honey  
To take away the hurt  
Inside is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want in life  
  
Milk and  
Toast and honey  
  
To bring a little lovin', honey  
To take away the pain inside is everything  
That matters to me  
Is everything  
I want from life  
(here he comes)  
Oh lay  
A little lovin', baby  
To feel you're gettin'  
Close to me is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want to be  
  
Ain't it funny how things sometimes look so  
Clear and feel so near  
The dreams I dream,  
My favorite wishful thinkin'  
Oh he's  
Bookmarked everywhere, everywhere  
True  
Love might fall from the sky  
You never know  
What to find but didn't he blow my mind this time  
Didn't he blow my mind?  
  
(here he comes)
