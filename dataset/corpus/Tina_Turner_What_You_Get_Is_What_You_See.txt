Some boys got the look of a Greek Adonis  
Some boys try to talk you off your feet  
Some boys think they're gods gift to woman  
Some boys think they're sweet enough to eat  
Try to change the habit of a lifetime  
Don't even try  
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing  
You realize  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
Some guys got lips that you can't help kissing  
And some guys got a smile you can't resist  
Some guys gotta build a reputation  
They just want to add you to the list  
You got a lot of physical attraction  
I can't deny  
But can you guarantee me satisfaction  
While I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
So let me see your cards on the table  
Before I buy  
I always read the writing on the label  
So give me reason to believe there's more to you than meets the eye
