I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff  
A magic mushroom cloud of care  
A potion that will rock the boat will rock  
Make a bomb of love and blow it up  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
It was me right or wrong  
I did it Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for us all  
  
It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done  
The truth is that I don't really care  
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time  
You better lock me up I'll do it again  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
It was me right or wrong  
I did it  
Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for the buzz  
  
All you people are the skewers of our dreams  
Like the cat that collared me  
Oh what I gotta say to you got love don't  
Turn it down  
Turn it loud  
Let it build  
We got a long way to go  
But you gotta start somewhere  
Go door to door spread the love you got  
You got the love  
You get what you want  
Does it matter where you get it from  
I for one  
Don't turn my cheek for anyone  
Unturn your cheek to give your love  
Love to grow  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
  
Was me right or wrong  
I did it  
Yeah  
I did it  
I told you I told you I told you I told  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
I told you I told you I told you I  
I did it  
Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtain I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for us all
