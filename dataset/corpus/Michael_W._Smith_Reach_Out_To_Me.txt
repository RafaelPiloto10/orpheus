Another million miles from the Truth now  
I know there's peace but I can't seem  
To figure out how  
To stop this race that's taking over me  
I'm under the gun I wait for You to see  
  
Oh, please reach out to me  
Open my eyes to see  
I'm running from you now  
Come rescue me somehow  
  
Another scar from fighting the Truth now  
Has left me like a stranger to my need now  
A masquerade, a game to figure out now  
A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud  
  
A narrow stretch of road in the way now  
A heavy load still hanging on to me now  
I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out  
Without a view from these shoulders of doubt
