There were other loves before I found you  
And I wish sometimes that we had never met  
For life without you darling can never be the same  
For having loved you once I can't forget (Forget)  
  
I remember all your smiles and laughter (And laughter)  
I remember love light shining in your eyes  
And though I only had you for just a little while  
When you were there the whole world seemed so right  
  
(All) I remember these things through bitter tears  
(All) The touch of your hand in mine  
(All) And though you're not here through the lonely years  
With memories of you I'll never be the alone  
  
There'll maybe other arms to soothe my sadness  
There will be other loves that I have never met  
But life without you darling can never be the same  
For having loved you once I can't forget you  
  
(For life without you darling can never be the same)  
For having loved you once  
(For having loved you once)  
I can't  
(I can't)  
Forget  
(I know I can't I can't forget)
