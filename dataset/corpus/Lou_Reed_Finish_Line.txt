Wind blows snow outside my windows  
Crowd below runs wild in the streets  
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Down in the train yard out by the stockyard  
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow  
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing  
Just like these feelings I have for you  
And nothing's forever not even five minutes  
When you're headed for the finish line  
  
Down in the depot out by the meat rack  
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail  
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles  
They're heading for the finish line  
  
They're lining up for Noah's Ark  
They're stabbing each other in the dark  
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Close to the line the ice is cracking  
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands  
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for  
All of a sudden it comes back to me  
  
Just up ahead is the finish line  
Two rented referees and two checkered rags  
Out of the corner of my eye comes a  
Dark horse with black wings  
Headed for the finish line  
  
I'm five years old the room is fuzzy  
I think there's also a very young girl  
It's hard to remember what happened exactly  
As I'm staring at the finish line  
First came fire then came light  
Then came feeling then cane sight
