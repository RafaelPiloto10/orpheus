Thrift  
I sit here all knowing  
Knowing nothing here at all, yeah  
My cuts spread slower  
Pig hands reach into my sides, yeah  
I hate this life you give me  
I give you hate you live for me, yeah  
I love the pain you give me  
This hurting feels like love to me, yeah  
They go down town down town  
They go  
  
Down inside  
Down inside  
Down inside  
They go down town down town  
They go down town to sell  
Down town down town  
They go down town to sell  
  
My body hangs on hooks  
A cloth to society, yeah  
Your dollars wet my skin  
Makes me paper mache thrift, yeah

I give you hate you live for me, yeah  
I love the pain you give me  
This hurting feels like love to me, yeah  
They go down town down town

Down inside  
Down inside  
Down inside  
They go down town down town  
They go down town to sell  
Down town down town
