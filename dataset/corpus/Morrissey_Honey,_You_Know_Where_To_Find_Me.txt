The future is around me  
I'm not gonna cry for the things that never occurred  
So do not remind me  
Happy to be as I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The envy is beyond me  
I'm not gonna pine for the things that can never be mine  
Do not expect me to  
I'm happy to be who I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The future is around me  
I see it, I seize it, I use it, I throw it away  
Because I'm happy to be like I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Running away from the mundane  
La la la la la la  
  
Oh honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you'll find how to know me  
Oh, la la la la la la  
  
Oh honey, you know how the land lies  
La la la la la la la la la
