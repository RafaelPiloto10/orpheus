In the little village of Bethlehem  
There lay a Child one day  
And the sky was bright with a holy light  
O'er the place where Jesus lay.  
  
Refrain:  
Alleluia! O how the angels sang  
Alleluia! How it rang!  
And the sky was bright with a holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King.  
  
''Twas a humble birthplace, but O how much  
God gave to us that day  
From the manger bed what a path has led  
What a perfect, holy way.  
  
Refrain:  
Alleluia! O how the angels sang  
Alleluia! How it rang!  
And the sky was bright with a holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King.
