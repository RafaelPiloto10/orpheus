He's a tramp but they love him  
Breaks a new heart every day  
He's a tramp, they adore him  
And I only hope he'll stay that way  
He's a tramp, he's a scoundrel  
He's a rounder, he's a cad  
He's a tramp but I love him  
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad  
You can never tell when he'll show up  
He gives you plenty of trouble  
I guess, he's just a no account pup  
But I wish that he were double  
He's a tramp, he's a rover  
And there's nothing more to say  
If he's a tramp, he's a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
You can never tell when he'll show up  
He gives you plenty of trouble  
I guess, he's just a no account pup  
But I wish that he were double  
He's a tramp, he's a rover  
And there's nothing more to say  
If he's a tramp, he's a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
I wish that I could travel his way  
What a dog
