Backdoor to heaven  
  
Well, now we're alone  
My heart's in your hands I need someone to love  
Can't I be your friend I feel your rebel to me, baby  
  
Won't you give me what's wrong or right now  
You got me praying oh baby, on my knees  
Won't you let me in, let me in, let me in  
Your backdoor to heaven is in your arms tonight  
You're my backdoor to heaven  
Won't you let me in, let me in, let me in  
  
I'm just a sinner but ain't that all the same  
So let me in, let me in, let me in  
The backdoor to heaven is in your arms to heaven  
You're my backdoor to heaven  
Baby you gotta let me in, let me in, let me in  
The backdoor to heaven  
Yeah, baby, it's my time  
You're my backdoor to heaven.
