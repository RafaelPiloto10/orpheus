[Intro:]  
Ladies and gentlemen  
We are gathered here today  
To join  
I see it, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
I like this right here  
Yeah, yeah  
One-two, one-two, in the place to be  
As you can see  
I am the crush groovin'  
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight  
The record breaking and the record making  
Yeah, yeah, turn this up  
  
From the states to over seas  
Every city in between I hit the scene  
Catch fire like kerosene  
Geting paid for more then a decade  
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the pd invasion  
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars  
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar  
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?  
No one important, just another nigga flossing  
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real  
You just a clone wit' a production deal  
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water  
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya  
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth  
Hottest niggas out  
Alot better, the shit's too strong  
I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long  
  
1 - [lil' kim]  
What you niggas want  
Wanna talk slick  
Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit  
Who you fucking wit'  
You and your weak clique  
Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit  
You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret  
Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with  
You can't run, you can't hide  
Bad boy 'till the day we die  
  
Tell they all like jordan in the fall  
On top of the hill like lauren, killing 'em soft'  
What you grillin' me for?  
Kept my name good, we from the same hood  
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood  
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me  
Wanna grind on me  
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me  
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping  
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching  
At all times, put it all on the line  
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares  
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust  
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust  
It get like that though, when you stack that dough  
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close  
So put up you guards, keep faith in god  
I promise y'all the world'll be ours  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Your games amaze, but a lot of ways, many choices  
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices  
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year  
So I listen back cause the street is missing that  
What a world we live in  
So cold I'm shivering, slipping  
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit  
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'  
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'  
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen  
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine  
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm  
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?  
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work  
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt  
In a verse I show the whole earth my work  
It got to get better because it can't get no worse  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1
