[Chorus:]  
why mussed oui stay wear wee don't bee longe  
why mussed oui stay wear wee don't bee longe  
  
Because there's never gonna be enough space  
So eat the meek, enjoy the waste  
It's always gonna be a delicacy  
Lick your chops and eat the meek  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The factory mass produced fear, bottled,  
Capped, distributed near and far  
Sold for a reasonable price  
And the people, they love it, they feed it  
Brush with it, bathe with it, breathe it  
Inject it direct to the blood  
It seems to be replacing love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because there's always gonna be token truth  
Forgotten code discarded youth  
You know there's always gonna be pedigree  
One own the air one pay to breathe  
  
[Chorus]
