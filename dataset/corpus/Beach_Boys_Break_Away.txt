Break break shake away, break breakaway  
Now I'm free to do what I want to do  
  
Time will not wait for me, time is my destiny  
Why change the part of me that has to be free  
The love that passed me by, I found no reason why  
  
But now each day is filled with the love, that very same love  
That passed me by and that is why  
I can breakaway from that lonely life  
And I can do what I want to do  
And breakaway from that empty life and my world is new  
  
When I laid down on my bed I heard voices in my head  
Telling me now hey it's only a dream  
The more I thought of it I had been out of it  
And here's the answer I found instead  
(Baby baby) found out it was in my head (baby baby)  
(Baby baby) found out it was my head (baby baby)  
(Baby baby) found out it was in my head (baby baby)  
  
And I can breakaway to the better life  
Where the shackles never hold me down  
I'm gonna make a way for each happy day  
As my life turns around  
  
Come on we're free to breakaway (oh boy you jump for joy)  
Now won't you come on (when you breakaway)  
You're free to breakaways (breakaway)  
Come on you're free to breakaway (breakaway)  
Now won't you come on (breakaway)  
You're free to breakaways (breakaway)  
  
Feel the vibrations in all the sensations, breakaway  
Feel the vibrations in all the sensations, breakaway
