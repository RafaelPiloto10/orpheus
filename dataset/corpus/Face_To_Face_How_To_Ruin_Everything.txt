There's something wrong with me I don't know  
If it's not just inside my head  
It feels like I'm walking through a dream  
I still remember what you said  
I know that everything will be alright  
It's going to work out for the best  
I think there must be something better still  
It isn't really so far-fetched  
  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything  
  
It's hard to trust in somebody else  
Responsible for your success  
But in the end I know it's up to me  
I live my life with no regrets  
So tell me everything I want to hear  
What do you like about me best?  
I've been a king and I've been a fool  
I'm not about to give up yet  
  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything  
  
I've had enough of the promises  
I've had enough of empty threats  
Some people wait for opportunity  
Why should I wait? I haven't yet  
I want to burn down the prejudice  
I want to destroy the evidence  
Is all that really matters what you're worth?  
Then what is it worth for your two cents?  
  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything  
You know I'll go running out  
And ruin everything
