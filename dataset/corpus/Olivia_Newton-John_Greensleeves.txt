Alas, my love, you do me wrong  
To cast me off discourteously  
And I have loved you oh so long  
Delighting in your company  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy  
Greensleeves was my delight  
Greensleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves  
  
If you intend to be this way  
It does the more enrapture me  
And even so I still remain  
A lover in captivity  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy  
Greensleeves was my delight  
Greensleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves  
  
Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu  
God, I pray he will prosper thee  
For I am still thy lover true  
Come once again and love me  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy  
Greensleeves was my delight  
Greensleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves
