Well hello there gee it's been a long long time  
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems like it was only yesterday  
Ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love I hope that she's doin' fine  
Heard you told her that you'd love her till the end of time  
Now that's the same thing that you told me seems like just the other day  
Ain't it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now but I'll be seein' you around  
Don't know when though never know when I'll be back in town  
But remember what I told you that someday you're gonna pay  
And it's surprising how time slips away
