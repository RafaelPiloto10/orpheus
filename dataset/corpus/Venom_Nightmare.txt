By the shores of the aging sea  
Fools scream out destiny  
They speak of vengeance and your gods  
into the fire out of the flame  
The beast awakes thousands are slain  
The mystic reads forgotten tales  
All hallows hail your falling waves  
Nightmare this is your prize eternal  
Nightmare make no disguise infernal  
Nightmare you'll realize you lost in  
Nightmare, nightmare  
Inside explodes the butcher strikes  
You'd love to die your baby cries  
Lead candles burn just a decoy  
The giant child your his new toy  
In the eye of the lions teeth  
Your flesh becomes his meat  
You lie devoured still full of life  
Temples of ice white desert breeze  
The golden sun prepares to freeze  
Dying of thirst drowning in pain  
You wake in sleep it starts again
