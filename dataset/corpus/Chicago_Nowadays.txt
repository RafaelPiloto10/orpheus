Nowadays  
  
(Ladies and gentlemen, miss Roxie Hart says goodnight)  
  
It's good, isn't it grand, isn't it great  
Isn't it swell, isn't it fun, isn't it nowadays  
There's men, everywhere jazz, everywhere booze  
Everywhere life, everywhere joy, everywhere nowadays  
  
You can like the life you're living  
You can live the life your like  
You can even marry Harry  
But mess around with Ike  
  
And that's good, isn't it grand, isn't it great  
Isn't it swell, isn't it fun, isn't it... But nothings stays  
  
You can like the life you're living  
You can live the life your like  
You can even marry Harry  
But mess around with Ike  
  
And that's good, isn't it grand, isn't it great  
Isn't it swell, isn't it  
  
(that's great, we'll be in touch)
