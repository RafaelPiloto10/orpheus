No regret for the confidence betrayed  
No more hiding in shadow  
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid  
Time has come for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized  
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized  
  
They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them  
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm  
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom  
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em  
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden  
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em  
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'  
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!  
  
[Chorus]
