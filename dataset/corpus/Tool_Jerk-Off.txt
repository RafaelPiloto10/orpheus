Someone told me once  
That there's a right and wrong,  
And that punishment  
Would come to those  
Who dare to cross the line.  
  
But it must not be true  
For jerk-offs like you.  
Maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole.  
But I'm tired of waiting.  
Maybe it's just bullshit and I should play God,  
And shoot you myself.  
Because I'm tired of waiting.  
  
Consequences dictate  
Our course of action  
And it doesn't matter what's right.  
It's only wrong if you get caught.  
If consequences dictate  
My course of action  
I should play God  
And shoot you myself.  
I'm very tired of waiting.  
  
I should  
Kick you,  
Beat you,  
Fuck you,  
And then shoot you in your fucking head.
