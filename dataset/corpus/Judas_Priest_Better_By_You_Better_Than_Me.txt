You could find a way to ease my passion  
You listen to the blood flow in my veins  
You hear the teaching of the wind  
Tell her why I'm alive within  
I can't find the words  
My mind is dead  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried  
To speak up thoughts I've held so inside  
Tell her now I got to go  
Out in the streets and down the shore  
Tell her the world's not much living for  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can tell what I want it to be  
You can say what I only can see  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Guess I'll have to change my way of living  
Don't wanna really know the way I feel  
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill  
Tell her not to wait until  
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can say what I only can see  
You can tell what I want it to be  
  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can tell what I want it to be  
You can say way all they can see  
  
Better by you better than me
