When you look into a mirror tell me what do you see?  
Is it Pictures of Lily crying, you know what I mean?  
I've been livin' high, I've been livin' low  
Like a bird in the sky this is the way to go  
  
What you gonna do with those faded blues you wear?  
What you gonna do with those ol' rag blues?  
What you gonna do with those ol' blue jeans you wear?  
Ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues  
  
Did you think it was forever? Well now you know  
The summer sun keeps shining, shine through the blue  
I've been livin' high, I've been livin' low  
Never give up tryin', oh no, no, no  
  
What you gonna do with those faded blues you wear?  
What you gonna do with those ol' rag blues?  
What you gonna do with those ol' blue jeans you wear?  
Ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues  
  
I can hear you callin' somewhere in the blue  
Can you hear me callin' for you? For you?  
  
What you gonna do with those ol' blue jeans you wear?  
Ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues, ol' rag blues
