[Chorus 1]  
One more step to the top of the city  
Where just a couple of pigeons are living  
Up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 1]  
I don't know if I'm closer to Heaven but  
It looks like Hell down there  
These streets have never been paved with gold  
Welcome to the loneliest city in the world  
  
[Bridge 1]  
It's no good for you baby  
It's no good for you now  
Keep looking up for the ladder  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't know if you'll love me for it  
But I don't think we should suffer this  
There's just one thing we can do about it  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 3]  
See how that building there is nearly built  
There's a big fire over on the north of the city  
I see you walking down the street with her  
I see your lights going on and off  
  
[Bridge 2]  
She's no good for you baby  
She's no good for you now  
Look I'm here with the ladder  
  
[Verse 4]  
I don't know if you love me or not  
But I don't think we should ever suffer  
There's just one thing we can do about this  
  
[Chorus 4]  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Up to the highest point of the city  
One more step to the top of the city  
Put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 5]  
And I don't mind if it's dangerous  
I don't mind if it's raining  
Take me up to the top of the city  
  
[Chorus 5]  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Mmm yes, one more step to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders
