When I was young my father said  
'Son I have something to say'  
And what he told me I'll never forget  
Until my dying days  
  
[Chorus:]  
He said son you are a bachelor boy  
And that's the way to stay  
Son you'll be a bachelor boy  
Until your dying days  
  
When I was 16 I fell in love  
With a girl as sweet as can be  
But I remembered just in time  
What my daddy said to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As time goes by I probably will  
Meet a girl and fall in love  
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child  
And they'll be my turtle doves  
  
But until then I'll be a bachelor boy  
And that's the way I'll stay  
Happy to be a bachelor boy  
Until my dying days
