A.K.A. we don't play  
Fuck all night  
Smoke all day  
Claat AK  
Still DJ  
We play music we don't play  
  
When mi drop inna di scheme  
Ghetto limousine  
Mi rims a seventeen  
Mi and mi Mac II team  
Mi fresh mi never green  
Mi trees evergreen  
Mi badda dan Joshua Samson and di Phillistine  
When di sixpence clean  
Alarm go off but mi nuh si nuh response team  
Man dash weh dem license guns and clips and scream  
Reporter seh it no real a muss a sick man's dream  
But mi nuh response feeim  
Mi crime dem real dem don't play play  
Mi smoke my trees blen wid Craven "A"  
And what's my game it's war start well  
And what's my name it's Vybz Kartel  
  
A.K.A. we don't play  
Fuck all night  
Smoke all day  
Claat AK  
Still DJ  
We play music we don't play  
  
Rifle wid tripod handle boy bad  
While a go you sen yuh bab  
Tell mi suck mi Mom and Dad  
Now you deh pon "Jesus Christ oh my God"  
Boy a run  
Cell Block bruk him back like a crab  
A nuh Bush, a we drop bombs over Bagdhad  
Weh day mi could a get a gun from mi Grandad  
When him seh "hold dis mi son"  
Mi seh "Pappy mi nuh fire people gun"  
Him seh "weh yuh claim"  
Mi seh "you nuh hear mi name"  
  
A.K.A. we don't play  
Fuck all night  
Smoke all day  
Claat AK  
Still DJ  
We play music we don't play
