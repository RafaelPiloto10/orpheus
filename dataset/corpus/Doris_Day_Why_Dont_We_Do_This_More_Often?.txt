Why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Gee, but it's great to get together again  
Why does it only happen now and then  
We oughtta do this more often  
Don't you agree that I'm right  
We make each other laugh  
We make each other sing  
And you can never ever  
Over-do a good thing  
So why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Oh gee, but it's great to get together again  
Why does it only happen now and then  
We oughtta do it more often  
Don't you agree that I'm right  
We make each other laugh  
We make each other sing  
And you can never ever  
Overdo a good thing  
Why don't we do it more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight
