(clarke)  
Lucy you're a floozy  
You ain't choosy  
You've been flashing those big blue eyes  
At the other guys  
Don't be surprised  
If you don't end up with a  
Baby cool it, don't over do it  
Always have something left as your standby  
Lucy baby keep me in mind  
You're so reckless  
A diamond necklace  
Ain't no substitute for how you feel  
Such a steal  
Lucy baby let's make it real  
Red light outa sight is what you're saying  
You don't really think that's true  
No help needed you're displaying  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind  
As the queen bee I'll make your honey  
I'll even populate your hive  
I've got a sting that ain't so funny  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind  
Can I try you  
Let me buy you  
Just a piece of my delight  
For the night  
You'll find it alright  
Lucy baby keep me in mind  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind  
Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind
