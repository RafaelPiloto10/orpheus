Like a locomotive wheel  
Feelings real as steel  
Hearts are just bound to break  
Well, I'm off and on my way  
Rolling night and day  
Highway's callin' my name  
  
You know sometimes  
Maybe always  
You know sometimes  
I'll be there  
  
Well, I wish that I could say  
Wish I could stay  
But now April's turning to May  
If you see me in a while  
Thank you for that smile  
Talking 'bout an old friend  
  
You know sometimes  
Maybe always  
You know sometimes  
I'll be there  
  
Like a locomotive wheel  
Feelings real as steel  
Hearts are just bound to break  
Well, I'm off and on my way  
Rolling night and day  
Highway's callin' my name  
When you hear this highway song  
I guess that's where it's goin'  
Talking 'bout an old friend  
  
You know sometimes  
Almost always  
You know sometimes  
I'll be there  
  
You know sometimes  
Maybe always  
You know always  
I'll be there
