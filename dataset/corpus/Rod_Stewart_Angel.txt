Angel came down from heaven yesterday  
Stayed with me long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday  
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea  
Then she spread her wings high over me  
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side  
  
Fly away, high away, fly away  
  
Sure enough this morning came unto me  
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise  
And my angel she said unto me  
Today's the day for you to rise  
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise  
Then she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side  
  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side  
  
Fly away, come back another day
