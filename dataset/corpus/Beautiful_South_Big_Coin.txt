Big coin that you toss for heads or tails  
Big coin that you let slip down the drain  
Big coin didn't find where it landed  
Big coin, big coin  
  
Big coin that you dropped in the river  
Little raft that took you across  
Little hand that pulled it from the gutter  
Big coin, big coin  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no beat or no breath  
Big coin won't even leave you a love note  
Big coin, big death  
  
Big coin that you held and you treasured  
Big coin that you can't believe that you lost  
Little kiss that helped you when you needed  
Little kiss, big coin  
  
Little heart that has no exchange rate  
Big coin that could join the IMF  
Little heart is only the greedy 'cause it's poor  
Little heart, big coin  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no north or no south  
Big coin says it will never ever leave you  
Big coin, big mouth  
  
Little heart,  
it ain't gold, it ain't silver  
Little heart,  
it ain't wasted on me  
Little heart,  
so much bigger than the coin  
Little heart,  
big guarantee  
Little heart,  
big guarantee  
  
Little heart...  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no north or no south  
Big coin says it will never ever leave you  
Big coin, big mouth
