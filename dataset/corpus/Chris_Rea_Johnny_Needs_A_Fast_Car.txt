Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs it bad  
Johnny always do the best  
Whatever johnny has  
Johnny needs a fast one  
Johnny needs it now  
You got to give him something to  
Let him show you how  
Johnny needs a fast car  
  
Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs a break  
Johnny don't need good luck  
'cause johnny never fakes  
He'll always make it look good  
You'll always see him smile  
Give johnny a few inches  
And he'll give you back a mile  
  
Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs a fast car  
  
Tears upon the broken bones  
Of luck that never went his way  
Bless this one you'll know him by his smile
