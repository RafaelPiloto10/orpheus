All day I face  
The barren waste  
Without the taste  
Of water.  
Cool Water.  
  
Dan and I,  
With throats burned dry  
And souls that cry  
For water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
The nights are cool,  
And I'm a fool.  
Each stars a pool  
Of water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
And with the dawn  
I'll wake and yawn  
And carry on  
To water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
The Shadows sway  
And seem to say,  
"Tonight we pray  
For water."  
Cool, clear water.  
  
And way up there  
He'll hear our prayer  
And show us where  
There's water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Keep moving Dan.  
Don't you listen to him Dan.  
He's the devil not a man.  
He spreads the burning sands  
With Water.  
  
Say, Dan can't you see  
That big green tree  
Where the water's running free?  
It's waiting there for you and me.  
  
And water  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Dan's feet are sore.  
He's yearning for  
Just one thing more  
Than water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Like me I guess  
He'd like to rest  
Where there's no quest  
For water.  
Cool, clear water.
