Turn up the bass, turn up the treble,  
I'm about to take you to a whole other level!  
Dj turn off what you're playing,  
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying!  
Because this girl means too much to me,  
And now we're on the floor and she's touching me.  
And if I wanna take her home  
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio!  
  
It's gotta be the crunkest  
It's gotta be the loudest!  
It's gotta be the best song she ever heard!  
I gotta tell her how I feel,  
I gotta let her hear, the best song she ever heard!  
Don't need for me to write it  
I just gotta picture her smiling,  
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby!  
And now we've got the whole stadium in love!  
  
Turn up the lights, give me a mic  
I'm about to sing and do it just as she likes.  
Jump of the stage, crowd surfing all the way  
You know it's right, just do the wave  
Girl just move your body like a snake!  
And if you wanna get with me,  
Put your hands in the air show me that energy  
  
It's gotta be the crunkest  
It's gotta be the loudest!  
It's gotta be the best song she ever heard!  
I gotta tell her how I feel,  
I gotta let her hear, the best song she ever heard!  
Don't need for me to write it  
I just gotta picture her smiling,  
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby!  
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh...  
  
Homie kiss your girl!  
Shwaty kiss your man!  
We can see you on the kissing  
Now show me some love!  
Show me some love!  
Now look her in the eye, see baby I love you,  
I never put no one above you!  
And if you feel that way,  
Go ahead and kiss your baby!  
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh... !  
And if you feel that way,  
Go ahead and kiss your baby!  
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh... !  
Eh, eh, eh, eh!  
Oh, oh, oh!
