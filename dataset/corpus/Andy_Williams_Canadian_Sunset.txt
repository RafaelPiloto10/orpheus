Once I was alone  
So lonely and then  
You came, out of nowhere  
Like the sun up from the hills  
  
Cold, cold was the wind  
Warm, warm were your lips  
Out there, on that ski trail  
Where your kiss filled me with thrills  
  
A weekend in Canada, a change of scene  
Was the most I bargained for  
And then I discovered you and in your eyes  
I found the love that I couldn't ignore  
  
Down, down came the sun  
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart  
I knew when the sun set  
From that day, we'd never ever part
