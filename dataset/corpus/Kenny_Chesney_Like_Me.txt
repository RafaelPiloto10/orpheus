Drivin' down the road again  
A highway that never ends  
Takin' naps in my old car  
Singin' in guitar bars  
Killin' time with cafe queens  
And truckers playin' slot machines  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Charlie runs the Produce Shack  
Livin' in a van out back  
Sellin' peas and homemade syrup  
Cantaloupes and Elvis shirts  
Braggin' on future plans  
With whiskey breath and shaky hands  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes  
To another one-night show  
'Cause that's where I was born to be  
Have guitar, will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin' this lifetime lottery  
  
Here's to faces I have seen  
A carnival of those who dream  
Rodeos seekin' fame  
Table dancers I can't name  
Willie T. in Abilene  
Karaoke's all-time king  
And every six string wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes  
To another one-night show  
'Cause that's where I was born to be  
Have guitar, will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin' this lifetime lottery  
  
To every dreamer I have known  
May Lady Luck take you home  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free ... like me  
  
Livin' free like me  
Livin' free like me  
Livin' free like me
