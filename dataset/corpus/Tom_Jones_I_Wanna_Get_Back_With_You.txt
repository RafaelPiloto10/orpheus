I was a fool to say the things I said,  
I just lost my head.  
Made you cry, made you go,  
I didn't mean to be so cold.  
I had no right mistreating you that way  
And oh, how could I know the price I'd pay?  
Sorry I ever caused you pain.  
Sorry I, sorry I said those hurtful things.  
But baby, all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you.  
Just give me one more try.  
I wanna get back with you.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Just stop this hurt inside.  
I been losing sleep  
I been walking down these cold and lonely streets.  
Had to prove I was strong but every night,  
Every night just proved me wrong.  
Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand  
And oh, just let it slip away like sand.  
One more chance, one more chance back in your light.  
Oh, gimme one chance to make it right.  
I wanna get back with you.  
'Cause baby, all that really matters now is  
Hold me just like before.  
I wanna get back with you.  
Taking me somewhere warm.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Baby, I'd give my soul  
Just to hold one more time,  
'Cause right now I'm half alive  
Just to look in your eyes.  
There's no living without you,  
No matter what I do  
Can't you see baby?  
I wanna get back with you.  
Just give me one more try.  
I wanna get back with you.  
Hold me just like before.  
Just stop this hurt inside.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Taking me somewhere warm.  
I wanna get back with you, baby.  
I wanna get back with you, babe.  
I gotta get back with you!  
I wanna get back!  
Oh, take me back
