Oh my, this beat in my heart  
Just in the dark but you're lightning my eyes  
Said I watch you ignite in fire  
And you got a power  
You're damn right  
This life I did  
Not gonna make it if you don't connect tonight right  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
Now I need it in somewhere  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
Glow as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Love won't die  
So what you're giving me girl  
That energy giving  
You know how it goes sometimes  
Love won't die  
Love won't die  
But if you need it girl  
I got energy come and get it  
Sometimes I need to give a little  
Get a little, forget a little  
We could meet any place  
I... You got the power  
Baby you know if you ever go  
And you're back into the light  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
And I've been needing it so bad  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady
