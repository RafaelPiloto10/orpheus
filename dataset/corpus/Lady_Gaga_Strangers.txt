I see one thing coming at me  
I'm the little girl and you and your friends are the strangers  
You take me away to nowhere anyone else will find us  
We hide we deny all the things we've done to one another  
Going crazy over you  
You're an alien in disguise  
So extraterrestrial  
I'm a hooker  
You work for the government  
  
I'm so proud of you you sexual creature  
Hooker  
We're gonna drink until we die  
We'll die together  
We're sexual lovers  
Fuck everything else  
I'll fuck you all fucking night  
I bet I can make you yell until your fucking lungs burst  
You'll never be unusual to me  
I may not like your friends but they still aren't strangers  
Strangers strangers hooker  
  
Loving calling to my gay friends  
They're fucked up bad  
We're bad bad bad bad  
You may be transgendered but I still love you  
A transgendered alien  
So impossible  
No alien birth  
I met you  
Love at first sight  
Transgendered alien birth  
I tell you I'm not kidding  
I never kid around baby  
  
I'm so proud of you you sexual creature  
Hooker we're gonna drink until we die  
We'll die together  
We're sexual lovers  
Fuck everything else  
I'll fuck you all fucking night  
I bet I can make you yell until your fucking lungs burst  
You'll never be unusual to me  
I may not like your friends  
But they still aren't strangers  
Strangers strangers hooker  
  
Hookers alien birth bisexuality  
Hookers alien birth bisexuality  
Too many times if I told you  
  
I'm so proud of you you sexual creature  
Hooker we're gonna drink until we die  
We'll die together  
We're sexual lovers  
Fuck everything else  
I'll fuck you all fucking night  
I bet I can make you yell until your fucking lungs burst  
You'll never be unusual to me  
I may not like your friends  
But they still aren't strangers
