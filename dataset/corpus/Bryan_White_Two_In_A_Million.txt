In a world of illusion  
Filled with wrong turns  
Where so many bridges  
Seem destined to burn  
The odds are so great  
The chances so slim  
To find the right her  
For just the right him  
  
We're two in a million, exceptions to the rule  
I followed my heart and love led me to you  
It's a gamble at best, so easy to lose  
But the first time we kissed we both knew  
We're two in a million  
Two who found one love that's true  
  
What some call love  
Can be lost overnight  
And they find there's a tunnel  
At the end of the light  
But here in your arms  
The only surprise  
Is the way love keeps growing  
As time passes by
