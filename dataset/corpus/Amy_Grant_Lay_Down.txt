It's a cold, cold world  
That we're walking through.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
But it's warm as toast  
Walking two by two,  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
It's a fine, fine line  
Betwixt love and hate.  
Why, it's tough to tell the two apart.  
But you know it's love  
That He offers you.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.
