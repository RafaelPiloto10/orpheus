I grew up in a typical way  
So I keep trying to unwind  
Cause I'm agitated  
  
In this place so full of hate  
I keep trying to unwind  
You might think it's pretty obvious  
So tell me what I say, hey!  
I way born in a typical way  
So I keep trying to go back  
And I'm agitated  
  
In this world so full of pain  
I keep trying to go back  
You might think its pretty infantile  
So tell me what I know, hey!  
Day and night forever trading places  
Good and evil sleeping side by side  
In this world full of plenty of stuff  
You'd think there'd be enough love to go around, hey!  
I was picked in a random way  
To be a singing dancing fool  
And I'm agitated  
  
In this place going less than great  
I', just a singing dancing fool  
If you don't like what I keep talking about  
Then tell me what I say, hey!  
I'm agitated  
  
If you think you got it all worked out  
Then tell me what to know, ho!  
I'm agitated  
  
Tell me what I say  
Do the mashed potatoes  
Tell me what I say  
I'm feeling amputated  
Educated  
I'm agitated
