On days like this we would linger by the ocean  
Then we would dream as we lay there side by side  
I don't know why but one day you got the notion  
To sit and watch for the changing of the tide  
And then he came just to ask a foolish question  
But jealousy in my heart I could not hide  
Though I don't believe it was really your intention  
In your eyes I saw the changing of the tide  
Now you're gone from me all you left to me is the restless sea to keep me
company  
Now I'm here alone where we used to be together  
I can't forget guess I never really try  
Fool that I am I'll go on and on forever just watching for the changing of the
tide
