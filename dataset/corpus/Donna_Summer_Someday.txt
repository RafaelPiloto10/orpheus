Someday  
When we are wiser  
When the world's older  
When we have learned  
  
I pray  
Someday we may yet live  
To live and let live  
Someday  
  
Life will be fairer  
Need will be rarer  
And greed will not pay  
God speed  
  
This bright millennium  
On it's way  
Let it come  
Someday  
  
Someday  
Our fight will be won then  
We'll stand in the sun then  
'Til then  
  
On days when the sun is gone  
We'll hang on  
Wish upon the moon  
There are some days dark and bitter  
  
Seems we haven't got a prayer  
But a prayer for someday better  
Is the one thing we all share  
Someday  
Someday soon
