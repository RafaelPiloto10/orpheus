you haven't heard a word of what i said i'd give anything to get inside your
head you act as if there's nothing left to say i guess everything is easier
that way i know that you don't want to think about it anyway i won't let you
hide from this even with your best defense you can't deny the way you feel
about me i know you think about it all of time but there's nothing left to
make you change your mind i know you think you're doing what is right but
you're acting on frustration out of spite and i don't want to say another word
to start a fight and if you're so convinced that we're so wrong you're still
standing here where you've been all along it doesn't make much difference
where we think that we belong
