I stood and saw the judge's gavel fall  
And much to my dismay these words I've heard him say  
I've listened to your story boy and it seems to me  
You'd be better off if you'll set her free  
But I love her I love her down on my knees I cry  
And I don't want to lose her heaven knows I try  
To make her happy but she wants more than me  
And I'll take her like she is before I'll set her free  
[ steel ]  
Judge I know she loves me in her own kind of way  
Even though she hurts me a hundred times a day  
You tell me that it's better that I should set her free  
But judge what would you do if you were me  
You see I love her I love her in spite of all she's done  
And I'll keep right on hoping someday that time will come  
When she'll decide that she wants only me  
And I'll take her like she is before I'll set her free
