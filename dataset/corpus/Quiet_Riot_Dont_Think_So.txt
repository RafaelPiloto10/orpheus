[Verse 1:]  
You sucked religion from my life  
When we met I believed you were hell  
Take the knife from my back  
I know you? Ll use it again  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
You don? T give  
You just take  
You don? T give  
You just break  
  
[Verse 2:]  
We were never friends  
A one act play  
I had to stop pretending  
My heart don? T ache since you? Ve been gone  
It? S like you never left  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
You don? T give  
You just take  
You don? T give  
You just take  
  
[Bridge:]  
My time and my money but money ain? T love no  
The evil within shines without a light  
I know what I see and I mean what I say
