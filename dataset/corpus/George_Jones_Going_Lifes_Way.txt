When the journey toilsome grows  
Many's the conflict cares and woes  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
How we long for peace and love  
Home in the Father's house above  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
Sweet the thought that cares will cease  
Over the times our joys increase  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
On the way we'll rather sing  
Praises to Christ our Lord and King  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
Though the dark way rugged might be  
It's his own hands guiding we seek  
Leading us too that mansion above  
Where there is joy, joy, joy, rapture and love.  
  
Jesus leads all shepherds, friends  
All of his own He will defend  
Going life's way, going life's way.  
  
Never will our Lord forsake  
Us till in life we shall awake  
Ending life's way, going life's way.  
  
Though the dark way rugged might be  
It's his own hands keeps a-guiding we seek  
Leading us too that mansion above  
Where there is joy, joy, joy, rapture and love
