Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
And I pray  
  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Knowing that things ain't right  
Its in the papers, its on the TV,  
Its everywhere that I go  
Children are crying  
Soldiers are dying  
Some people don't have a home  
  
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Can you tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
  
I lose my appetite,  
Knowing kids starve tonight  
Am I a sinner,  
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate  
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference  
And its starting today  
  
'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Heaven tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and  
Pray for the broken-hearted  
I pray for the life not started  
I pray for all the lungs not breathing  
I pray for all the souls in need  
I pray  
Can you give 'em one today  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Can someone tell how to make a change?  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and I pray  
  
I pray  
I pray  
I pray  
I close my eyes and pray
