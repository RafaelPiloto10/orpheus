[Chorus]  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change, come what may  
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
Guess I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good  
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter, not enough for you to do  
And those winds sure do blow cold way up there  
  
[Chorus]
