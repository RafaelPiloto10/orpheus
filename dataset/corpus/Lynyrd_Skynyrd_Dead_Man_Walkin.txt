Outside of Macon off a country road  
Justice was forsaken when they let the wrong man go  
Johnny Law was shady first one on the scene  
They called it murder in the first degree  
  
Dead man walkin', walkin' down the hall  
Judge says guilty but still he's standin' tall  
Dead man walkin' they say he broke the law  
Takin' the life of another man who done his daughter wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Light 'em up, lay 'em down  
Take 'em out but there's more of us around  
When wrong is right and right is wrong  
Oh there's a dead man walkin' tonight  
  
Walk on [Repeat: x3]  
  
If I ask you a question, would you tell the truth  
Would you pull the trigger if you were standin' in his shoes  
Dead man walkin' I know what I'd do  
If someone hurt my baby I'd be walkin' too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah,  
So if I ask you that question, would you tell the truth?  
Dead man walkin'
