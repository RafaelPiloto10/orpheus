Take Me  
  
Come and dance with me, take me all the higher.  
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter.  
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music.  
Come make love with me ...  
  
Oh ...  
CHORUS  
Come on, take me, take me, and make me feel your music.  
want to get in deep when it tastes so sweet,  
want to lose my head tonight.  
Come on, take me, take me, make me feel your music.  
Well we ain't gonna stop if we're feelin' hot,  
Gotta' lose our heads tonight.  
  
How many times I tried to make it happen?  
But you always find a way to say good-night.  
Tonight we're here alone, your mama's out, there's nobody home,  
I'm a harmless kinda crazy so it's alright.  
  
CHORUS  
  
I've seen you give me looks that I've read about in books,  
And I finally had to make you play your hand.  
There's a reason that you're here, and I think it's perfectly clear.  
But it don't take much to make me understand.  
  
Come and dance with me, take me all the higher.  
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter.  
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music.  
Come make love with me, come make love, make love with me.  
  
Oh ...  
CHORUS  
  
CHORUS  
(to fade)
