Tar and feathers hide your feelings  
If you even know the meaning  
Your high road is overrated  
You left your guru out there hangin'  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
Your appetite's insatiable  
Devouring one thousand souls  
It's more or less the same ol' story  
The princess and the whore, the lady  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody sees it (nobody sees it)  
Nobody hears it (nobody hears it)  
Nobody breathin' in a coma  
So keep your secret (so keep your secret)  
Your perfect secrets (your little secrets)  
It's just a game, but no one's playin'  
  
In a coma lying, waiting  
Desire fills the lonely craving  
So many trampled-under footwear  
But more to fill the trophy cases  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
[Chorus: x2]
