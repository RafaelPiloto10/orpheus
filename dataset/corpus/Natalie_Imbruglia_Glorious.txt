Walking down the Frith Street  
Dawn is creeping up on me  
Some girls tears in a taxi  
Five o'clock shadows, drinking coffee  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels, now I'm finally smiling on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, it'll never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, and it's all I see  
On a day like this you know it's meant to be  
Now I've got nothing to find  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
And it's glorious  
  
Drinking wine back in my house  
Remember someone said your name  
I somehow lost the conversation  
I've fallen a million miles away  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels when you're finally walking on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, it'll never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, yeah it's all I see  
On a day like this you know it's meant to be  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
  
Keep wanting a little, a little more  
Keep walking, keep walking  
Keep getting a little, a little more  
Keep running, keep running  
  
Ooh, walking down the Frith Street  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, will never, never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, and it's all I see  
On a day like this I know it's meant to be  
Cause I've got nothing to find  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
And it's glorious
