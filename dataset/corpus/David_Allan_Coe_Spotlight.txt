I can't see nothing but spotlights spotlights see nothing but me  
All of my music is lonely yeah all of my heartaches were free  
Don't waste your time or your flash bulbs too many heroes are dead  
You like to live in the city yeah I like to live in my head  
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive  
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive  
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry  
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lie  
  
I spend my nighttime's in mourning I spend my morning's alone  
You spent your your money to see me tonight yeah I spent all mine gettin'
stoned  
Now that they're both kinda busted doesn't it seem kinda strange  
That I lay down knowing we're two of a kind you'll leave here knowing my name  
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive  
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive  
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry  
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lie
