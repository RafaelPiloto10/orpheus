I've got a nightmare to remember  
I'll never be the same.  
What began as laughter  
So soon would turn to pain.  
  
The sky was clear and frigid  
The air was thick and still  
Now I'm not one to soon forget  
And I bet I never will  
  
Picture for a moment  
The perfect irony  
A flawless new beginning  
Eclipsed by tragedy.  
  
The uninvited stranger  
Started dancing on his own  
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride  
And we made our way back home.  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
Father and mother  
Holding each other.  
(Chug chug chug chug)  
  
Without warning  
Out of nowhere  
Like a bullet  
From the night  
  
Crushing glass  
Rubber and steel  
Scorching fire  
Glowing lights  
  
Screams of terror  
Pain of fear  
Sounds of sirens  
Smoke in my eyes  
  
Sudden stillness  
Wrapped in silence  
No more screaming  
No more cries  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Lying on the table  
In this unfamiliar place  
I'm greeted by a stranger  
A man without a face  
  
He said, "Son do you remember?  
Do you even know your name?"  
Then he shined a light into my eyes  
And said, "take this for the pain."  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
"Tell me does this hurt you?"  
Said the faceless man.  
"Can you move all of your fingers?  
Can you try your best to stand?"  
  
I asked about the others  
"Is everyone okay?"  
He told me not to worry  
As he turned and looked away.  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
Day after day  
And night after night  
We burden the oppressed  
Did they ever see the red light?  
  
Over and over  
Scene by scene  
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.  
How could you prepare  
  
For what would happen next?  
The search you'll never have to see  
Hi father such a mess.  
It's a miracle he lived  
  
It's a blessing no one died  
By the grace of God above  
Everyone survived  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
It will stay with us forever  
A nightmare to remember
