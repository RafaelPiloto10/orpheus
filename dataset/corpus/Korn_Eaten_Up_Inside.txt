I'll die smiling  
Something the past  
Someone says to me will make me laugh  
And I'll lay back and fade away  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me go, I'll be fine  
Frozen here in time  
Sick of being alive  
Eaten up inside  
Let me die, go away  
I never got what I wanted, I never got what I needed  
What's on my mind?  
Who can say?  
It's my invention I'm beating  
I cannot stop all this bleeding  
  
I'll be ready  
Give me the morphine and I'll go to sleep  
As I dream, maybe I will just slide away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eaten up inside  
Let me die, go away  
I never got what I wanted, I never got what I needed  
What's on my mind?  
Who can say?  
It's my infection I'm feeding  
I cannot stop all this bleeding  
  
(Eaten, eaten, inside)  
(Eaten, eaten, inside)  
(Eaten, eaten, inside)  
(Eaten, eaten, inside)  
  
Eaten up inside
