Oh what a night!  
Late December back in sixty-three.  
What a very special time for me.  
I'll remember what a night.  
  
Oh what a night!  
No I didn't even know her name,  
But I'm never gonna be the same.  
What a lady, what a night!  
  
Oh I, I had a funny feeling when she walked into the room.  
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon.  
Oh what a night!  
  
Hypnotized and mesmorizing me.  
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surender, what a night!  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under,  
Oh what a night!  
  
Why'd it take so long to see the light.  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seemed so right.  
What a lady, what a night!
