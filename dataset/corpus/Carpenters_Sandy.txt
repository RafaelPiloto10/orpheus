Looking at you  
I'm almost home again  
Something in you  
Puts me at ease  
Yes, I know that you're  
Suspicious of me  
Do I mean the things I say?  
You know I've been in love before  
That much is true  
But though I've been in love before  
It wasn't with you  
  
Ooh, Sandy  
Could we spend the day together  
You know how rainy weather  
Gets me down when I'm alone  
You, Sandy  
You gotta be a friend today  
An hour with you would  
Chase the winter away  
  
Being with you  
I'm like a child again  
Your eyes can see  
Clearer than mine  
No one ever made me quite so aware  
No one ever took the time  
The time it took surprises me  
Nothing's the same  
As if my life began again  
Hearing your name  
  
Ooh, Sandy  
Could we spend the day together?  
You know how rainy weather  
Gets me down when I'm alone  
You, Sandy  
You gotta be a friend today  
An hour with you would  
Chase the winter away
