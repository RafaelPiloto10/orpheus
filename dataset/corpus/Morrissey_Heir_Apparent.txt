I came back to my old city  
With fierce determination  
And I couldn't find my way out of the station  
  
It's all changed  
You were there  
Departing, starting  
A trek I had once took  
With that "no-one's gonna stop me when I feel this way" look  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
I fell down in my old city  
Such sad degradation  
So I tried to make my way back to the station  
  
You were still there  
Gleaming and leaving  
Wide-eyed and awestruck  
Saying "How can anybody hate me  
If I love them first off ?"  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
But you may be OK, I don't know  
  
I'll see you back here  
In a few bruised years  
Pray  
I'll see you here  
I'll see you here  
I'll see you here  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You say that you want it, I'm sure that you'll get it  
They'll seduce your heart and then they'll slap your arse  
  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir
