He needs a quiet room  
With a lock to keep him  
In its just a quiet room  
And he's there  
He plays an old guitar  
With a coin found by the phone  
It was his friends guitar  
That he played  
Hm mm mm  
  
He's never been in love  
But he knows just what love is  
He says never mind  
And no one speaks  
  
He thinks he drinks too much  
Cause when he tells his two best friends  
I think I drink too much  
  
No one speaks  
No one speaks  
No one speaks  
Hm hm mm mm mm hm hm mm  
  
He plays an old guitar  
With a coin found by the phone  
It was his friends guitar  
  
That he played  
When he plays  
No one speaks  
No one speaks  
And he plays  
No one speaks
