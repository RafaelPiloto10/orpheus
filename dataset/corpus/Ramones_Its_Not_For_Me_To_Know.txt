Easy come and easy go for me that was the fun  
It was something that I didn't think was so bad  
Now I'm lookin' out my window but I don't know where I am  
And I've give up trying to understand what I can't  
  
I don't have any illusions anymore I've done all that I can do  
  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
  
I stood under the moonlight to ill-luminate myself  
Something I fell into from being kicked around  
  
I don't have any illusions anymore I've done all that I can do  
  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
  
No one seemed to notice seeing from smoke screen eyes  
  
You can get what you want but I don't think it is true  
  
I don't have any illusions anymore I've done all that I can do  
  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know  
  
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know
