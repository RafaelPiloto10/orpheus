I'm cold  
I'm cold  
I'm cold  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I got the right to put up a fight  
But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
I got my life and its my only one  
I got the night, I'm running from the sun  
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)  
After tonight, there will be no return  
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road  
I'm taking off on the road  
  
And that you know (that you know)  
Tell every one that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)  
  
Okay I'm back up on my grind  
You do you and I'm just gone do mine  
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine  
Okay I got you out my mind  
The night is young, the drinks is cold  
The stars is out, I'm ready to go  
You always thought I was always wrong  
Well know you know,  
Tell everybody everybody that you know!  
Tell everybody that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know  
That you know  
  
I got the right to put up a fight  
But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
Baby girl I'm finished!  
I thought we were committed  
I thought we were cemented  
I really thought we meant it  
But now we just repentin'  
And now we just resentin'  
The clouds is in my vision  
Look how high I be gettin'  
And its all because of you  
Girl we through  
You think your shit don't stink,  
But you are Mrs. p-u  
And I don't see you with me no more  
Now tell everybody that you know  
That you know!  
  
That you know  
Tell everybody that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know  
That you know  
That you know  
Tell everyone that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know  
That you know
