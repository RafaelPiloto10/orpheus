Can't stand  
The way you look  
The way you talk  
The way you act  
Can't stand you  
  
Do I think  
You're a dick  
Yeah  
You're a fuck  
Yeah  
We'll fight  
Yeah  
  
Do I think you'll win  
No  
  
Do I think you're stupid  
Yeah  
Do I think you're lame  
Yeah  
Am I stressing  
You're the one to blame  
  
I open my mouth at the wrong time  
Always ranking on somebody  
I'm drunk all the time  
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face  
Checking through the purse  
Of the slut in our place  
  
She'll never notice if her money is gone  
Piss in her jacket  
And just send her along
