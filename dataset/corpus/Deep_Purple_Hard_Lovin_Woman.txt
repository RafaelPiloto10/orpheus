She walked into the room  
Her hand upon her hip  
Said 'look out boy  
I'll make your backbone slip'  
She looked straight at me  
The devil in her eye  
I knew what I was getting but took it by surprise  
No fooling, she really knocked the stuffing out of me  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman  
She chewed me up and spat me out  
  
Some woman  
She's a hard lovin' woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman  
  
She didn't wear nothing  
But a smile upon her face  
Licking her lips but I had the taste  
Her temperature was rising  
I was coming to the boil  
Her fires were burning  
She was pouring on the oil  
I do not jest, she really took me to the cleaners  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman  
It felt just great when she pulled her 38s  
  
Some woman  
She's a hard lovin' woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman  
  
It started with a smile  
It turned into a laugh  
It ended with a scream  
I said 'enough's enough'  
Never heard a word  
She wouldn't let go  
A man's a man and every woman ought to know  
And there I was  
And she was dancing  
Some woman  
Here we go again  
  
Some woman  
She's a hard lovin' woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman
