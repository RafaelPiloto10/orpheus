Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't  
What do I find?  
The things I got will keep me satisfied  
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't  
What do I find?  
A healthy balance on the credit side  
Got no diamond  
Got no pearl  
Still I think I'm a lucky girl  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
I'm all right

Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no silver  
Got no gold  
What I got can't be bought or sold  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
I'm all right  
[3]  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no heirlooms  
For my kin  
Made no will but when I cash in  
I leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening they're all right
