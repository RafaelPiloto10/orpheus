I am timid  
And I am oversensitive  
I am a lioness  
I am tired and defensive  
You take me in your arms  
And I fold into you  
I have insecurities  
You show me I am beautiful  
  
Love me or leave me just take it or leave it  
It's not that I'm needy just need you to see me  
Take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
I am temperamental  
And I have imperfections  
And I am emotional  
I am unpredictable  
I am naked  
I am vulnerable  
I am a woman  
I am opening up to you  
  
Love me or leave me, just take it or leave it  
It's not that I'm needy, just need you to see me  
Take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
Now I stand before you with my heart in my hands  
I'm asking you to take me just the way that I am  
  
Please lay down your arms  
Do you know me?  
Make me feel safe from harm  
  
Oh just take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
I am temperamental  
And I have imperfections  
And I am emotional  
There'll be no more pretending
