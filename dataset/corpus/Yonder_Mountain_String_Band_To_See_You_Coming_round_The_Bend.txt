To see you coming 'round the bend  
I just can't think of anything that could make me smile like you can  
When you're coming 'round the bend, noooo  
  
I've been in love a time or two before  
And all of that experience allows me to be sure  
That you're the one  
Sure as darkness brings the rising sun  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
We both share the trials of the road  
Cursing all the miles and the nights we spend alone  
But then I smile  
You've been waiting for me all the while  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
I know the sun could hide behind the clouds for days  
And I've walked down crowded streets and never seen a smiling face  
And times like those, I'll just close my eyes and picture when  
  
[ Chorus - "I'll see you coming..." ]
