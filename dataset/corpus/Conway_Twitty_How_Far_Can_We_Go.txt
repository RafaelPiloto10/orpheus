Oh how far can we go you and me doin' this  
We're doin' the things that only sinners do but I can't keep my mind off of
you  
We made a mistake one night and didn't quit  
So how far can we go you and me doin' this  
We're strangers by day and lovers by night  
And I feel like a thief when I hold you tight  
The ring on my finger shows that I'm still his  
So how far can we go you and me doin' this  
Lovin' like there's no tomorrow or past we're takin' the backroad go and go
out fast  
The ring on my finger shows that I'm still his  
So how far can we go you and me doin' this  
So how far can we go you and me me and you everyday all the time doin' this
