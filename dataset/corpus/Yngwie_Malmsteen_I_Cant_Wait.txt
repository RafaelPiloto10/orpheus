On and on  
My world keeps spinnin' round and round  
I am so lost since you've gone away  
[Chorus 1:]  
Day after day I've been tryin'  
To find a way to make you see  
[Chorus 2:]  
I - hate to wonder  
Why - you don't realize  
I - feel like I could die  
Just hold me one more time  
I can't wait - not for a lifetime  
I can't wait - I've been holding on  
I can't wait - Tell me what to do  
I'll wait for you  
Ooh, it's been so long  
I won't last another day  
[Chorus 1
