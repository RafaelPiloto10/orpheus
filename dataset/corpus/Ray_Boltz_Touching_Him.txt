A woman came to Simon's house,  
She knew the Lord was there,  
For when she walked into the room  
She was greeted by a stare,  
She surely must have shocked a few  
Of the people gathered there,  
As with tear-filled eyes  
And trembling hands  
She took down her long dark hair,  
And from an alabaster vessel  
Precious ointment filled her hair,  
As she wept she kissed his feet  
And began anointing them.  
Chorus  
With her hands, she was touching him,  
The alpha the omega,  
The beginning and the end,  
And with her hands  
She was holding on to His,  
The source of life  
Was right there in her hands.  
Now Simon said within his heart,  
Lord if you only knew the kind of woman  
That's touching you,  
But Jesus knew about her past,  
He knew about the sin,  
Yet He saw in her a repentant heart  
That had come to worship Him.  
Chorus  
Now tell me why do we gather  
Together in His name,  
Are we like the ones who merely watched,  
Tell me is that why we came,  
Are we like this sister,  
Do we truly enter in,  
In spirit and in truth,  
Have you come to worship Him.  
With your hands, are you touching him,  
And with your heart are you loving Him,  
And with your hands  
Are you holding on to His,  
Then source of life  
Was right there in your hands.
