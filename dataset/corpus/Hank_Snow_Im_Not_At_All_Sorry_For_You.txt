Don't come to me with tears in your  
Eyes just because he couldn't be true  
And expecting me to sympathize  
I'm not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize all that you been through  
Because you treated me just  
The way he's treating you  
It's too late now to stop worryin'  
You I'm not at all sorry for you  
  
Do you remember the tears that  
I cried on the light you said he were true  
Like the tears that you now try  
To hide I'm not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize
