[Spoken] The King is pleased!  
He is pleased with me!  
My Lord and Master  
Declares he's pleased with me-  
  
What does he mean?  
What does he know of me  
This lord and master?  
When he has looked at me what has he seen?  
Something young  
Soft and slim,  
Painted cheek,  
Tap'ring limb,  
Smiling lips  
All for him,  
Eyes that shine  
Just for him-  
So he thinks...  
  
Just for him!  
Though the man may be  
My Lord and Master,  
Though he may study me  
As hard as he can,  
The smile beneath my smile  
He'll never see  
He'll never know I love another man  
He'll never know, I love another man.
