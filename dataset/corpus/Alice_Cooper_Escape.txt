Paint on my cruel or happy face and hide me behind it  
It takes me inside another place where no one can find it  
Escape I get out when I can I escape anytime I can  
It's all escape I'm crying in my beer come on let's escape just get me out of
here  
Don't get me wrong don't get me right I'm not like you are  
When I get home from work at night I'm blacker and bluer  
So I escape I get out when I can escape anytime I can  
It's all escape I'm crying in my beer escape just get me out of here  
But where am I running to there's no place to go  
Just put on my make up and get me to the show yeah escape  
Yeah what are you waitin' for  
My doctor said just come around you'll be taken care of  
And in while he ran my problems down I stole his mascara  
That's how I escape I get out when I can I escape anytime I can  
I escape I'm crying in my beer it's escape just get me out of here  
Escape let's get out while we can it's escape anywhere we can  
Come on it's escape nobody wants to surround here anyway  
Escape what are you waitin' for escape escape I escape  
Come on darling let's escape escape escape escape escape  
I gotta get out of here I gotta get out of here I gotta get out of here
