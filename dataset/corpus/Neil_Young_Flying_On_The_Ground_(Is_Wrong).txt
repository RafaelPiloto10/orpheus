Is my world not falling down  
I'm in pieces on the ground  
And my eyes aren't open  
And I'm standing on my knees  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Turn me up or turn me down  
Turn me off or turn me round  
I wish I could have met you in a place  
Where we both belong  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child  
Sometimes I feel like a kid  
But baby, since I have changed  
I can't take nothing home  
City lights at a country fair  
Never shine but always glare  
If I'm bright enough to see you  
You're just too dark to care  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you
