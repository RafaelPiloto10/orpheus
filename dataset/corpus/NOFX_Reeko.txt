Reeko, try to understand, it really is that bad  
It won't just go away, the party's over  
It's past two o'clock, so it's about time we  
Stopped, 'cause I  
See the keg has been sucked dry  
  
The Crisco was emptied into the aquarium  
Where the fish all seems to play the ex lax lines  
The dog bowl  
The toilet's overflowed, we've had our fun so  
Now there's nothing left to damage  
We got no place left to go  
  
Mr. President please understand, it really is that vbad  
It won't just go away, it's just beginning  
The ballots have been casty, we make like seaward rats  
Leave this sinking ship, leave and not look back  
  
The things we neer tried to disallow  
Have come back to haunt us now  
With apple pie and Chevrolet  
We've come to see the end, we all made this bed  
Now we got nowhere to lay,  
Dies and gentlemen  
Try to understand
