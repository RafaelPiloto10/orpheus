Compare the best of their days  
With the worst of your days  
You won't win  
With your standards so high  
And your spirits so low  
At least remember...  
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
  
See the best of how they look  
Against the worst of how you are  
And again, you won't win  
With your standards so high  
And your spirits so low  
At least remember...  
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
Do your best and don't...
