If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a restless bird in flight?  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel  
Will you still be there for me  
Or will I awake to a faded love searching for freedoms gain  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a bird who yearns to fly?
