I can't forget the night we met how bright were stars above  
That precious memory lingers yet when you declared your love  
And then you went away and now each night and day  
  
I wonder why you keep me waiting, Charmaine, my Charmaine  
I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again  
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same  
I wonder if you ever think of me too ..  
I am waiting my Charmaine for you ...  
  
You went away on dreary day I knew you had to go,  
Mid tears and cheers I heard you say "Charmaine, I love you so"  
Tho old years turn to new my heart keeps calling you  
  
"I wonder why you keep me waiting" Charmaine cries in vain  
"I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again  
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams by the same  
I wonder if you ever think of me too"  
Charmaine's waiting, just for you.
