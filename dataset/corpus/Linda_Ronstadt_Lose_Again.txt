Save me  
Free me  
From my heart this time  
Well the train's gone  
Down the track and I'm  
I'm left behind  
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Well the heart calls  
And the mind obeys  
Oh it knows better than me baby  
And if I hold on for one more day  
Oh maybe maybe he'll be true  
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Woah I'll love you and lose again
