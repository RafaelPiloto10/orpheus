I didn't think too much about books and schoolin'  
Cause there was more important things to do  
I'd just sit out in the yard and pick my old guitar  
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do  
  
I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower  
Wore my little fingers to the bone  
Well, I said I would never rest 'til I am the very best  
The best guitar picker in this whole county  
  
I said someday I know, I'll win my fame  
One day all the world will know my name  
I worked so very hard with that old guitar  
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do  
  
I would sit there all alone tryin' to pick out, old sweet home  
While everyone was in the yard  
Well, I said I would never stop 'til I've reached the very top  
The best guitar picker in the whole county  
  
The years have passed I haven't changed my mind  
Cause I still pick the guitar all the time  
Because I know someday I'm bound to learn to play  
All the things the big hillbillies do  
  
I just sit her in my shop pickin', foggy mountain top  
Tellin' everybody ain't that great  
Cause before I go to rest I'm gonna be the very best  
The best guitar picker in this whole county  
  
I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower  
Wore my little fingers to the bone  
But I said I would never rest til' I am the very best  
The best guitar picker in this whole county
