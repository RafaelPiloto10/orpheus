It's time for truth the barker said and poured his self a beer  
Oh yeah forsooth said Ben the Geek but who'll be left to hear  
They've driven off the fools and saints and now they've stole the show  
It's all a bloody circus mates and clowns are in control  
If that's the truth said Marzipan the Midget from the floor  
I know there won't be no demand for Midgets anymore  
We used to be a novelty by simply being small  
But next to them unholy men now Tiny Tim looks tall  
And it's harder to matter at all when it's all comin' down (and it's all
comin' down)  
You've still got your duty to choose how you live or you die (that's just the
way it is)  
So many warnings to turn this old rascal around  
We better heed 'em while we got the freedom to try  
[ harmonica ]  
From the bombin' over Baghdad to the burnin' down at Waco  
In the television courtroom of our trials we can see  
If yow want to kill your parents or cut off somebody's business  
All you got to do is make them hate the victim and you're free  
Like Manuel Noriega Saddam Hussein David Koresh  
And it's harder to matter...  
We better heed 'em while we got the freedom to try
