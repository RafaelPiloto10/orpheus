I got that gas pack mega-ton green light  
Run up on me I'mma take you like walk in the trap just to see what the fiends
like  
Quavo Peter Piper had to pack a pistol  
I got the shooter nigga, I won't miss you  
Free my niggas, got the feelin' it's fuck the system  
Blowing money with the plug like a whistle  
The pot is butt naked, I examine it like a physical  
Listen up, this shit here critical  
I can teach him how to make it identical  
Remix, rerock go four days on a nigga pot  
Drip, drip, gotta sprinkle on the pot  
Baking soda make a young nigga knot

[Verse 2: Offset]  
It's a (?) your fitted nigga, you better pay attention  
30 round extension  
Bullets all up in your mouth like it's dentures  
You better surrender  
Better listen to me, I'm your mentor  
I'm not talkin' too much, ain't no lecture  
You gone catch all these bullets like Fletcher  
I pay them to kill you, I'm an investor  
(Greenlight)  
Hit the fuck nigga with the four-four  
I'm laughing like Elmo and I got more straps than velcro  
You know what it is, green light the nigga and kill all his kids  
I don't give a fuck about him, I had to show him what it is
