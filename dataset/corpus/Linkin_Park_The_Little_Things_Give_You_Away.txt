Water gray  
Through the windows, up the stairs  
Chilling rain  
Like an ocean everywhere  
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?  
I mean nothin' to you  
The little things give you away  
And now there will be no mistakin'  
The levees are breakin'  
  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
  
Hope decays  
Generations disappear  
Washed away  
As a nation simply stares  
  
Don't wanna reach for me do you  
I mean nothin' to you  
The little things give you away  
But there will be no mistakin'  
The levees are breakin'  
  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under ground now  
Now I...  
Now I do  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)  
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)  
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
