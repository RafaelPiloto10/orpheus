I buy the nicest things from a super market store  
Vitamin land and marzipan and I know just what they're all for  
I've organized my useless life in a way I've never done before  
Even visit the dentist now  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old  
  
I just can't wait to see that city on the moon  
With air conditioned gardens that'll play your favorite tune  
I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'll do  
Even sweep the roads to be there  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old  
  
I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'll do  
Even sweep the roads to be there  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old
