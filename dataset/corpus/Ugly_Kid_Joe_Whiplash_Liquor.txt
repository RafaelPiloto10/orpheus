Suburban white alcoholic trash  
We ain't glam and we ain't trash  
We're victims of a society  
That fucks with me about sobriety  
  
They say don't drink this and don't drink that  
'Cause it does a little more than just make you fat  
It's a serious disease that you learn about in school  
And if your dad's an alcoholic you'll be one too  
  
Mom and dad don't have a clue  
The one-fifty-one is now eighty proof  
And all the times I borrowed the car  
Not as a ride but as a shitface bar  
  
Fuck yeah! I got the venom in my veins  
God damn! This shit is drivin' me insane  
Boo ya! I ain't ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor, sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker, it's the best!  
  
Weekend comes and my parents are gone  
It's time to party once I mow the lawn  
Havin' fun ain't that a fact  
It's rock 'n' roll in the cul-de-sac!  
  
Invite everyone and your neighbors too  
It's gonna be a whacked out rock 'n' roll zoo  
But don't be blabbin' it around my mother  
But invite everyone and your skate rat brother  
  
Fuck yeah! I got the venom in my veins  
God damn! This shit is drivin' me insane  
Boo ya! I ain't ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor, sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker, it's the best!
