Well I dreamed I was standin' in the middle of a river,  
Someone waited on the other side.  
My body shivered in the rushing icy water.  
I cried out but no one could hear me.  
I tried to swim but it was much too far.  
I felt a hand pull me up as I was going under.  
Somebody's waiting there to catch you  
You don't have to be afraid now baby.  
Nobody really knows for sure,  
Just open up your heart.  
Don't be afraid, someone will catch you if you fall too far.  
Sometimes you feel like you're invisible  
There's a crowd but you're all alone.  
Can't they see your heart is breaking?  
You pretend that it just doesn't matter,  
Try to keep smilin' baby hope against hope.  
Love is gonna find you and set you free  
Somebody's waiting there to catch you  
You don't have to be afraid now baby.  
Nobody really knows for sure,  
Just open up your heart.  
Don't be afraid, someone will catch you if you fall too far.  
Too far.
