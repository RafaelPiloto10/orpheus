I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain  
Let's go inside my astral plane  
Find out my metal's based on instrumental  
Record hey, so I can write monumental  
  
Methods, I'm not the king  
But niggas is decay I stick 'em for the cream  
Check it, just how deep can shit get  
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it  
  
In your cross color, clothes you've crossed over  
Then got totally crossed out and Kris Cross  
Who the boss? Niggaz get tossed to the side  
And I'm the dark side of the force  
  
Of course it's the Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan  
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece protect it  
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus  
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it, styles I gets buck wild  
  
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files  
I'm sick, insane, crazy, drivin' Miss Daisy  
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze  
  
Is it real son, is it really real son  
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real  
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one  
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real  
  
And when I was a lil' stereo  
(Stereo)  
I listened to some champion  
(Champion)  
I always wondered  
(Wondered)  
Will now I be the numba' one?  
(Yo)  
  
Now you listen to the Gorgon  
(Gorgon)  
And the Gorgon summary  
(Yo)  
And any man that come test me  
(Test me)  
Me wanna lick out them brains  
(It's that why)
