Dear, I thought I'd drop a line.  
The weather's cool. The folks are fine.  
I'm in bed each night at nine.  
P.S. I love you.  
  
Yesterday we had some rain,  
but all in all I can't complain.  
Was it dusty on the train?  
P.S. I love you.  
  
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able.  
They came around to call.  
I burned a hole in the dining room table.  
And let me see, I guess that's all.  
  
Nothin' else for me to say,  
and so I'll close. Oh, by the way,  
everybody's thinkin' of you.  
P.S. I love you.  
  
I do my best to obey all your wishes.  
I put a sign up. Think  
now I got to buy us a new set of dishes,  
or wash the ones that have piled in the sink.  
  
Nothing else to tell you, dear.  
Except, each day feels like a year.  
Every night I'm dreamin' of you.  
P.S. I love you.  
P.S. I love you.
