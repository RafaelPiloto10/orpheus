There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me  
Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy  
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away  
Afraid to say what was on my mind  
Afraid to say what I need to say  
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around  
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down  
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I wait till the upper hand is mine  
  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
  
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies  
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside  
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long  
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on  
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line  
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time  
Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine  
  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
Now it's all gone.  
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say  
You realize you divide us but you lied anyway  
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all  
But what goes up has got to fall  
  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
Now it's all gone.
