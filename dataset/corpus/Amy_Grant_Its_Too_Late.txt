Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time  
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying  
One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
It used to be so easy living here with you  
You where light and breezy and I knew just what to do  
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
There'll be good times again for me and you  
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too  
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you  
But it's too late, baby, it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it
