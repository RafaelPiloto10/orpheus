All I ever wanted was to get away  
And spend some time alone, yeah  
To a big house in the country  
To a private yacht with wall street on the phone  
And a million dollar paradise  
Maybe I could sing a better song  
I've found something different now  
And I finally understand  
That money gets you everywhere  
It slips straight through your hands  
Yes, it's love that makes the world go round  
And it's nationwide, from town to town  
It's got me coming up and going down  
And it makes everything alright, yeah  
I'd give you what I got and that's a start, oh yeah  
To get next to you and the keys to your heart  
There's something going on here  
Something going on behind your eyes  
You got me feeling kind of nervous  
With that Mona Lisa smile  
And maybe I could get a steady job  
Bring home the bacon 9 to 5  
See I'd do anything to win you  
Anything at all, I've got my cards  
Down on the table, baby, we could have a ball  
Yes, it's love that makes the world go round  
And it's nationwide, from town to town  
It's got me coming up and going down  
And it makes everything alright, yeah  
I'd give you what I got and that's a start, oh yeah  
To get next to you and the keys to your heart  
You may not think that I'm your type  
But baby you're my cup of tea  
You got me going 'round in circles and thinking to myself  
I can't visualize my future with anybody else, no way  
It's love that makes the world go round  
And it's nationwide, from town to town  
It's got me coming up and going down  
And it makes everything alright, yeah  
I'd give you what I got and that's a start, oh yeah  
To get next to you and the keys to your heart  
Believe me, to get next to you and the keys to your heart
