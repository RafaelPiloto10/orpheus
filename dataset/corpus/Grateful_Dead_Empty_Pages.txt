Empty pages before my eyes, you not deny or criticize  
Empty bedrooms where I paid my dues  
Watching the ceiling instead of you  
Can you tell me where you're goin', can't hold on to hear my song  
I've got some songs I'd love to sing  
Always bring down some other thing  
Where can I go my hands are broken  
It seems like your love is just a token, why won't you stay with me?  
Up in the morning and out the door  
She won't come in I gotta live alone  
Back in the evening with the darn poor fool out  
I got on mind just this gal, just this gal
