The traveler is always leaving town  
He never has the time to turn around  
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere  
He seems to be completely unaware  
  
The traveler is always leaving home  
The only kind of life he's ever known  
When every moment seems to be  
A race against the time  
There's always one more mountain left to climb  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday, you'll know where you are, remember  
  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
The traveler awaits the morning tide  
He doesn't know what's on the other side  
But something deep inside of him  
Keeps telling him to go  
He hasn't found a reason to say no  
  
The traveler is only passing through  
He cannot understand your point of view  
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find  
The traveler in me is close behind  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are
