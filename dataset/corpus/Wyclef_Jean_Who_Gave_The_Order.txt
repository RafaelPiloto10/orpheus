I'm Buju Banton with the preacher's son  
  
Who gave the orders  
For them to go, alright  
Who gave the orders  
Martin was shut down, ah, alright  
Who gave the orders  
To drop the bomb, we want to know  
Who gave the orders  
No refugees across the borders, yeah  
  
Questions asked with no response, ey, Wyclef  
Who's gonna answer  
Where did all these guns come from, tell me, ey  
Who's gonna answer  
Feeding lies to our daughters and sons  
But they will have to answer  
Then what you gonna do when the Rastaman comes  
Where you gonna run for cover  
  
Looking through the window of my ire eyes  
On this city filled with lies  
Observing the people working so hard  
Doing whatever it takes to get by  
Then I look at myself and realize  
That I was put here for a reason  
Lord knows I've done my best and I've tried  
We gon' keep trying  
  
Who gave the orders  
For them to go, Lord no  
Who gave the orders  
Martin was gunned down, oh  
Who gave the orders  
To drop the bomb, my God  
Who gave the orders  
No refugees across the borders, who  
  
Questions asked with no response, ey, Wyclef  
Who's gonna answer  
Where did all these guns come from, tell me  
Who's gonna answer  
Feeding lies to our daughters and sons  
They will have to answer  
Then what they gonna do when the Rastaman comes  
Where you gonna run for cover  
  
Well what you gonna do, what you gonna do, what are you gonna do  
Incarcerate a million and only free few  
What was done to others, it shall be done to you  
Open up your eyes and you will see the full view  
Work all day, and you can't get raise in pay  
Civilly bodies being taken away  
I wonder what the voice of the people have to say  
Stand up and defend your rights today  
  
Who gave the orders, who gave the orders  
For them to go  
Who gave the orders  
Martin was gunned down, Martin was gunned down, oh, Martin was gunned down  
Who gave the orders, who gave the orders  
To drop the bomb  
Who gave the orders, who gave the orders  
No refugees across the borders, no, no, no, no

Who's gonna answer  
Telling lies to our daughters and sons  
They will have to answer  
Then what they gonna do when the righteous man comes  
Where you gonna run for cover
