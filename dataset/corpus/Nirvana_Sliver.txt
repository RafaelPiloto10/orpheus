[Intro]  
Mom and Dad went to a show  
Dropped me off at grandpa Joe's  
I kicked and screamed  
Said, "Please, don't go!  
  
[Chorus]  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
  
Had to eat my dinner there  
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that  
I couldn't chew my meat too good  
  
[Chorus]  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
  
Said, "Why don't you stop your crying  
Go outside and ride your bike"  
That's what I did  
I killed my toe!  
  
[Chorus]  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
Grandma take me home!  
  
After dinner I had ice cream  
A bit of sleep and watched TV  
I woke up in my mothers arms!  
  
Grandma take me home! [x19]  
  
Wanna be alone!
