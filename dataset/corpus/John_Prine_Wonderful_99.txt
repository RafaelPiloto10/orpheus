You've heard about the dirty dozen and the tales of the green beret  
The men that sank the bismarck and the fighting c.i. a.  
But if you're talkin' danger then one name comes to mind  
Make an unwise decisioncall the wonderful 99  
  
It was way back in the nineties a dollar still was worth a dime  
An international coincidence made newsweek and time  
A hundred brave men or women, give or take a few  
Got started on a friday nightby monday they were back in school  
  
Two kings, a pope, and the president of the denver savings and loan  
Made and unwise decision, wished they'd stayed at home  
A missile launching pad didn't go as planned  
The wonderful 99 were called to deliver it by hand  
  
99 brave soldiers in 99 pair of keds  
Lookin' for a motel 6 with 99 twin beds  
A place to park a missile an watch some cable news  
Maybe rent the top gun video and grimace like tom cruise  
  
Now there's 99 yellow ribbons around the old oak tree  
Most of it's top secret, the rest is history  
It's been a couple weeks now, how the memory fades with time  
Of an unwise decision and the wonderful 99
