Father's waiting 'round the corner  
Ticket in his hand  
Wants to help his daughter  
Protect and understand  
Daughter's needing some security  
The comfort of a man  
Can't face the pain of losing  
She's afraid to love again  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
My father he said, "don't be misled."  
My father he said, "is heart in your hands?"  
  
(Way far, far away)  
Daughter's feelin' kinda shaky  
Heartache and trouble everywhere  
There ain't no love she's looking  
For someone who cares  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Take the train far, cooling down)  
Daughter's waiting at the station  
Got a ticket in her hand  
Bound for her destination  
She'll try to love again  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Father, father, father  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Father, father, father he said
