Make my life a prayer to You  
I want to do what You want me to  
No empty words, no white lies  
No token prayers, no compromise  
  
I want to shine the light You gave  
Through Your Son You sent to save us  
From ourselves and our despair  
It comforts me to konw You're really there  
  
Well, I want to thank You now for being patient with me  
Oh, it's so hard to see when my eyes are on me  
I guess I'll have to trust and just believe what You say  
Oh, You're coming again, coming to take me away  
  
I want to die and let You give Your life to me that I might live  
And share the hope You gave the me  
The love that set me free  
I want to tell the world out there  
You're not something or fairy tale  
That I've made up inside my head  
You're God the Son, You've risen from the dead  
  
I want to die and let You give Your life to me that I might live  
And share the hope You gave to me  
I want to share the love that set me free
