Now he walks in shadows  
He's tryin' to pretend she never walked away  
But it's not deceivin'  
He's closer to an end he never could foresee  
  
Where love goes  
When love dies, heaven knows  
  
But it's more than meets the eye  
So much more than just a last goodbye  
It's a cold and lonely heart  
So sad and torn apart  
Yes it's more than meets the eye  
  
Now he's in for trouble  
His luck has turned away, nobody seems to care  
Well there's a cold moon risin'  
And another lonely day has passed and she's not there  
  
Where love goes...  
  
But it's more than meets the eye...
