I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
Last night I cried myself to sleep  
For the one that makes me weep  
I dried my eyes to greet the day,  
And wondered why I had to pay  
The tears that I have shed by day  
Give relief and wash away  
The memory of the night before  
I wonder if I'll suffer more  
  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
My pride is made to say forgive,  
And take the blame for what you did,  
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of,  
I wonder if I'm still in love.  
My heart can't thrive on misery,  
My life it has no destiny,  
When things get more  
Than I can bear,  
I ask myself "Do I still care?"  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before
