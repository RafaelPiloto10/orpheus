Rain, tears of joy, tears of pain  
Is this really me  
Standing here at the station  
The card said I mustn't be late  
I've never been late  
I've never really had the chance  
Years and years and not even wanting a second chance  
'Look for a raincoat and a rose'  
  
I hope no one sees, they'll laugh I know  
He was always like that, yes it always showed  
Did I do something wrong to have to pay  
In many more ways than one  
Rainy day, what do I say  
How simple it's all become  
  
Love is for fools and fools have no grace  
Damn them while you can  
Out here on the fence is such a lonely place  
I wish I was foolish now  
The greatest of pain is never really knowing  
Maybe today I'll find out this way  
The way that I'm going
