I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles  
And the heavens open up every time she smiles  
And when I come to her that's just where I belong  
Yet I'm running to her like a rivers song  
  
She givesss me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
She givesss me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
  
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down  
And when I come to her when the sun goes down  
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief  
Takes away all of my heartache, in the night like a thief  
  
She givess me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
She givess me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
  
Crazy love, she givess me love, love, love, love, crazy love, mm  
  
Yes I need her in the daytime  
Oh, but I need her in the night  
Yes I want to throw my arms around her  
Kiss her hug her, kiss her hug her tight  
  
And when I'm returning from so far away  
She givess me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day  
Yes it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole  
And it makes me mellow down in to my soul  
  
She givesss me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
She givesss me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
  
She givesss me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
I need her love, love, love, love, crazy love  
  
Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love
