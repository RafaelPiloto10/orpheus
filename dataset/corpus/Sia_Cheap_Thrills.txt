[Verse 1]  
Come on, come on, turn the radio on  
It's Friday night and I won't be long  
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on  
It's Friday night and I won't be long  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Til I hit the dance floor  
Hit the dance floor  
I got all I need  
No I ain't got cash  
No I ain't got cash  
But I got you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
But I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing  
  
[Verse 2]  
Come on, come on, turn the radio on  
It's Saturday and I won't be long  
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on  
It's Saturday and I won't be long  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Til I hit the dance floor  
Hit the dance floor  
I got all I need  
No I ain't got cash  
No I ain't got cash  
But I got you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
But I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing  
  
[Bridge]  
(I love cheap thrills)  
(I love cheap thrills)  
I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing  
Oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing  
  
[Outro]  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)
