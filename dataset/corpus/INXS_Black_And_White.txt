Could be clear black and white  
Make a decision  
Got a need inside and I don't know why  
It's a strong feeling that grows and grows  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
New moment goes like this  
Never forbidden  
There's nothing to stop  
The thief on time, stealing  
The hours that keep you away  
  
It rushes through my veins  
Straight to my head  
My mind is a planet  
For you to roam  
  
This is only just the start  
It's the beginning  
There's nothing to stop  
The thief of time  
Stealing the hours  
That keep you away  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
In this house I call home  
Living together  
Got a need inside  
And I don't know why  
It's a strong  
Feeling and it grows and grows  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
This is only just the start  
It's the beginning  
  
New moment goes like this  
Never forbidden  
  
Could be clear black and white  
Make a decision
