A tramp found dead, in the street, just made the news  
Forensics report read 'drug abuse'  
Found a warehouse slip in his sleeve  
Marine corps major down-at-heel  
  
They got to the place, unlocked the she'd  
Soon left awestruck, stunned, amazed  
Among stuff and things lay pledges and bonds  
Up to a few Mil in the end  
  
The sage the fool the sinner  
And what goes for you, one can't ever say  
The sage the fool the sinner  
  
One can't foretell fate, no way, no way  
  
Sassy lady puts on her fav heels  
Mirror checked, all done - snow white appeal  
Adjust the dress, ready to leave  
Grab some cash, cab's outside, wipe off a tear  
  
On her way out, she turns once more  
To wave her man good - bye  
While in his sleep, he recalls thirty years - due to end that night.
