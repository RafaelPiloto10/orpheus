Please, I beg you hear this humble voice  
Please, pale orchid flower, music of my soul  
Alone, upon the windswept way  
Descends the nightingale  
She swoops to soothe my aching brow  
Let us now make love  
  
Please, I beg you hear this humble voice  
Please, my emerald goddess, wash away the wounds  
Alone, the pilgrim thirsts and falls  
The Queen runs to his call  
She stoops to soothe his aching brow  
Let us now make love  
  
Make love, make love  
Let us, let us, let us make love (love, love)  
Love, sweet heavenly love (love, love)  
I promise you life will be good (love, love)  
If you just stand down and try (love, love)  
To be one with, so feel pride  
  
Let us make love till the end of time  
Now and forever  
  
Please, I beg you hear this humble voice  
Please, dear oyster shell reveal your hidden pearl  
Alone, the deaf, the sick, the blind  
Turn grimly for the knife  
The prophet stoops to soothe their brow  
Let us now make love  
  
Make love, make love  
Let us, let us, let us make love (love, love)  
Sweet heavenly love (love, love)  
I promise you life will be good (love, love)  
If you just stand down and try (love, love)  
To be one with, so feel pride  
  
Let us make love till the end of time  
Now and forever  
  
Please, I beg you hear this humble voice  
Come, let's walk the windy roads to find the truth  
Revealed, each part has now been played  
Your beauty will not fade  
So cling to me, fulfill your vow  
Let us now make love  
  
(Love, love)  
Sweet heavenly love (love, love)  
I promise you life will be good (love, love)  
If you just stand down and try (love, love)  
To be one with, so feel pride  
  
Let us make love till the end of time  
Now
