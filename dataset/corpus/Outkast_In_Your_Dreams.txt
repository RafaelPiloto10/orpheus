[Chorus]  
We spent summer dreaming, when we could be leaving,  
I get wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up  
I guess I'll get you in your dreams  
I guess I'll get you in your dreams  
I get wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up  
I guess I'll get you in your dreams  
  
The moon's around my sun, and my nights around my days  
Nocturnal creature by habit Bruce Wayne know what I mean  
I mean I'm in between sunset and sunrise  
As its on type of nigga for the home invasion surprise  
Mother fucker pow-pow lay the fuck down now  
Now no, don't try to talk your way out  
Because I'm usually non violent, positively vibing  
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you,  
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it  
But it's simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it,  
Pardon me one moment I just went off on a tangent  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Typical day off in the A, aye  
But nicks up the Chevrolet, aye  
Nigga wanna rob okay, okay  
Where he stand is where he lay, aye  
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill,  
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill,  
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head  
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead  
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes,  
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas  
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare  
I will bust there motherfucking head, ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin',  
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up  
  
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'  
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up  
  
That's the way a  
  
Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'  
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up (yeah)  
  
Now we know when, (know when), holding, (holding) showing, controlling,  
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up (oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I guess I'll get you in your dreams  
  
I guess I'll get you in your dreams [
