Love Affair  
By Nat King Cole  
Album:  
  
Our love affair is a wonderous thing  
That we'll rejoice in remembering  
Our love was born with out first embrace  
And a page was torn out of time and space  
  
Our love affair  
May it always be  
A flame to burn through eternity  
So take my hand  
With a reverent prayer  
That we may live  
And we may share  
A love affair to remember  
  
So take my hand  
With a reverent prayer  
That we may live  
And we may share  
A love affair to remember
