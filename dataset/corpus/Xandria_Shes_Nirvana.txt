Do you dare to taste her soul  
Do you like to trick control  
Did you think this world was real  
Realize this was the deal  
she's ether fire - burns away all the dire  
You will feel her touch for a while  
do you see her through the waves  
Do you think it's her who saves  
With a blink of radiant eye  
Would you really dare to try  
she's like a fawn - just appears and then gone  
What remains will be just this one song  
she's eternity behind her disguise  
You have almost seen a world in her eyes  
But you've known that it would never be born  
She's flown away like a leave in a storm  
she's bliss - she's ether - she's dark - she's nirvana
