Verse 1  
  
The Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear  
The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid  
  
Verse 2  
  
When the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came  
Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell Though  
An host should rise up against me my heart shall not fear though  
War should rise against me in this will I be confident  
One thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after  
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life  
  
Verse 3  
  
To behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple  
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion  
In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me  
He shall set me up upon a rock  
And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me  
Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy  
I will sing yea  
I will sing praises unto the Lord  
Hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me

When thou saidst Seek ye my face my heart  
Said unto thee Thy face Lord will I seek  
Hide not thy face far from me  
Put not thy servant away in anger  
Thou hast been my help  
Leave me not neither forsake me  
O God of my salvation When my father and my mother forsake me  
Then the Lord will take me up  
Teach me thy way O Lord  
And lead me in a plain path  
Because of mine enemies  
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies  
For false witnesses are risen up against me and such as  
Breathe out cruelty I had fainted  
Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the
living

Wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart  
Wait I say on the Lord
