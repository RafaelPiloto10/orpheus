Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk.  
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.  
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark  
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.  
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,  
There's nothing like walking and having a "heart to heart."  
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.  
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.
