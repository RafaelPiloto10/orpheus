I'm lost in you, I'm lost in love  
What can I do, words not enough  
I'm lost in space, I'm lost in you  
Oh my babe, what can I do?  
I'm lost in your eyes, in your disguise  
Oh you can run but you can't hide  
I'm lost in space, I'm lost in you  
Oh my babe, what can I do?  
  
Fly to the moon  
I'm coming soon  
I swear to you  
My baby blue  
Fly to the moon for your sweet love  
What can I do can't turn it off  
I die for you and your sweet love tonight  
  
We two are one and I'm still here  
Together strong, don't disapear  
I'm lost in space, I'm lost in you  
Oh my babe what can I do  
Don't tell me lies under the sky  
Where we had love, don't say goodbye  
I'm lost in space, I'm lost in you  
Oh my babe, what can I do
