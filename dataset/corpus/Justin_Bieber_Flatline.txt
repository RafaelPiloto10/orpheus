Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me  
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know  
How come you act so different?  
Talk to me I'll listen  
All the love I'm giving  
Don't act like you don't know  
  
I was out there on the road  
Life out of control  
She became a victim to my busy schedule  
And I know that it's not fair  
That don't mean that I don't care  
This one's dedicated to the girl out there  
  
Girl you always catch me at the bad time  
When I know you probably think it's a lie  
I know I told you last time was the last time  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Flatline [x2]  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
  
Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing  
Said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it  
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me  
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what imma do now
