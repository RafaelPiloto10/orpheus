Yeh, yeh, we need the rain,  
Yeh, yeh, to wash the trains,  
Endless nights,  
Tortured days,  
Trains of no return.  
  
Lo'el ani akro aneni  
Avka bachol lailo aneni  
Ten tal umotor aneni  
Ho, aneni  
  
Don't let them grow again,  
Oh, no, not again!  
Don't let them roll again,  
The trains of no return!  
  
Yeh, yeh, we need the rain,  
Yeh, yeh, to wash the trains,  
Endless nights,  
Tortured days,  
Trains of no return.  
  
Lo'el ani akro aneni, aneni, aneni  
Sham za'aku kolot anenu  
Ba'aru orot anenu  
Hu lo yeshaker  
  
Kol ha'or, kol hachoshe  
She yofer mikol ra'you eich  
Din ha'elohim molech  
Hem gam me vakshim  
  
Yeh, yeh, we need the rain,  
Yeh, yeh, to wash the trains,  
Endless nights,  
Tortured days,  
Trains of no return.  
  
Don't let them grow again,  
Oh, no, not again!  
Don't let them roll again,  
The trains of no return!  
Don't let them grow again,  
Oh, no, not again!  
Don't let them roll again,  
The trains of no return!  
Yeh, yeh, we need the rain...
