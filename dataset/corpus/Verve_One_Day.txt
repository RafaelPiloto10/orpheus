One day maybe we will dance again  
Under fiery skies  
One day maybe you will love again  
Love that never dies  
  
One day maybe you will see the land  
Touch skin with sand  
You've been swimming in the lonely sea  
With no company  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The roads, the highs, breaking up your life  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe you will cry again  
Just like a child  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The times, the highs, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
Oh, you're too afraid to touch  
Too afraid you'll like it too much  
The roads, the times, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe I will dance again  
One day maybe I will love again  
One day maybe we will dance again  
You know you've gotta  
Tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
One day maybe you will love again  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end
