Went through the attic today  
Found a note you wrote packed away.  
And I started reliving the past  
When I saw his face.  
  
Suddenly to my surprise  
I felt a tear fall from my eyes.  
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets.  
  
You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets.  
  
A face on a crowded street  
An old movie on T.V.,  
A song on the radio  
Can bring it all back.  
  
Years roll by,  
One by one,  
All things change,  
But there's always someone,  
The heart never forgets,  
No the heart never forgets.  
  
You can find someone,  
And live your life,  
Put an old memory out of your mind,  
But the heart never forgets.  
  
The heart never forgets,  
No the heart never forgets.  
You can find someone,  
And live your life,  
Put an old memory out of your mind,  
But the heart never forgets.  
No the heart never forgets.  
Ooh, yeah.  
Dawn
