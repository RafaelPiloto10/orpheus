I stayed awake for hours again last night  
Searchin' for a reasoning to keep up the fight  
I've made choices I'll regret  
I've got problems I don't get  
I didn't wanna carry the heavier load  
You can't always take the middle road  
There comes a time when you make up your mind  
And the point gets left behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's wait one more day for the conversation  
One more day to make it right  
Let's get away from the confrontation  
One more day just buying time  
  
For years and years you can drift along  
And write another verse to an endless song  
Wait one more day til the time is right  
Hopin' that you both see the light  
You won't see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not afraid to be alone  
I'm not afraid to be alone  
  
I stayed awake for hours again last night  
Searchin' for a reasoning to keep up the fight  
I've made choices I don't regret  
I've got problems and problems and problems  
  
[Chorus]  
Just buying time [Repeat x2]
