[Verse:]  
You know from the moment she turned around  
She knows how to back it up and drop it down  
She knows, she wants all the fellas looking at her  
Cause they know as soon as our song come, it's a wrap  
  
Does she love the attention?  
Does she get it when she moves?  
  
Showin' out with her homegirls  
Hypnotizing all the dudes  
  
[Hook:]  
She knows  
She knows  
I know, I know, she knows  
And I know, I know, she knows  
  
[Verse 2:]  
She bad mixing ratchet with the classic girl  
So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me  
I told her, shawty  
You so right, but you so wrong  
She said, daddy, I'll be back after this song  
Then you're taking me home  
  
She loves the attention that she get when she move  
Showin' out with her homegirls  
Hypnotizing all the dudes  
  
[Hook:]  
She knows  
She knows  
I know, I know, she knows  
And I know, I know, she knows  
  
[Juicy J:]  
(rap)  
  
[Bridge:]  
She loves the attention that she get when she move  
Showin' out with her homegirls  
Hypnotizing all the dudes  
  
[Hook:]  
She knows  
She knows  
I know, I know, she knows  
And I know, I know, she knows
