[Intro]  
Tunechi, baby  
  
[Verse 1]  
Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard  
And my girlfriend think she too much, all she do is get pretty  
I get shit faced, don't we make a cute couple?  
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks  
I gotta posse full of hittas and a pocket full of In God We Trust  
It's been so long since I said "It cost too much"  
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle and withdrawal sucks And dead
presidents act immortal, but I know you see money's not a problem  
Bald like a butch bitch  
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill  
Money in the shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?  
Baby I'm my own boss, "Dwayne you gon' get you fired"  
  
[Chorus]  
But I feel Good, I knew that I would, yeah, I feel Good  
I'm smoking that good, I feel good my girl got that good, yeah  
Girl your pussy so good  
And these hoes is no good  
But I got you, yeah  
Girl your pussy so good  
And these hoes is no good  
But I got you, yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
(Tunechi, baby, yeah)  
They say "Boy put some money aside," "Don't tell me what to do with mine"  
All my kids already rich and they kids, and they kids  
They think money grow on trees and as tall as they grew I climbed  
Knock knock "Who's There?" Ha  
I told the bitch it's just money the road can get a lil bumpy  
So on the low I got that blow and ya know it's gon' feel like a trumpet  
I'm going home to my lil mama, she call me Big Poppa, she get hard dick and
McDonalds  
Cause she so tired of them Whoppers  
I fucked her good so proper, she say my name in opera  
I turn into a piranha and eat it like tilapia  
She know I'm going through a lot so she say my name in Gospel  
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper and  
  
[Chorus]  
And I feel good, yeah I knew that I would, yeah and I'm still hood yeah  
Shoutout to my hood, I was sick of stunnin' but I feel cured  
Leave yo ass in the woods, yeah and these hoes is no good, no good but I got a
few, yeah  
These hoes is no good, these hoes is no good but fuck it I got you, fuck 'em I
got you  
  
[Outro]  
And I feel good  
Tunechi, baby, I feel good  
Like diamonds on wood, yeah, I feel good my girl got that good girl, yeah  
Girl yo pussy so good and these hoes is no good, but I got you yeah
