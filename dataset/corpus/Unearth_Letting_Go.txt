Thought I knew you  
But I was wronged  
Waves of Torment  
Drowning me, for far too long  
Inhibitions speak,  
Seems like now, and forever  
  
You don't,  
You don't have to break me  
I swear next time, I'll let you know  
You won't,  
You won't get to break me  
I swear next time, I'm letting go  
  
Fear and guilt, they've help me down  
  
Conscience breathing deep  
Seeing light for the very first time  
The tides they turn and push me down  
Confrontation speaks, seems like now, not forever  
And in my mind, I'm gaining ground  
  
You don't,  
You don't have to break me  
I swear next time, I'll let you know  
You won't,  
You won't get to break me  
I swear next time,  
I'm letting go  
  
This wasted time  
My troubled mind  
I'll let you know,  
One Last Time  
  
This broken hold  
My fragile soul  
I'm letting go,  
For the Last Time  
  
For the Last time
