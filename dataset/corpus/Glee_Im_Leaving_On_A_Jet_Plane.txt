All my bags are packed,  
I'm ready to go,  
I'm standing here,  
Outside your door,  
I'd hate to wake you up to say goodbye.  
  
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,  
The taxis waiting, he's blowing his horn,  
I'm ready, I'm so lonesome I could die.  
  
So kiss me and smile for me,  
Tell me that you'd wait for me,  
Hold me like you'd never let me go.  
  
Coz I'm leaving on a jet plane,  
Don't know when I'll be back again,  
Oh babe, I hate to go,  
But I'm leaving on a jet plane,  
Don't know when I'll be back again,  
Oh babe.
