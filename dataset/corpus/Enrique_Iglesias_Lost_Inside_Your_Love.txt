I could never miss your love  
As warm as a Miami day  
I could never get enough  
Wetter than an ocean wave  
  
Now one is the key, two is the door  
Three is the path that will lead us to four  
Five is the time you kidnap my mind  
Into ecstasy  
  
I'm lost inside your love  
Believe me  
And if I don't come up  
Then leave me  
Inside your love forever  
  
Lost inside your love  
When the two of us are one  
There's no place I'd rather be, oh no  
I'm disappearing in your love  
Wilder than my wildest dreams, oh yeah  
  
Now one is the key, two is the door  
Three is the path that will lead us to four  
Five is the time you kidnap my mind  
Into ecstasy  
  
I'm lost inside your love  
Believe me  
And if I don't come up  
Then leave me  
Inside your love forever  
Lost inside your love  
  
Over and over, you know what I need  
I see over and over you keep taking me  
A little bit too far  
A little bit too deep  
  
Lost inside your love  
Believe me  
And if I don't come up  
Then leave me  
Inside your love forever  
Lost inside your love  
I'm lost inside your love  
Believe me  
And if I don't come up  
Then leave me  
Inside your love forever  
Lost inside your love  
  
Lost inside your love
