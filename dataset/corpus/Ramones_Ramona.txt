Hey Johnny, hey Dee Dee  
Little Tom and Joey  
You know we're comin' over  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
You're getting better and better  
It's getting easier than ever  
Hey you kids in the crowd  
You know you like it  
When the music's loud  
  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
She always wants to come over  
Sweet sweet little Ramona  
I think I'll try and phone her  
  
I let her in if you're wondering why  
Cause she's a spy for the BBI  
I let her in and I started to cry  
And then I knew I wanted to die  
Oooh, little Ramona
