Go on and take her, it ain't no surprise boy  
I knew that someday it had to come  
Just let me offer a word to the wise, boy  
Oh, take a good look at what you've won  
Then turn around, boy, and try to forget her  
She's gonna hurt you, before she's gone  
'Cause, when she's good, lord, there ain't nothing better  
But, when she's wrong, she sure can be wrong  
She'll bring you sunshine so good that it's frightening  
Oh, but soon as the sun shines, start lookin' for rain  
You'll hear the thunder, before you see the lightening  
As soon as it's over, start lookin' for pain  
And you won't be sorry that you ever met her  
But you'll be thankful she don't last long  
'Cause when she's good, lord, there ain't nothing better  
But when she's wrong, she sure can be wrong
