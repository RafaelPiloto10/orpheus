Baby you're so beautiful  
And when I'm near you I can't breathe  
A girl like you gets who she wants  
When she wants it  
You're so out of my league  
I show you no emotion  
Don't let you see what you're doin' to me  
Imagine the two of us together  
But I've been livin' in reality  
  
Fear of rejection, kept my love inside  
But time is running out, so damn my  
Foolish pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't care if you think I'm crazy  
Doesn't matter if it tums out bad  
'Cause I've got no fear of losin' you  
You can't lose what you never had  
  
Rules are made for breaking  
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained  
I'll be no worse off then I am right now  
And I might never get the chance again  
  
Tried to fight it but it cannot be denied  
Told my heart I didn't want you but I lied  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you  
I been keepin' it inside feelin' I could die  
Now if you turn away then that's o.k.  
At least we'll have a moment before  
You say good-bye  
  
Here on the outside lookin' in  
Don't want to stay dreamin' 'bout  
What could have been  
I need to hear you speak my name  
Even if you shoot me down in flames
