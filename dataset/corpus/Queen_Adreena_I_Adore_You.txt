(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
They open my window... In comes the light,  
I froze in the corner... I pray for the night,  
But if it's you my dear who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you.  
Rise up my dark star... Face into the night,  
Come out of your corner.. Shine for the night,  
If it's you my love who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you.  
Climb out of the shadows... Crawl into the night,  
Fall out of the window... Die to the night,  
If it's you my love who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you...
