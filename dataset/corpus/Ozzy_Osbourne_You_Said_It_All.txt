Well I gotta funny feeling  
But I'm gonna stay cool  
Something's telling me I'm  
Gonna break all the rules  
Let me tell ya I'm not insecure  
But I gotta empty feeling  
Think that you got the cure  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
Well I'm feeling sober but I'm high on the throne  
Like a demon sick of sin and tired of being alone  
I've made a bed that's hard to lie in  
But if loving you is wrong can't do nothing but sin  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
Let them hang me, they would if they knew  
Even half the things I've been doing with you  
Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor  
And watch me swinging and I still want more  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say
