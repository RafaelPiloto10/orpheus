Time can heal a broken heart  
Oh, but does it really ease the mind  
I know it's hard for you  
Though you say that you're not longing for my touch  
I know it pains you much  
What's wrong, baby  
What's on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
What's wrong, baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Night begins with calls from you  
Oh, asking me if I'm alright  
I'm really not sure, baby  
I'm wondering if your love for me has gone away  
Like I heard you say  
What's wrong, baby  
What's on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
What's wrong, baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
It's hard to say  
We've made mistakes  
But when it's not over  
It's best to put pride away  
Two eyes should not cry the tears of regret  
'Cause two lips won't let go of an age old lover's lie  
Oh, baby, oh, oh  
What's wrong, baby  
What's on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
What's wrong baby  
What is on your mind  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
I'd do anything for you  
I will give you all my heart  
Did you leave a piece of love behind  
Oh, did you leave your love behind
