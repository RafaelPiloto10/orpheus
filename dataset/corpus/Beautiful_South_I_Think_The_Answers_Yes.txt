I'm walking through these pastures  
I'm picking up sweet fruit  
I'm shaking hands with people  
That previously I'd shoot  
But nothing will dissuade me  
Nothing will dilute  
I want to execute  
I want to execute  
  
And you tend to meet a lot of scum en route  
It doesn't mean you've joined the other side  
And because I still wear shorts and my smile is oh so cute  
It doesn't mean I'll run away and hide  
  
To a world where the leaders finally confess  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
To the burning of the Stock Exchange and bombing of the press  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
  
I'm walking through these corridors  
Where crime meets pantomime  
They're laughing and they're drinking  
On the swill of overtime  
And no-one seems to know about  
The death-wish that they've signed  
Ah, life's unkind  
Ah, life's unkind  
  
And they see me as a potential new recruit  
They rub their hands, slap their backs and smile  
But I still wear suspenders underneath my business suit  
So needn't worry about me for a while  
  
So to a world without hunger, where royalty face death  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
To the breaking down of barriers of North, South,  
East and West  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
  
And no-one seems to know about  
The death-wish that they've signed  
Ah, life's unkind  
Ah, life's unkind  
Life's unkind, life's unkind  
From poor old U2 to poor old Simple Minds  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas, rope or gas, rope or gas  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas, rope or gas
