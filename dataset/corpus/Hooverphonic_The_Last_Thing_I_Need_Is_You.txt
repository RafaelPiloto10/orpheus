Oh hey, what a glorious day it's been  
Oh lord, look at the mess I'm in  
My car broke down  
So I waited for a shuttle bus  
It never came, instead, I got the rain...  
  
I broke a heel, I chipped a nail  
I lost the dog, How could I feel?  
On days like these, on days like these...  
  
The last thing I need is you,  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you, a curse?  
  
Hey why can't you see, on days like this  
The last thing I need, is...  
  
A-Gee whizz what a barrel of fun it's been  
Oh yeah, laugh at the mess I'm in  
Hey hey, what a triple odd place to be  
The doctor says, that it's not good for me.  
  
I broke a tooth, I tore my shirt  
I lost the zip of my favorite skirt  
Then you told me... that I was a bore in bed.  
  
The last thing I need is you,  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you, a curse?  
  
Hey why can't you see  
On days like this  
The last thing I need, is...  
  
Baa baa ba-baa baa  
Baa baa ba-baa baa  
Baa baa ba-baa baa  
Baa baa ba-baa baa  
  
The last thing I need is you  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you, a curse?  
  
Hey why can't you see,  
When I'm in a rush, or last in a cue  
When I need a break, The last thing I need is...
