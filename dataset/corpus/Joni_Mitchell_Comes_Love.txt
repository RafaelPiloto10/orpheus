Comes a rain storm  
Put your rubbers on your feet  
Comes a snow storm  
You can get a little heat  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
  
Comes a fire  
Firemen come and rescue me  
Blow a tire  
You can patch the inner tube  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hidin'  
'cause it isn't any use  
You'll just start slidin'  
When your heart turns on the juice  
  
Comes a heat wave  
You can hurry to the store  
Come a summons  
Hide yourself behind a door  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
  
Comes a headache  
You can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache  
See your dentist right away  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
  
Comes the measles  
You can quarantine the room  
Comes a mousie  
You can chase it with a broom  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
  
That's all brother  
If you've ever been in love  
That's all brother  
And you know just what I'm speakin' of  
  
Comes a nightmare  
You can always stay awake  
Comes depression  
You could get another break  
Comes love  
Nothing can be done  
Nothing can be done
