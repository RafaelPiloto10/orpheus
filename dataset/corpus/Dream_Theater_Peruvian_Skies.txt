There, there it is  
I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid  
Wait, I hear it again  
Don't turn on the lights until we  
Hear the way it ends  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysteria's  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that she's losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa  
  
Hey, I hope you know  
I'm taking all of this time with me when I go  
Shame, you're not to blame  
I'm the monster you created  
In your daddy's name  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysteria's  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that she's losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa  
  
Terror by night  
Liar by day  
Telling her secrets  
Won't take them away  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysteria's  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that she's losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa
