I know I never knew till now what love and life were all about  
I never could at any time forget the day that you were mine  
Another day, another night, I'm lost again, blue morning light  
I never could at any time forget the day that you were mine  
  
I want the ocean  
I want emotion  
I want your eyes, and oh your lullabys  
  
He's out there  
He's out there  
Feel good  
Feel good  
Feel good  
  
I want the ocean  
I want emotion  
I want your eyes, and oh your lullabys  
I want the ocean  
I want the ocean
