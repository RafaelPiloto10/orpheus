Only the magical transit children,  
sing, sing the lullaby, bah bah bah.  
Sitting on the pavement, sucking on a long straw.  
It's colorful, it's colorful, but it washes you out.  
  
Here is my violence, and here is the excuse.  
I learned it all, but only second hand.  
Falling into walls, well what is it with you.  
You never know, never know, never know.  
  
[Chorus]  
We planned it all this way  
We planned it all this way  
Pressure on Julian.  
  
Swimming in yellow pissy water.  
Sand getting in between their ears.  
No blood in head in this bloddy weather.  
Irate people with yellow tounges.  
  
Only the magical transit children,  
sing, sing the lullaby, bah bah bah.  
Falling into walls, well what is it with you.  
You never know, never know, never know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(There was pressure on Julian, pushing trolleys in the car park, from B to A,  
then back to B. Pressure on Julian, he keeps passing out,  
Poor, precious little snout, the birds are singing at night.  
Pressure on Julian)  
  
[Chorus]
