I need love  
There's nothing to do  
Don't need better  
Like a kick in the head  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
Our eyes met  
In the evening  
Now I want to see you everyday  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
I need love  
  
I need love  
As much as you do  
Don't need better  
Like a kick in the head  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
I need love
