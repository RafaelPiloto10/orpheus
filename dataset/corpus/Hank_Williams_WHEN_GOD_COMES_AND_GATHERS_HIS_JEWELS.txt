The ceremony was over  
A lad stood alone in tears  
For he had just said goodbye  
To the one he had loved through the years.  
  
He stood all alone with his head bowed down  
As though his heart would break  
Then the Parson came over and took his hand  
And to him these words he did say.  
  
[Chorus]  
When God comes and gathers his jewels  
All his treasures of diamonds and gold  
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair  
When God comes and gathers his jewels.  
(Substitute I'll meet her, on last chorus)  
  
Each night when the pale moon is shining  
You can see this lad all alone  
With his eyes lifted toward heaven  
He's repeating these words he was told.  
  
[Chorus]
