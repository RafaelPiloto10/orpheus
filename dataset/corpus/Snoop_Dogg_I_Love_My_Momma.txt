Momma, momma  
I love my momma

Through all the drama,  
Momma, momma  
I love my momma  
Check it out  
  
The first one to hold me (yeah)  
The first one to scold me (yes-o)  
You never cease to teach me  
And always try to reach me (momma)  
Took me to school the first day  
Taught me how to kneel, down and pray (amen)  
You learned me how to count from one to ten  
And never forget, where I've been  
Momma  
  
Yeah, I love my momma  
Through all the drama, I love my momma (I love my momma)

(listen here) Trip  
  
You taught me how to care  
You taught me how to share (f'real)  
You taught me how to love and to give  
thanks to the one above, I love you momma  
  
Yeah, I love my momma  
I love you momma, I love my momma, I love you momma  
I love you momma (I love you momma)

I love my momma (now you tell em Snoop)  
  
You taught me how to read and write, how to fight  
My do's and don't's, my wills and my won't's  
I'll never forget, the things that we went through  
Banging oldies in the living room, sipping brew  
Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then  
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend  
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end  
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends  
Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again  
She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again  
She taught me everything, but she didn't charge a fee  
She taught me everything, except how to see a G  
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me  
instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound  
I made you cry, you made me smile  
I just want to say I love you for life  
and that's the reason why I'm here now  
Love, Snoop

Momma, momma  
  
Your money wasn't always long (fo' sho')  
But your heart was forever strong (momma, momma)  
You taught me bout faith and hope  
And never ever get hooked on dope  
Momma (I love you, I love you momma)  
I love you momma (thought all the drama, I love my momma)
