Well, brother, better get right with God  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
While here upon this Earth, do try  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
(Chorus)  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Glad souls are singin'  
And the joy be ringin'  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
Well, get to church and listen to the preacher  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Get right with God and He'll be your teacher  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
(Chorus)  
Well, you better get on your knees and pray  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Let Jesus wash your sins away  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
(Chorus)  
  
(Repeat First Verse)  
(Chorus)  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?
