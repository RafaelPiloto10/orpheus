Well up in the evening down in Mobile, Alabama  
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer  
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes  
Trying to find somebody to take away these blues  
"She don't love me" hear them singing in the sun  
Payday's coming and my work is all done  
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low  
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow  
Sitting in a tepee built right on the tracks  
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back  
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about  
We've got an off-schedule train comin two miles about  
Everybody's trembling and running around  
Picking up their money, tearing the tepee down  
Foreman wants a penny [?] about to go insane  
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train  
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long  
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on
