Take the worst of this quirky world  
Roll it up in a ball  
Add the hair of a go-go girl  
Turn it into a dance that's called  
The bloody...  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
You'll see the oceans part  
you'll think your goin' blind  
You can talk about your daily grind  
While she'll dish out the soft shoe  
If makin' money doesn't suit your mind  
We've got something here  
Here for you  
You can sit there and suck your thumb  
Hear the rock and roll hum  
But you're just a crazy wall flower  
'Til you join all your friends on the floor  
And do the...  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
You'll see the oceans part  
you'll think your goin' blind  
Take your clothes off and start to shake  
Shake rattle and roll  
Watch the walls and the ceiling quake  
Let it move your body and soul  
And do the...  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
You'll see the oceans part  
you'll think your goin' blind.
