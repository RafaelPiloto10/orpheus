I got a Coupe De Ville  
I got a bed in the house  
Where you once lived.  
  
I had a few cheap thrills  
But they cost me a lot more  
Than I could give.  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself.  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else.  
  
Well, I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin'  
And I hit the wall.  
  
Yeah, I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin'  
And I hit the wall.  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself.  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else.
