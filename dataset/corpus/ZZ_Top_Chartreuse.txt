Chartreuse  
You got the color that turns me loose  
Chartreuse  
That color just turns me loose  
Better than Magenta  
Better than Fuse  
You got a shade that gets rid of the blues.  
  
Yeah chartreuse  
Don't you know I like big caboose  
Chartreuse  
You know I like that big caboose  
Its sure sweet,  
Lights my fuse  
Its sure sweet babe,  
Lights my fuse  
  
Chartreuse  
That color just turns me loose  
Chartreuse  
You got the color that turns me loose  
When you got the blues baby  
I got the juice  
If you get the blues lil' mama  
I got the juice
