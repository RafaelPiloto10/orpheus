You're coming down badly  
You're crippled inside  
A rat in your sewer  
You've no place to hide  
A gut wrenching fever  
Addicted to death  
You don't give a fuck  
If it means your last breath  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
You crave for the needle to stick in your vein  
Can't for the poison to kill all the pain  
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride  
That beautiful flower is eating your mind  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
Your name means nothing  
You don't know the score  
Body is aching you still crave for more  
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born  
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns  
  
You're chasing the dragon  
You're chasing the high  
A bird with one wing  
Who's still trying to fly  
You're all out of spirit  
A dead man alive  
A born again junkie  
You'll never survive  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie
