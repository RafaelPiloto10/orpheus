Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
In the event of my demise  
Be sure to include this statement  
When you are bent on closing my eyes  
Thinking about what my life meant  
Alone on a hill back in '65  
Things looked a lot like changing  
Singing our songs that we harmonized  
Dreaming of worlds rearranging  
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight  
Maybe it's time someone told you  
Just because you say you've seen the light  
Doesn't mean nobody sold you  
I can remember all of your smiles  
During the demonstrations  
Taking on what seemed like the whole world  
Igniting the hearts of our nations  
And together we sang our victory songs  
Though we were worlds apart  
Every thing then has now passed away  
Except for the love in my heart  
Sitting at home on computerized beds  
Tryine to come to conclusions  
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads  
Ignoring the states of illusion  
Drunk in a world of material wealth  
No one can notice you falling  
Fantastic flights once good tor your health  
Now make you deaf to your calling  
And all alone the prophet groans  
With words as yet unseen  
Who'll be awake when the master returns  
Who will be lost in their dreams  
So in the event of my demise  
8e sure to include this statement  
Only the words of love kept alive  
Are worthy of not being wasted
