Do you know what it means to me  
To delight in your company  
Could it happen to me  
Do you know what I'm certain of?  
I would love to fall in love  
Could it happened to me?  
Hey won't you look at me  
  
Now I'm cracked wide open I can't conceal  
My all-over trembling, I'm acting strange  
And while you're out of reach, I never change  
God knows I'm beside myself  
If a tear's a crime, then I must confess  
My guilty secret, I'm not ashamed  
Take me as I am, an average man  
Oh boy is it getting rough  
When my old world charm isn't quite enough  
I'd throw you cantos, I'd jazz 'em up  
When I lay me down, you don't pick up  
  
What's more, it's a crying shame  
Only this time no one but myself to blame  
All I touch turns to dust  
It's right there in my cards, I ought to cut  
Let us sing of the tortured heart  
And a lonely soul in this world apart  
As he plays a fear, takes a little pain  
And move our separate ways again  
Is it easy to say 'I do'?  
  
At this moment I love you  
See beyond me, it's true  
Now that evening is closing in  
Should I light that fire again?  
Could it happen to me?  
Did it happen to you?
