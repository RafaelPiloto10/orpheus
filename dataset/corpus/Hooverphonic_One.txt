You're in charge  
You always were  
There's no denying  
Fire burns  
I took a lot  
But now I'm gonna give  
Back to you  
Whatever I got  
  
Cause we are one  
And we'll always be  
You were born first  
Forever connected to me  
Connected to me  
  
It's not always how you want it to be  
We had no choice, oh desperately  
I had to leave  
Now I'm coming back  
We had to see  
You're white and I'm black  
  
Cause we are one  
And we'll always be  
You were born first  
Forever connected to me  
Connected to me  
Forever connected to me  
  
Cause we are one  
And we'll always be  
You were born first  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to one  
And we'll always be  
You were born first  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to me  
Forever connected to  
Me
