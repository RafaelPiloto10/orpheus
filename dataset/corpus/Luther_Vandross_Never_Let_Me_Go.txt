Just let me love you tonight  
Forget about tomorrow  
My darling, won't you hold me tight  
And never let me go  
  
Dry your eyes  
No tears, no sorrow  
Cling to me with all your might  
And never let me go  
  
A million times or more  
We said we'd never part  
But lately I find  
You're a stranger, stranger in my heart  
  
Give me the right  
In summer or in spring time  
To tell the world you are mine  
And you will never let me go  
And never let me go
