Amy's going out with John  
Now she's dating Paul  
Paul was dating Kelsey  
And Kelsey used to go out with me  
After I broke up with Amy  
  
Everybody's had, everybody's had everybody  
Everybody's had, everybody's had everybody once or twice  
  
Hey, you better watch what you say  
People love to talk, people love to gossip  
Yeah, but what is going around  
It's a hungry town, it's a leaky faucet  
  
Everybody knows, everybody's heard what you said  
Everybody knows, everybody's heard what you said  
Everybody knows, everybody's heard what you said  
Everybody knows, everybody's heard what you said  
  
It's a boomerang
