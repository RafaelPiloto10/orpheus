What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  
Haste, haste to bring him laud,  
The babe, the son of Mary  
The babe, the son of Mary  
The babe, the son of Mary
