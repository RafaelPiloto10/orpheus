As the time slips through your fingers  
Till it's almost time to go  
And the morning breaks between us  
And the ice melts into snow.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you  
  
Love and other bruises didn't have to choose us  
But it did and I'm alive and I'm trying to survive  
Love and other bruises makes us all good losers  
I can't help it talking loud it's because I'm on a cloud.  
Won't you please take me home  
Won't you please please take me home  
I'm so mixed up over you  
I don't want to be alone.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you
