Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness  
Crawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
Surrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used  
And because so, once was mine  
I walk this maze alone  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up  
  
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me, hate it fills me up  
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself
