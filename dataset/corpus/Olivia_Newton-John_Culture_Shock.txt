I've been tryin' to tell you  
I've been puttin' it off, puttin' it off, can't wait any longer  
You've been good to me and that only makes it harder to say what I gotta say  
  
You gotta know, I didn't plan it, it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time? Ooh ooh  
Now I don't wanna lose you, but I can't give him up  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
If I could go back and undo it  
If I had a time machine, I'd make it unhappen like a bad dream  
Honey you gotta know, I didn't plan it, it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time? Ooh ooh  
Now I don't wanna lose you, but I can't give him up  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
You're not takin' this too well, it's out of the question, I can tell  
It's not gonna work, is it  
  
Oh, I know it's unconventional, it's radical but practical  
I don't wanna lose you, no, but I'm not gonna give him up, no  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
Tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?
