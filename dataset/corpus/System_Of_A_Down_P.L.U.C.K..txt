Elimination  
Die  
Why walk down  
  
A whole race, genocide  
Taken away all of our pride  
A whole race, genocide  
Taken away  
Watch them all fall down  
  
Revolution  
The only solution  
The armed response  
Of an entire nation  
Revolution, the only solution  
We've taken all your shit  
Now it's time for restitution  
  
Recognition  
Restoration  
Reparation  
Recognition  
Restoration  
Reparation  
Watch them all fall down  
  
Revolution  
The only solution  
The armed response  
Of an entire nation  
Revolution  
The only solution  
We've taken all your shit  
Now it's time for restitution  
  
The plan was mastered  
And called genocide  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
Took all the children  
And then we died  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
The few that remained  
Were never found  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
All in a system of down  
Down, down, down  
Walk down  
  
Watch them all fall down  
Revolution  
The only solution  
The armed response  
Of an entire nation  
Revolution  
The only solution  
We've taken all your shit  
Now it's time for restitution  
  
The plan was mastered  
And called genocide  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
Took all the children  
And then we died  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
The few that remained  
Were never found  
(Never want to  
See you around)  
All in a system, down
