[Chorus:]  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  
  
[Verse:]  
Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel  
Will I dance for You Jesus, or in awe of You be still  
Will I stand in your presence, or to my knees will I fall  
Will I sing Hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all  
I can only imagine  
  
[Tag]  
The enemy has been defeated  
Death couldn't hold You down  
We're gonna lift our voice in victory  
We're gonna make your praises loud  
  
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph  
Shout unto God with a voice of praise  
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph  
We lift your name up  
We lift you name up  
  
[Ending]  
Better is one day  
Better is one day  
Better is one day  
Than thousands elsewhere
