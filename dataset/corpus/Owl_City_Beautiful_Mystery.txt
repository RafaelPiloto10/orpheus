When I'm dressed to the nines, I'm just a shirt and tie  
With a taste for prestige, and beautiful mystery.  
But, clever girls dressed to kill are pretty bittersweet,  
And better-suited for grief than beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
She enjoys it the most, with flowers in her hair.  
Dressin' up like a ghost for beautiful mystery.  
So I kiss her goodnight, and stumble from the room.  
Mighty high on mystique, and beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die!  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)
