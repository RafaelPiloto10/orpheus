Red eyed momma keep cryin'  
Blue eyed cat keeps a lyin'  
Catfish keep his eye on the string  
And that cotton mouth keep on windin'  
Sing, sing, sing  
Dark moon keeps hidin'  
And 'gator, he keeps right on slidin'  
And bull frog, he ain't mindin'  
Oh, cotton mouth keep on windin'  
Sing, sing, sing  
Lightnin' bugs in bottles  
They gimme all the light I need  
And I'm seinin' bait for linin'  
And that cotton mouth keeps on windin'  
Sing, sing, sing  
Oh, that big iron pot's a boilin'  
And that red eyed momma keeps toilin'  
And the crawdad meat's for dinin'  
And oh, that cotton mouth keeps on windin', lord  
Sing, sing, sing
