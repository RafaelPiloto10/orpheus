Straight out the casket, risin' up  
Open up your eyes, can't you see me  
What the fuck is this, madness  
Pick up my bones, erase my name from off the tombstones  
Alive and kickin', breathin' the air  
Call out my name punk and I'll be there  
No question, my suggestion to the action  
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin'  
Messin' with me, you're messin' with the best  
Blough, you're takin' two shots to the chest  
  
Chorus  
'Cause I'm back from the dead  
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)  
You know I'm back from the dead  
And I'll put a friggin' hole in your head  
Back from the dead  
Back from the dead  
  
You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected  
Back from the dead, just to mess with your head  
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it  
If you've got a cold, starve it  
If you've got a fever, feed it  
And if you can't feed it, then why not blow  
You might be positive and not even know  
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceilin'  
I give sexual healin', I'll get your girlie squealin'  
Like a pig, my grave's somethin' you can never dig  
I'll rock a mausoleum, backyard or colosseum  
  
Chorus ii  
'Cause I'm back from the dead  
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)  
You know I'm back from the dead  
House of Pain's in effect, 'nuff said  
  
Skip the autopsy, 'cause I never O. D. 'd  
I only puff boom kid I never get skeemed  
I don't sniff or shoot up, rip I'll stick my boot up  
Your ass quick fast Everlast don't jive  
Just like Pearl Jam, I'm still alive  
Spreadin' like tumors, gossip and lies  
Exaggerated reports of my demise, and if you believed'em  
Well then you got gassed, the media deceived'em  
Just like in the past  
  
Chorus  
  
Like Steven Segal I'm hard to kill  
And like G. G. Allen I'm crazy ill  
I'll beat ya down with my mic  
Kick your ass with my Nike  
Bust ya in the eye if ya tell another lie  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
Thinkin' I'm dead you must be smokin' dust  
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must  
  
Chorus ii  
  
Back from the dead
