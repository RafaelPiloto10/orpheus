He loves me. Even when I fall beneath His will.  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
When my broken heart just won't keeps still.  
He loves me oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Even though He knew sometimes I'd fall.  
Yet and still my name He called. He loves me.  
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
He loves me. Even though I was born in sin.  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Took me like I was and now I'm free again  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Even though He knew that Keisha would fall.  
Yet and still my name He knows. He loves me.  
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
He loves me. Fall beneath Your will. But He loves me.  
You yet and still loves me. This old broken heart just  
won't keep still. Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
Jesus loves the little children.  
When nothing else could help, love lifted me.
