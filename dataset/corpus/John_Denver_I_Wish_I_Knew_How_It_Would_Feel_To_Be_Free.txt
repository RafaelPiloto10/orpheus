And I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish that I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that I'd like to say  
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
That keeps us apart  
And I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then you'd see and agree  
Every man should be free  
I wish I could live  
Like I'm longin' to live  
And I wish that I could give  
What I'm longin' to give  
And I wish I could do  
All the things I'd like to do  
You know they're still here's quite a few  
Yes sir, and I'm way, way over due  
I wish I could be  
Like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to the sun  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be free, yeah
