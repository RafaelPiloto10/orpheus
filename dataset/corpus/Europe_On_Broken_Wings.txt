Little Jeanie cried, she believed in all his lies  
So much for being good, oh.  
Johnny did not rest he did what he thought was best,  
He did the best he could.  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days.  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you'll have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky  
  
Now he's feeling bad  
His heart is cold it's oh so sad  
Somehow he did her wrong, yeaheah  
Little Jeanie's heart  
Is melting fast oh so fast.  
Now she feels so strong  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days.  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you'll have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you'll have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how.. how you have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...
