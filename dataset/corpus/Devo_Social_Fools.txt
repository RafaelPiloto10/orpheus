If you obey society's rules  
You will be society's fools  
You'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were fools  
You never wanted to listen in school  
Now your mind won't go where you want to take it  
You got a ride but you're not gonna make it  
You'll never catch up!  
Dad, pass the catsup!  
Clean that mess up! Listen up!  
If you obey society's fools  
You'll be society's tools  
And you'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were queer  
You always wanted egg in your beer  
Now your dog won't go  
When you try to make it  
He's got a bone but he's not gonna shake it  
If you take society's tools  
You will make society's rules  
Which you'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
That's all for now  
That's all we know  
This is the end
