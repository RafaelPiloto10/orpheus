There are people that will investigate you  
They'll insinuate, intimidate and complicate you  
Don't ever wait or hesitate to state the fate that awaits those who  
Try to shake or take you  
Don't let them break you  
  
You can do anything you want to do  
It's not wrong what I sing it's true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want to  
  
People that despise you will analyze then criticize you  
They'll scandalize and tell lies until they realize  
You are someone they should have apologized to  
Don't let these people compromise you  
Be wise too  
  
You can do anything you want to do  
It's not wrong what I sing it's true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want to  
  
Hey you you're not their puppet on a string  
You can do everything  
It's true if you really want to  
You can do anything you want  
  
Just like I do  
  
You can do anything you want to do  
It's not wrong when I sing it's true  
You can do anything you want to do  
Do what you want  
  
Hey you  
No can do  
Hey you  
Yes you  
  
Elvis is dead  
The king of Rock'n Roll is dead  
Elvis is dead  
I said one for the money....
