I'm here to testify  
I can't remember why  
Complete or justify my situation.  
  
I don't remember when and I can only half pretend,  
A case of now and then, I just need someone.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I cant wait until tomorrow comes.  
  
Spoke out on compromise, just the ego telling lies.  
Confides and then defies, in case you?'re waiting.  
Guess that it's a time for change  
Remain but change the name.  
This game is where to aim.  
I hear the charge, boy.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way, but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's liberating, but when it rains it pours,  
Degenerating, ain't gonna fight no more.  
  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.
