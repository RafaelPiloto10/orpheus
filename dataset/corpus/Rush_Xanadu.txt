"To seek the sacred river Alph  
To walk the caves of ice  
To break my fast on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise..."  
  
I had heard the whispered tales  
Of immortality  
The deepest mystery  
From an ancient book, I took a clue  
I scaled the frozen mountain tops  
Of eastern lands unknown  
Time and man alone  
Searching for the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
To stand within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste anew the fruits of life  
The last immortal man  
To find the sacred river Alph  
To walk the caves of ice  
Oh, I will dine on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise  
  
A thousand years have come and gone  
But time has passed me by  
Stars stopped in the sky  
Frozen in an everlasting view  
Waiting for the world to end  
Weary of the night  
Praying for the light  
Prison of the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
Held within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste my bitter triumph  
As a mad immortal man  
Nevermore shall I return  
Escape these caves of ice  
For I have dined on honey dew  
And drunk the milk of Paradise
