Since this is what you wanted  
Then I'll just walk away  
You'll have your time to think of all the things and what you need  
While I'm gone and away  
Is this really what you wanted  
Then I will let you go  
I'll be keeping all my fears  
Though I'm drowning in my tears  
With a thought  
Of a life without you  
[Chorus:]  
But if someday you'll need a friend  
I promise I won't let you down  
I'll be there for you  
Right there beside you  
I promise  
Is this really what you needed?  
Then I will say goodbye  
All the memories that we've shared  
Will be running in my head  
I'll be thinking about you  
Just thinking about you  
(Repeat Chorus)  
[Bridge:]  
Coz if one day things don't feel so right  
I am someone you can call  
If you feel you've no one to turn to I'm here  
Coz if this is what you needed  
I won't let you see me cry  
And all my sleepless nights  
I'll be waiting for your call  
I'll be dreaming about you  
Just dreaming about you  
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
