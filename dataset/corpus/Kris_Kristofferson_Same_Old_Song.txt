I was just a young man  
Working steady in a good time band  
Pickin' every single little lick I could  
Just to please the man  
Harlan sang the lead for half  
And we split up the rest  
Hangin' on through the heavy times  
And hopin' for the best  
  
And I can't recall the names of all  
Them places that we played in  
All them squirrely party girls  
And pills we used to pop  
Hardly ever sleepin' in  
Those cheap motels we stayed in  
Hopin' we could take it 'til we'd make it to the top  
  
[Chorus:]  
And them nights, get a little bit brighter  
And them bars just a little bit better  
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter  
But them blues, well it's still the same old song  
  
Now we're stars and shining on  
Them prime time T.V. shows  
Every stranger knows our name  
And every little where we go  
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different  
From the top  
  
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'  
When you drop  
And I've left some of my soul on  
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on  
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could  
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on  
Ever since the first I had  
The worst I had was good  
  
[Chorus]
