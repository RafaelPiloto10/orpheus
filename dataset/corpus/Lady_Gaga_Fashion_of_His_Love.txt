I never was the kind of girl,  
That's naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no!  
I was insecure, insecure!  
But when it comes to you and me  
I can't deny this feeling I'm feeling inside,  
Oh no, I've never been like this before!  
This before, oh, no!  
  
[Chorus]  
I seeing all the signs from above  
I'm going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love!  
Oh yeah  
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss,  
'Cause baby I was born to be his  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love (I love you)  
  
You know that I'd never cheat on a man  
'Cause I'm not like that  
I'm physically crafted to be  
As fitting as McQueen  
But when it comes to clothing a man  
I'm fashionably just designed to be rad  
Oh he's, no words that seem to mean  
What I mean, no no, no!  
No I just can't seem to forget you  
No I can't  
But just as long as I met you  
You're my babe right through  
I was made for you (I was made for you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say I need a strong man  
Not just a friend,  
But baby must have reached his death.  
No more reason to cry or to justify  
How I feel for you  
My love  
I seeing all the signs from above  
I'm going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
  
[Chorus: x2]
