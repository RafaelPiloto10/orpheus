All summer long you smelled like lotion and we made love when we took the
notion  
Summer is gone and it's hard to believe how lonely I am raking up leaves  
Raking up leaves and counting the days  
Yes and counting the nights that you've been away  
The winter winds blow and memories freeze  
I'm missing you and raking up leaves  
[ sax ]  
Expecting the sun just any day now wish you were here to go out and play now  
You say you'll return when they're on the trees  
I'm hungry for you and raking up leaves  
Raking up leaves and counting the days...
