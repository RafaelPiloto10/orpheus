[Verse 1]  
When she told you goodbye you didn't flinch  
When she looked back you didn't even budge an inch  
You stood there like a stone but now that's she's gone  
  
[Chorus]  
How strong are you now without her around  
You can't even keep one little bitty tear from falling down  
Tell me how strong are you now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Before she left you told yourself it can't hurt that much  
Now your double over like you took a punch  
No she ain't coming back tell me how much can you take of that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
What's that rule that you live by, a tough guy never cries  
How strong are you now, without her around  
You can't even keep one little bitty ear from falling down  
Tell me how strong, tell me how strong are you now  
How strong are you now, oh, what's that rule you live by  
You say tough guys never cry how strong are you now
