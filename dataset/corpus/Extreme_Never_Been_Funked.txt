Never Been Funked  
I ain't trying to make no political statement  
I ain't trying to tell you the news of the world  
I ain't one to give intellectual realness  
I just want you to want me the way that I do  
  
Don't it make you feel good, make you feel good?  
Don't it make you feel good?  
  
[Chorus]  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
Never been funked, never been funked  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
  
I don't keep in touch with economical worries  
My interest don't lie in that same old story  
Communicating was never my problem  
I never have to talk to get through to you  
Talk,talk  
  
Do you really want to funk with me?  
Do you really want to funk with me?
