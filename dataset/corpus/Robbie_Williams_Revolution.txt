Don't fight the feeling, relax  
Oh child the knot's in your back  
'Cause you've been holding on  
I feel you when you're reaching out  
  
I'll talk you through memories  
Just keep breathing with me  
It's time to hold my hand  
And walk into the revolution  
  
When there's no one to touch  
And you've been thinking too much  
You only hurt yourself  
When it's all about retribution  
  
I see the pain in your face  
And praying rare for this space  
It's time to lead you on  
C'mon, it's a revolution  
  
When you can't keep on keeping on  
And everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody falls sometimes  
But love shines on  
And on and on and  
  
With love in your eyes and a flame in your heart  
You're gonna find yourself some resolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
Walking with the revolution  
  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Talking about the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Walking with the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Taking you higher  
  
Old love lingers on  
You're just feelin it wrong  
I know you're tired  
But when it's time to sleep you're gone forever  
  
Make friends with your past  
And you can leave it at last  
It's time to find yourself  
Walking with the revolution  
  
And you can keep on keeping on and  
Everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody hurts sometimes  
But love shines on and on and on and  
  
Time and tide's on your side  
There's no need to hide  
I feel your pain  
Don't talk to me about evolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
When you're walking with the revolution  
  
Walking with the revolution  
A million miles with one step  
And you'll find yourself yet  
When you're walking with the revolution  
  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Walking with the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Get on with your revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
It's all about resolution now  
  
Talking about the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Oh oh  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Talking about the revolution
