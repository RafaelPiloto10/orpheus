Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death?  
Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death?  
Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
  
Do you stop take another roller coaster ride  
Do I beg, steal, cheat or lie? Oh my is there life after death?  
Oh I wish I'd never smoked so much  
I wish I'd never felt the Devil's touch  
All that passes through my eyes so fast. Oh my.  
Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death?  
Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death?  
Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
  
It's such a sad sad song  
Mother Nature ain't never wrong  
She always tells you when you're getting on  
Oh my, is there life after death?  
  
I can hardly wait to see my face  
Will I still have one in a different place  
Oh you'll forgive me if I hesitate, but oh my  
Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death? Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
Is there life, is there life?  
Is there life after death? Do you believe? Oh yeah!  
  
Is it any wonder, I feel just a little bit under  
I hear choirs filled with Fenders say return to sender  
Jumping information, I've got hyperventilation  
Will it help me if I walk the streets  
I gotta get down search around feel the ground by my feet  
  
Oh no I never knew just how long this could go  
If only I could go down slow  
I'm gonna shake it, shake it, shake it, is there life after death  
I can't remember when I felt so sick and rough  
And now they're gonna legalize the stuff  
It sure tells you when you've had enough, off the cuff  
  
Is there life, is there life? Is there life after death? Do you believe? Oh
yeah!  
  
Is there life, is there life? Is there life after death? Do you believe,  
I've run out of breath.
