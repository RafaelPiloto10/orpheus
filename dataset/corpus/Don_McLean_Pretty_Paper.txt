Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darlin from you  
Pretty pencils to write I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Crowded streets, busy feet, hustle by him  
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh  
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk  
Hoping that you won't pass him on by  
  
Should you stop? Better not, much too busy  
You better hurry, my how time does fly  
And in the distance the ringing of laughter  
And in the midst of the laughter he cries  
  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Oooh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
