My hands are shaking as I'm sadly learning  
The truth behind your innocent disguise  
You never thought I knew that you had been untrue  
But I once saw the devil somewhere in your eyes  
  
And now you got the nerve  
To ask me where I'm going  
And I don't believe I'd tell you if I knew  
I'll be gone when the sun comes up tomorrow  
I believe it's time to say goodbye to you  
And it sure smells like snow in Bossier City  
But there ain't no weather quite as cold as you  
I'd sooner stand in mother nature's anger  
Than to spend another lonely night with you  
  
I'm talking but I'm feeling  
You're not listenin'  
My words they just fall  
Heavy on the floor  
Yes it's true that you knew  
I would not stay forever  
And you won't see me cryin'  
When I walk out your door  
And now you got the nerve...
