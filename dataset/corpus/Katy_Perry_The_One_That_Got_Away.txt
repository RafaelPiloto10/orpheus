Summer after high school, when we first met  
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead  
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos  
  
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof  
Talk about our future like we had a clue  
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
In another life, I would be your girl  
We keep all our promises, be us against the world  
In another life, I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away  
The one that got away  
  
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash  
Never one without the other, we made a pact  
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa  
  
Someone said you had your tattoo removed  
Saw you downtown, singing the blues  
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The one, the one, the one  
The one that got away  
  
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no  
Can't replace you with a million rings, no  
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa  
Cause now I pay the price  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The one (the one)  
The one (the one)  
The one (the one)  
  
In another life, I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away  
The one that got away
