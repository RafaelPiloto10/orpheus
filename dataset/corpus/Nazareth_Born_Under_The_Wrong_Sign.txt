Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong sign  
Every day turns out the same  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Sorry is no way that I feel  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Singin' my blues is for real  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
  
Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong  
Every day turns out the same  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign
