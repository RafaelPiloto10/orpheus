I've always said that I believe anything can happen  
Lately I've been wonderin' if that's really true  
For a boy, time can be a lovely dance  
Then suddenly the music can fade  
Leave the man alone and dreamless  
Till he only sees that he's used up all his chances after all  
'Til now only a miracle could do to save the man I've turned into  
Won't somebody let me know, where's my miracle  
Love, it always seemed so easy  
Just like a child who plays with imaginary friends  
I could see the face of someone I believe  
But only in the words of a song  
Then she came along and got me dreamin'  
That's when you began and when I held you, I held a miracle in my hands  
'Til now only a miracle could do, I've found the boy I was in you  
You've come to let me know there are miracles  
And now only a miracle could do what I have finally found in you  
I've come to let you know I believe that  
Miracles can happen in the end
