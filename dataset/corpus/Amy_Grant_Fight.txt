You know some days I like me, some days I don't  
Some days I try with passion, sometimes I won't.  
I might just hold my guard up, and lock my heart up tight  
But it's the door that's open letting in the light  
There's a battle raging inside of me  
It's a holy struggle, and it won't let go of me  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
I used to sit and ponder if I'd be fine  
If Jesus lived His own life and I lived mine  
But love is such a magnet, it pulled me night and day  
Until my needy heart just couldn't stay away  
Life can drive you crazy or just about  
But even when it's most frustrating, this kid's not walking out  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it  
No, no, no  
I don't want to waste my life hiding  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
I've made up my mind now, I don't want to lose out  
(Unguarded)  
Beginning to see now,What the fight is about  
(Unguarded heart)  
I gotta stay open, keep defenses all down  
(Unguarded)  
Don't want to be hiding when the love comes round  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it  
No, no, no  
I don't want to waste my life hiding  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
...
