I just want to see  
What it's like to be  
Caught in your eyes  
I wish you'd talk to me  
I'm not cut out to be the one lonely child  
  
I always wanted a youger sister  
One who'd always be drawn to me  
I'm going crazy tonight  
I'm going crazy tonight  
'cause you're all I want to do anytime  
  
Baby you're all I wana do  
With my time  
Baby you're all I want to do anytime  
Baby you're all I want  
You're all I really want to do  
  
When you stay next to me  
It's not so hard to see  
What's burning my eyes  
It's always hard to see  
When you're cut out be the one lonely child  
  
I look at you and your younger sister  
There's always something that smile on you  
I know you're crazy tonight  
I know you're crazy tonight  
Do you in the morning  
  
Do you up right  
Don't want to stop  
'til the middle of the night  
Every single minute  
Baby while I'm thinking of you  
(anytime) I've got a thing about you  
(anytime) I can't live without you  
  
Why why why why  
Baby baby baby you're all I need  
Maybe baby baby I'll be thinking of you  
'cause you're all I want to do  
  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do
