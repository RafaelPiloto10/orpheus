Johnny get your girl  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Say you'll like to hold her  
  
Johnny get your girl  
Walk her in the moonlight  
If you've got no moonlight  
Talk about a June night  
  
Don't wait for introductions  
Don't be so formal  
Just step right up and do the thing that's normal  
Johnny get your girl  
  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Get a little bolder  
Give romance a whirl  
Don't let another Johnny get your girl  
  
Don't wait for introductions  
Don't be so formal  
Just step right up and do the thing that's normal  
John get that girl  
  
Tap her on the shoulder  
Get a little bolder  
Give romance a whirl  
Don't you let another Johnny get your girl
