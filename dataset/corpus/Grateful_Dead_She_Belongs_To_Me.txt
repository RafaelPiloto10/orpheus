She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.  
Takes the dark out of the nighttime, she paints the daytime black.  
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees.  
But you will wind up peeking through a key hole, down upon your bended knees.  
  
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall.  
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.  
She wears an Egyptian ring, that sparkles before she speaks.  
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.  
  
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes.  
For Halloween but her a trumpet, and for Christmas, buy her drums.  
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.  
Takes the dark out of the nighttime, you know she paints the daytime black.
