Mama's got a squeeze box  
She wears on her chest  
Daddy come home  
And never get no rest  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause she's playing all night  
And the music's all right  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
  
Well, the kid won't eat  
And the dog won't sleep  
No escape from the music  
On the whole damn street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She goes in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She goes squeeze me  
Come on and squeeze me  
Come on and tease me like you do  
I'm so in love with you  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
Come on she should play that thing  
  
She goes in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out  
  
[Chorus x2]
