Went to the fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Said she'd take a look at my palm  
Said "Son do you feel kind of warm?"  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said "You're in love."  
  
Said it could not be so,  
Not with all the girls I know.  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes.  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love
