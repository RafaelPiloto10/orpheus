[Violent J]  
You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this,  
only I never really thought about how horrible it really is,  
laying in a coffin, in the pitch black dark,  
The only sound being that of my heart if I'm alive.  
But I've got no pulse or even breath for days,  
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze,  
But I do recall my funeral, them lowering me in,  
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in.  
I tried to move my fingers or somethin, got nothin,  
But dirt hitting the top from them shoveling, n I'm fucked.  
It's been at least two weeks but I don't keep time,  
I just lay here motionless in this rotting body of mine,  
I tried fantasy realms and dreaming my way out,  
It only leads to mind panicing and torturing thoughts about running and
breathing  
will it ever really happen again?  
Please God, heaven or hell just let something begin
