Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Come  
  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Please don't follow me along  
When you read this I'll be gone  
  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in, to tell you why  
  
Ask the mountains  
Wild woods, highlands  
Ask the green in the woods and the trees  
The cold breeze coming in from the sea  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in, to tell you why  
  
Tell the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?  
  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?
