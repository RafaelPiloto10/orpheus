Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
He was born the King Solomon  
He was a wise and had a thousand wives  
He was a righteous and feeling judge  
He was the king and the father of the people  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Two young women came with a child  
Claiming I'm the mother of this child  
He said: Bring me a sword,  
Divide the baby in two  
Oh, in two!  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
The real mother cried: Don't!  
The other one said: Divide!  
Everybody knew who was really true  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
How can the people divide a little child ?  
How can the people divide such a little heart ?  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem  
Jerusalem, Jerusalem
