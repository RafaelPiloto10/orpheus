Guardian of the lies of faith  
Darker now this tale of hate  
Look into the eyes of death  
Buried in another's flesh  
  
Fate guide my hand as I ride hell's wind  
Hole in the sky where the blackest spirits rage  
  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
  
Now you live and now you die  
Across the lake of gorgon's eyes  
Crimson blood, a hero's quest  
Atone for death with still more death  
Hate guides my hand as I smile within  
Hole in the sky where the blackest spirits rage  
  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
  
Right's on the side of our twin thrones of war  
Bold are the crowns in their hands  
Bright are the signs of the godhead  
Justice is found where the proud eagles reign  
  
Blind persuasion, crack the holy tearless eyes  
Will the true kings return, thunder greets you with a sword  
  
Guardian of the lies of faith  
Harken now this tale of hate  
Noble deeds were done this day  
Welcome home your king betrayed  
  
Fate guides my hand as I plunge this blade  
Hole in your heart where the blackest furies rage  
  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
Through the ring of fire  
Through the ring of pain  
Through the ring of fire, I am born again  
  
Hope is rising with the sound of our glory  
We will see where we lie  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, aha ah ah ah, etc.
