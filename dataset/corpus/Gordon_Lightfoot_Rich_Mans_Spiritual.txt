Gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to help me home  
I'm gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to get me home  
And when I get my heavenly gown  
And I lay my burden down  
I'm gonna get me a long white robe  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
And when I get my slippers of gold  
Then the Lord will have my soul  
I'm gonna get me two golden slippers  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
And when I get my silvery wings  
Then an angel choir will sing  
I'm gonna get me two wings of silver  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
And when I get my trouble and woe  
Then homeward I will go  
I'm gonna get a little trouble  
And woe to get me home  
  
I'm gonna find me a smilin' angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
And when he takes me by the hand  
I know the Lord will understand  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home
