If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was a gouger  
gouge would I wish for  
If I was a fisherman  
fish would i fish for  
If I was a french whore  
frenchies I'd dish for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Turkeys are for flyin'  
chickens are for eatin'  
I'm all for fun  
fun's forbidden  
forbidden's forgotten  
and forgotten's for gettin'  
I wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Buzzards are for circling  
circles are for heroes  
Heroes for floatin'  
fiddles to Nero  
Fingers for countin'  
numbers for zero  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
I'd wear wood teeth  
If I was a policeman  
I'd walk me a stone beat  
If I was a singer  
I'd stop right now  
I wish I had a dollar a day
