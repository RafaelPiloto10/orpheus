I'm wandering the town all light off  
I don't know where I'm leaving for  
The muddy rain start to fall on me  
And I'm walking down to subway  
  
I can't see all around me  
Get me out of here  
Talk to me if someone is in this darkness  
  
I'm out of my head  
Out of my mind  
Tell me where I'm what's going on, oh please  
  
Something is hiding me off  
Is this the wall of my heart  
  
I have been lost so many things I've got  
For long time I've been searching for my way  
  
I carry on, carry on  
I'm so spiting to their ugly heart  
To this so stood world  
  
Everyday I forbear to fall the tears  
Don't want to be down  
  
Every night hurt is so deep in my heart  
Is this my life  
Oh! show me please  
  
The wall close to me  
It's so painful, stop it!  
Is there someone to help me  
Please get me out of here  
Oh! get me out!  
  
Dead or alive, no place to run  
Get it settled once and for all  
Dead or alive, can't live in the past  
Only one way to live  
  
Give me heart finishing blow  
If I could only turn my back  
Let me do screaming high  
Squeeze the throes of death for me  
  
It comes here the blame I'd done before  
Fall on me as if it grow in my brain  
The ugly side of myself tears me up  
At this time I can't go back  
  
Give my heart finishing blow  
If I couldn't run from the past  
Let me do screaming high  
Disclose the feeling inside of me  
  
Dead or alive, can't live in the past  
Only one way to live  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
The fight is over  
The mad rain had gone past over me  
Blood is flowing down  
Tear is flowing down  
Now I'm alive and I'm walking to town again
