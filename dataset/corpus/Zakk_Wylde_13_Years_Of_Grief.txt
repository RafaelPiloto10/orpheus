You're so fuckin' tough, so motherfuckin' bad  
13 years of grief is all your folks ever had  
Just an ignorant cunt, talkin' such shit  
Tryin' to act like a man, you little fuckin' punk kid  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now  
Day of court, day of fear, in walks the judge  
Half a year nothing less, no he wouldn't budge  
Hand over your belongings and your motherfuckin' soul  
That's the joy of life, six months in the hole  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now  
You raped your mother, yeah, you beat her down  
Jesus can't protect you when your brain's unfound  
Once so fuckin' tough, so motherfuckin' bad  
13 years of grief is all your folks ever had  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now  
Yeah  
Son, look at you now
