If you want to hang out, you've gotta take her out, cocaine  
If you want to get down, get down on the ground, cocaine  
  
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,  
Cocaine  
  
If you got bad news, you want to kick them blues, cocaine  
When your day is done, and you want to run cocaine  
  
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,  
Cocaine  
  
If your thing is gone, and you want to ride on, cocaine  
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine  
  
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,  
Cocaine  
  
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,  
Cocaine
