Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
I lay my heart on you and you can show the way  
I give my everlasting love until my dying day  
Take this lonely soul , the water or the wine  
A chance to make you mine  
I lay my body on the line  
  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
My life was emptiness until you came along  
I nearly fell apart , you took my heart and made me strong  
I need all of you to get me through the night  
A chance to see the light  
I lay my body on the line
