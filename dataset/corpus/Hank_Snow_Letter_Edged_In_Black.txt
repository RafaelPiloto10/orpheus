I was standing by the window yesterday morning,  
Without a thought of worry or of care,  
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway,  
With such a happy look and jolly air.  
  
[Chorus]  
As I heard the postman whistling yester morning,  
Coming down the pathway with his pack,  
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,  
And then he said "Good morning to you, Jack."  
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
With trembling hand I took the letter from him,  
I broke the seal and this is what it said:  
"Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you!  
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!"  
  
"The last words that your mother ever uttered  
'Tell my boy I want him to come back,'  
My eyes are blurred, my poor old heart is breaking,  
For I'm writing you this letter edged in black."  
  
I bow my head in sorrow and in silence,  
The sunshine of my life it all has fled,  
Since the postman brought that letter yester morning  
Saying,"Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!:"  
  
"Those angry words, I wish I'd never spoken,  
You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack?  
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking  
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black."
