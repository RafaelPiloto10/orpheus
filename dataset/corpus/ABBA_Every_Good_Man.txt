Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true
