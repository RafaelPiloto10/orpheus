I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me  
We had a fight last night about something or other  
But it can't be too important if we love one another  
True love always seems to take a little bit longer  
But every time we break up, we make up a little bit stronger  
I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me  
Let me tell you know  
I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me qo  
Me without you, you without me  
Me without you, you without me  
Me without you, you without me'
