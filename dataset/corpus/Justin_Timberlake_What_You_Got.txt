The way your body keeps moving  
Is something that makes me weak  
Lets start our own little secrets  
For just you and me to keep  
Too late to come off shy now  
You've already gone this far  
So baby make your move, take charge  
Show me what you got for me  
  
Oh no  
(girl)  
Is that your hands, (your hands), rubbing on me  
Oh no  
(girl)  
Oh no  
(girl)  
Is that your hands, (your hands), ooh on me  
Oh no  
(girl)  
Is that your hands, (your hands), rubbing on me  
If so  
(girl)  
If that's your hands, (your hands), then tell me what you got for me
