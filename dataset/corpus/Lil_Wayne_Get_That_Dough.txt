Bitch, Bitch  
  
[Chorus: Baby (Cristale)]  
(Get that dough)  
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, see'mon  
(Get that dough)  
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro  
(Get that dough)  
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, Wooo  
(Get that dough)  
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro  
  
[Lil Wayne]  
I pull up slow, chrome flashing  
Lil daddy in a long Cabbi  
Big hat pimp strong daddy  
Got my hoes on my arm daddy  
Ain't that amazing, specially when I'm blazing that dro  
Earthly green, purple weed, purple V,  
With purple seats, murck the streets  
And I see ya in that Gucci skirt ya sweet  
But later on I want to hurt ya so holla back hoe  
I know ya will, get ya ass over here  
And take off my polar bear  
I'm the coldest player of most my age  
Quote my age, 19 but my money's much old  
And shorty got crazy paper  
Cash Money's my army, my navy paper  
Understand, Weezy is made of paper  
I got "Baby" paper  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Cristale]  
Floss our bitch, or get tossed out  
Stunner time criss-crossed out  
Birdman the bad bitches bossed out  
So fly nigga we don't walk out  
Time to get Nina Rossed out  
I'ma let the heat speak, see I'm talked out  
What's the motherfucking talk bout  
Get you niggas chalked out  
Chi-town and Birdman show you what that fucking hawk bout  
  
[Baby]  
You can shine like stunna (Papi it's all gravy)  
I bought the Rover for me and bought the Benz for my ladies  
See I, wipe ya down, I shine ya up  
And put the rims on the whip then diamond'd up  
It's the m-uh-m-uh-man, that I hustle for grams  
Me, Ta', and Cris' with a blunt in my hand  
See I come through shining, known big tymin  
Red Caddi truck, nigga I'm grinding  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Tateeze]  
I come Harley D, black bike all chrome  
Your queen is home, daddy tell 'em where they went from  
  
[Baby]  
See I'ma slide on through, then I stash the loot  
Who washed the coupe, ma look I know what to do  
  
[Tateeze]  
Got the suit you to wear some pumps on  
Matching the car, matching my bra, shit nigga pimping is hard  
  
[Baby]  
I jock that, so wipe a nigga down  
Let's dribble on a hoe, bitch time to go  
  
[Tateeze]  
The Caddi do me pop, the coupe is hot  
The groupies flock, and case me out my Gucci socks  
Yeah, we get that dough, Tatee' watch me drop these  
You got me, can I get the car keys  
  
[Baby]  
See I wipe a bitch down, then dribble on a hoe  
And I touch her from her head, from her waist, to her toes  
Pop up in the Lexus with the mink on the floor  
Rocked out Nexus 2K bird hoe, Wooo!  
  
[Chorus]
