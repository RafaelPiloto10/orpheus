They say it's me,  
That makes you do things  
You might not have done,  
If I was away  
And that's it's me,  
That likes to talk to you  
And watches you,  
As you walk away  
Don't say it's useless,  
Don't say forget it  
Don't bring me wishes,  
Of silly dreams  
Just say it's all,  
From too much freedom  
Too many fingers,  
And to anything  
They say it's you,  
That washes the weary  
And brings the night into the day  
If you won't notice,  
How can I show you  
All of you worries,  
Have all gone away  
Don't leave me lonely,  
Don't leave me unhappy  
Just bring me up into your fate  
If you don't need me,  
Then don't deceive me  
Letting my freedom turn into stone  
Just be my angel,  
If you love me  
Be my angel,  
In the night  
Be my angel,  
'Cause you need me  
Be my angel,  
And treat me right  
Don't say you love me,  
If you don't need me  
Don't send me roses,  
On your behalf  
Just take me down,  
And walk through your river  
Down the middle,  
And make it last  
Holding on to you,  
Holding on to me  
Holding on tight,  
'Till my love is crossed  
Don't say it's useless,  
And don't say forget it  
You are my spirit,  
Now you are gone
