I got a four leaf clover  
And it ain't done one single lick of good  
I'm still a drunk I'm still a loser  
Living in a lousy neighborhood  
  
I got a real live horseshoe  
And I hung it upside down above my door  
But it ain't done nothing to attract you  
So I don't know what the hell it's for  
  
Why don't you come over  
I'll show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin' to kid  
I'm not the kind of guy you'd go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I ain't got no hope of getting you  
  
I gotta oooooooooo  
Oh I got a lucky silver dollar  
My granddaddy gave it to me now he's dead  
At times like this I wish that I could join him  
So I can stop this pounding in my head  
  
Why don't you come over  
I'll show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin' to kid  
I'm not the kind of guy you go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I ain't got no hope of getting you  
Well I ain't got no hope of getting you  
No I ain't got no hope of getting you
