[4 Fizzle:]  
Be clear you already know what it is  
Meanin the booth is alive and well  
4 Fizzle my man Fabolous right now  
Paul Cain hes in the building  
Street Fam  
Its about to go down  
Fab please please bless it  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Yes sir  
Got my homie Paul Cain in the house  
You know what I mean?  
Reppin that Street Fam  
You know how we do  
Check it out Yo  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Straight out of Brooklyn a baby mama snatcher named Ghetto  
Invisible set glow  
Full clip to let go  
Back in the metro  
Fresh off the jet though  
Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show  
Gangsta but i'm the flyest you ever met ho  
Button up etro  
The Air Jordan Retro  
Million dollar neck row  
Got homie upset so  
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo'  
Told you from the get go  
Ya'll can't deny it  
I just supply it  
For those who buy it  
Now I ride by it  
It might start a riot  
Chicks won't quiet  
Long enough to try it  
Dirt they throwin' mud slides on my name  
They never seen this kind of stud size in a chain  
I analyze that like i'm Billy Crystal  
I'm forced to move around with this nine milly pistol  
  
[4 Fizzle:]  
What more do we need to say man?
