Gonna get you while you sleep  
Give you a dream you can keep  
To yourself little mama gonna make you feel better  
  
I'm your mystery man in a gold Lincoln  
Ain't no reason to do any second thinkin'  
About it child  
  
Midnight ride I'm gonna shake ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna break ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna take you on a  
Midnight ride  
  
Meet you little girl back at my hotel  
Between you and me we're really gonna give 'em hell  
  
I got something mighty special up my sleeve  
All you got to do is just say please  
  
Midnight ride I'm gonna shake ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna break ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna take you on a  
Midnight ride
