You say you don't want to run and hide  
A face that no one knows  
And everyone you meet, you're gonna show  
You're nobody's slave, nobody's chains are holdin' you  
You hold your fist up high,  
And rule the zoo  
  
Oh, you just got to be  
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me  
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody to cry out  
  
I want to be somebody,  
Be somebody soon  
I want to be somebody  
Be somebody too  
  
You say you don't want to starve  
Or take the table crumbs that fall  
You don't want to beg or plead at all  
You don't want no nine to five  
Your fingers to the bone  
You don't want the rock piles bloody stones  
  
Oh, you just got to be  
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me  
Cause I , I got the guts to be somebody to cry out  
  
I want to be somebody,  
Be somebody soon  
I want to be somebody  
Be somebody too  
  
I want shiny cars and dirty money  
Lots of rock and roll  
I will live in fame and die in flames  
I'm never getting old  
  
I want to be somebody,  
Be somebody soon  
I want to be somebody  
Be somebody too  
  
I gonna be somebody  
I gonna be somebody
