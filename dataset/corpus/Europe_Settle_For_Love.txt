Don't misunderstand me I was just a little kid  
Thinking that the street life was the only way to live  
Always holding out for another thrill  
  
We've come a long long way  
So tell me why can't we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why can't we settle for love before it's too late  
  
Whatever it is you think you're missing  
Time to let your heart go  
'Cause when you've walked this kind of distance  
We can't fool each other anymore  
Maybe there is a light that won't go out  
  
We've come a long long way  
So tell me why can't we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why can't we settle for love before it's too late
