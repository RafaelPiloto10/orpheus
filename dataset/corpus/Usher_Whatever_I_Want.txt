[Usher talking]  
(Yeah...)  
  
[Usher]  
If you, only knew (ha)  
I already sized you up  
Sittin' next to me lookin' so tough  
And you're, fixin' your hair runnin' ya game  
  
Telling me I only want one thing  
Girl! Sincerity is what you need for now  
In awhile I'll do the  
And it's almost unfair to me  
What you want say baby you're ready to see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's so clear to me,  
Is it every word I hear you speak is  
Whatever I wanna do  
It's whatever I wanna do  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever you say it's just giving me  
Whatever I want baby I can do  
Whatever I want  
  
[Usher]  
You can't get enough conversation I feel your touch  
You're losing point trying to play the role  
Let's keep it cool not sexual  
Girl I know how you feel  
  
But you don't want it for real  
It's whatever I wanna do  
You don't even know what you've gotten into  
  
[Chorus]  
It's so clear to me,  
Is it every word I hear you speak is  
Whatever I wanna do  
It's whatever I wanna do  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever I - Whatever I wanna do,  
It's whatever I wanna do baby  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever you say it's just giving me  
Whatever I want baby I can do  
Whatever I want  
  
[Usher]  
It just ain't right  
You're feeling so frustrated  
You can't stop to feel love  
Being this close to me  
  
Girl you know that  
Everything you need is right here,  
Tonight (tonight), when we (when we), do what (do whatever), ever we want to
(we want to)  
(Oh yeah, whatever I want)  
  
[Mike Jones]  
(Mike Jones!)  
What, ever I want whatever I need  
She'll do whatever it takes to give it to me  
She don't trip don't talk cuz she know I'll kick her out  
  
And when I get bored bring her back to my house  
I'm Mike Jones! (WHO?) Mike Jones! (Jones)  
That'll hit a chick quick and make her walk home  
Because whatever I wanna do I'mma do to you  
  
I'm a grown man I do what I wanna do  
So until you figure it out I'm kickin ya out  
Because I feel good single I don't need no spouse  
I'm a bachelor who just got his bachelor's degree  
  
So if pretty, sexy, and thick, come holla at me  
281-330-8004 that's my cell phone number hit me up on the low  
281-330-8004 that's my cell phone number hit me up on the low  
(Mike Jones! Who?)  
(Swishahouse! Yeah!)  
  
[Usher]  
(Whatever I want)  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
It's so clear to me,  
Is it every word I hear you speak is  
Whatever I wanna do  
It's whatever I wanna do  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever I want I can do to you  
Whatever you say it's just giving me  
Whatever I want baby I can do  
Whatever I want  
  
[Repeat: x 2]  
(Whatever I want)
