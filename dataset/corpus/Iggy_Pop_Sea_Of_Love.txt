Do you remember when we met  
That's the day I knew you were my pet  
I wanna tell you  
How much I love you  
Come with me  
  
My love To the sea  
The sea of love  
I wanna tell you  
Just how much I love you  
Come with me To the sea Of love  
Do you remember when we met  
  
Oh that's the day I knew you were my pet  
I wanna tell you Oh how much I love you  
Come with me To the sea Of love  
Come with me My love To the sea  
The sea of love  
I wanna tell you Just how much I love you  
I wanna tell you Oh how much I love you
