Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee,  
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see.  
It did rain all night the day I left, the weather was bone dry.  
The sun was so hot I froze myself, Suzanne, don't you go on and cry.  
I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me,  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee.  
  
Well I had myself a dream the other night when everything was still,  
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne, she was coming around the hill.  
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye.  
I said, that I come from Dixie land, Suzanne, don't you break down and cry.  
I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me,  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee.
