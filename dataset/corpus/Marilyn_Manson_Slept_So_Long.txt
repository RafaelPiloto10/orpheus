Walking, waiting alone without a care  
Hoping and hating the things that I can't bear  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up? Well did you? Well did you?  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
I'm taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Walking, waiting alone without a care  
Hoping and hating the things that I can't bear  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up? Well did you? I hate you  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
I'm taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
I've slept so long without you  
It's tearing me apart too  
How'd it get this far  
Playing games with this old heart?  
  
I've killed a million petty souls  
But I couldn't kill you  
I've slept so long without you  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
(Touching you makes me die inside)
