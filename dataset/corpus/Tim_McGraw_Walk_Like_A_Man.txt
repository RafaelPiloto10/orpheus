In the fights they had he'd cover up his ears  
Thought big boys don't cry, fight back all the tears  
Mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  
In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace  
His old man woke him up to help him find the car  
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  
He swore that he was quitting, and then he'd start to cry  
And though the boy knew the truth, sometimes he'd still believe that lie  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
All you do is crawl when you want to run  
God gave boys their mammas  
'Cause they always see their promise  
And they help them understand  
How to walk like man  
Walk like a man  
  
They moved a lot of places, they never settled down  
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town  
He'd always tell his friends, "My daddy's sick today"  
Said he's be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say:  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
Crawl before you walk boy, walk before you run  
Come on stand up straight, I'm proud of you, take my hand  
I know you can  
Walk like a man  
Walk like a man  
  
Your daddy's demons are callin' your name  
Don't you listen to you 'em cause they got no claim  
Temptations may come that ain't no sin  
You get stronger every time that you don't give in  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of son  
You can't undo what has been done  
You'll have to retrace his footsteps through the sand  
And pray you find the love of a girl  
Take her by the hand and walk on  
Walk like a man
