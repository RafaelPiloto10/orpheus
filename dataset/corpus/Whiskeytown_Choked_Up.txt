I don't know why we can't talk  
Every time we try we get choked up  
Running with the feelings that gets caught in your head  
'Til I can't remember what it was we said  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
  
I don't know why we can't win  
Every time we lose, we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I don't need another who wouldn't understand  
  
Take myself with thoughts of leaving  
Running out of things left to believe in  
Running out of money and time  
Running out of money and time  
You won't be mine  
  
I don't know why we can't win  
Every time we lose, we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I don't need another who wouldn't understand  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?
