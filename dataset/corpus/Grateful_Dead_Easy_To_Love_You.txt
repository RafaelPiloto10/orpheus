Good, good morning so good to see you  
Weren't just a dream of mine  
Real as a raven, real as thunder  
Real as the sun shinin'  
But still so very undefined  
Can't imagine what's  
Behind those sleepy eyes  
Little stranger, don't try to hide now  
You look so young when you're afraid  
There is no danger but from the Devil  
He may want you but I'm in His way  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
And come the moon rise, when the dew falls  
Don't be the sun that fades away  
Don't leave me darkness  
She is no lover, she hides the day  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you
