We were standing  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
  
Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin Border  
There was this Indian tribe  
They found two babies in the woods  
White babies  
One of them was named Elizabeth  
She was the fairer of the two  
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie  
Having never seen white girls before  
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes  
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth  
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway  
Became known forever as Lake Marie  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
Many years later I found myself talking to this girl  
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie  
The wind was blowing especially through her hair  
There was four italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill  
And Man, they was ssssssssizzlin'  
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada  
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish  
Whatever seemed easier  
That night she fell asleep in my arms  
Humming the tune to "Louie Louie'  
Aah baby, We gotta go now.  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
The dogs were barking as the cars were parking  
The loan sharks were sharking the narcs were narcing  
Practically everyone was there  
In the parking lot by the forest preserve  
The police had found two bodies  
Nay, naked bodies  
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object  
Saw it on the news On the TV news in a black and white video  
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?  
Shadows, Shadows that's exactly what it looks like  
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed  
Slammed up against the banks of Old Lake Marie, Marie  
  
We were standing  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Peaceful waters  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Peaceful waters  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Peaceful waters  
Standing by peaceful waters  
Peaceful waters  
Aah baby, we gotta go now
