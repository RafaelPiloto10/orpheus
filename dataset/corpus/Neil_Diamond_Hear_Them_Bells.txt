Hear them bells, the story of our love  
Hear them bells from up above  
My darling, I need you, more each day  
I'd be contented dear  
If only you would say  
I'll be yours forever, sweetheart  
Our love is real, we'll never ever part  
To be with you, love is my one desire  
And if you'll leave me  
You'll set my soul on fire  
Hear them bells, the story of our love  
Hear them bells, the story of our love  
Hear them bells, the story's in their sound  
Hear them bells, I'm heaven bound  
To be with you, love ,is my one desire  
And if you'll leave me  
You'll set my soul on fire  
Hear them bells, the story of our love  
Hear them bells, the story of our love
