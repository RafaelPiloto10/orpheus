Every captain must steer the wheel, Not by choice but from the voice  
That's in his ear, I have lived long and I've done much wrong  
But I've survived through my lies, I'm still here, so all you people  
Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on  
Yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me  
Well I felt fire and I got tired of running from the truth  
And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool  
So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you  
I have lived on, yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me  
There were times I had enough, I almost gave it up  
But you reached out your heart to me, look what you've done now  
I've become the best, oh, I'm the best I can be, oh, oh, oh  
You've returned your love, the gift of love, yes, you gave this gift to me
