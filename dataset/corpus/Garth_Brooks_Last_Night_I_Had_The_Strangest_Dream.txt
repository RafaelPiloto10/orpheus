[Chorus]  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I ever dreamed before  
'Cause I dreamed the world  
Had all agreed to put an end to war  
  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the papers they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
  
And when the papers were all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads  
And grateful prayers were prayed  
  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
And swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
  
[Chorus]
