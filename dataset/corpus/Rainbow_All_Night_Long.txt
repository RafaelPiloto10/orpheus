You're walking up with your eyes on me  
It's looking good but I just don't know  
I need a girl who can keep her head  
All Night Long  
You didn't come just to see the show  
I guess you know what you want to see  
The way you smile lets me know I can't go wrong  
  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
I want to make you mine  
  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
  
I saw you standing down by the stage  
Your Black stockings and your see through dress  
Your mouth is open but I don't want to hear ya  
Say good night  
  
You're sorta young  
But you're over age  
I don't care cause I like your style  
Don't know about your brain  
But you look alright  
  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
I want to make you mine  
  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
  
Your mind is dirty  
But your hands are clean  
You show the class  
But you're left alone  
I know I can't stand another night  
(on my own)  
Hey girl would you like some wine  
What's your name?  
Are you by yourself?  
Are you the one?  
But you say can I take you home  
  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
I want to make you mine  
  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)  
I want to love you (all night long)  
I want to be with you (all night long)
