It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
From the 1950's wearing those big pearls  
I'll cook you breakfast  
Coffee on your desk, yes  
I might burn your toast  
But baby, I'm still the bestest  
  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
On the colored tv, it was a new world  
The dick Van Dyke Show  
We're Cher and Bono  
The way I sing 'i Got You Babe'  
Makes you say "oh no"  
Cause you're the class president  
Without Jackie O  
And I'm singing 'Happy Birthday'  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
One, this is not a school girl crush, no  
Two, this is not puppy love, uh-uh  
It's the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby  
  
One, this is not a school girl thing, no  
Two, what about the diamond ring? Uh-uh  
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit  
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby  
  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
  
You make me wanna be like one of those girls  
Calendar pin-up queen in platinum curls  
I'll do my summer pose  
Golden sand between my toes  
You can pack my favorite snack  
A Veuve Clicquot and Ho Ho's  
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home  
While I'm singing for the soldiers  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
One, this is not a school girl crush, no  
Two, this is not puppy love, uh-uh  
It's the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby  
  
One, this is not a school girl thing, no  
Two, what about the diamond ring? Uh-uh  
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit  
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby  
Baby, baby  
  
And if I call you on the telephone  
I might overdose  
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
  
This is not a school girl crush  
This is not puppy love  
It's the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby?  
  
One, this is not a school girl crush, no  
Two, this is not puppy love, uh-uh  
It's the real thing  
When you told me you loved me  
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby  
  
One, this is not a school girl thing, no  
Two, what about the diamond ring? Uh-uh  
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit  
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby  
  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love  
It's not puppy love  
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
