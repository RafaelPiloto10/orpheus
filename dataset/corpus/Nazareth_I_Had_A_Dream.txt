I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I saw the mission band, playing on the green  
It was the saddest thing, I have ever seen  
What did it mean, what did it all mean?  
  
And in my dream, in my same dream  
I saw the soldiers marching, on the green  
The band played a funeral march  
Many a tear was seen  
All in my dream, all in my dream  
  
Lead  
  
I heard the lesson read, I heard the choir  
I saw the falling leaves, landing everywhere  
I saw the family gathered, crying in despair  
I was not there, I was not there
