It's four o' clock in the mornin'  
And the daylight's creepin' in  
And I'm lyin' awake in bed  
And outside my window  
The rain's just pourin' down  
And there's a pain inside my head, oh yeah  
I looked hard into the mirror  
Took some water in my hands  
And threw it on my face  
But your memory won't fade away  
I see you everywhere  
Around this empty space  
This night's too long, fadin' fast  
I tell myself, this pain won't last  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin' my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, yeah  
It tore me apart and I still can't sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now I'm lyin' on a bed of nails  
But it's nothin' but a flesh wound  
Better pull myself together  
Gotta hold my head up high  
That's what I've got to do  
No damage done  
But deep inside my heart  
Who am I tryin' to fool  
It's over now, it's all in the past  
I tell myself, this pain won't last  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin, my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, oh  
It tore me apart and I still can't sleep, no, no  
I've got no choice, I must be strong  
Can't lie here thinkin' about it all night long  
It's nothin' but a flesh wound  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin' my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, oh  
And it tore me apart but I still can't sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now I'm lyin' on a bed of nails  
It's just a flesh wound, oh  
I got to be strong  
It's just a flesh wound, babe  
It tore me apart oh, at last  
It's a flesh wound  
Nothing but a flesh wound, oh  
It cuts me deep, yeah
