Come the morning I'll be far from here  
Slowly rising in another sphere  
  
Old world goodbye cause I'll be  
Home in the sky in the morning bye bye  
  
Stars are crying over my old house  
But I'm still breathing happy above the clouds  
  
Home  
Home at last because  
All of the bad times are past  
  
Music is a lady that I still love  
Cause she gives me the air that I breathe  
  
Music is a lady that I still need  
Cause she brings me the food that I eat  
  
Come the morning I'll be far from here  
Slowly rising in another sphere  
Home, world goodbye  
Cause Ill be home in the sky in the morning  
Bye bye
