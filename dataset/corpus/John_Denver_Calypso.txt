To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,  
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm  
To work in the service of life and living,  
In search of the answers of questions unknown  
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,  
Part of beginning to understand,  
  
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,  
The things that you've shown us,  
The stories you tell  
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,  
The men who have served you so long and so well  
  
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh  
Oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee  
Doo-dle ay ee  
  
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you  
To light up the darkness and show us the way  
For though we are strangers in your silent world  
To live on the land we must learn from the sea  
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell  
Joyful and loving in letting it be  
  
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,  
The things that you've shown us,  
The stories you tell  
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,  
The men who have served you so long and so well  
  
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh  
Oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee  
Doo-dle ay ee  
  
He dee Ay-ee  
Hi dee oh ooo  
Hi dee ayee  
Hi dee oh ooo
