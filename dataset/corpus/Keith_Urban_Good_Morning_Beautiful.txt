Good morning beautiful, how was your night?  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
It's a good morning beautiful day  
  
I couldn't see the light, I didn't know  
Day from night, I had no reason to care  
But since you came along I can face the dawn  
Cause I know you'll be there  
  
Good morning beautiful, how was your night?  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
It's a good morning beautiful day  
  
I'll never worry if it's raining outside  
'Cause in here with you girl, the sun always shines  
  
Good morning beautiful, how was your night?  
Mine was wonderful with you by my side  
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face  
It's a good morning beautiful day, yeah  
  
A good morning beautiful day  
  
Good morning beautiful, a beautiful day  
Good morning beautiful, good morning beautiful  
A beautiful day, good morning beautiful day  
A beautiful day, good morning beautiful
