Every day  
Girl I wake up and pray  
That you'll come back home  
Don't take too long  
Cause since you've been gone  
Everything's gone all went wrong  
I wish you were here  
holding me near  
  
You know I'd go  
out of my mind  
If you ever left  
my heart behind  
So I'm begging you please  
Bring your sweet love back to me  
  
If I don't have you  
(Don't have you)  
to hold on to  
(to hold on to)  
I can't go on  
in this world alone  
Baby, It's true  
(Baby, It's true)  
If I don't have you  
If you say goodbye  
(you said goodbye)  
Girl, I would die  
(Girl, I would die)  
I'm a star with no light  
a day with no night  
If I don't have you
