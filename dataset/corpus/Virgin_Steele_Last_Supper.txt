Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing  
  
Break this bread and drink the wine  
just remember with whom you dine  
do this in memory of me, when I'm not among you all  
Peter you will deny me, Judas you will betray  
last supper, it's your last supper  
  
Open wide the Gates to receive me  
high above the clouds there is peace  
after 3 days I will rise again to teach you all  
Mary you'll see me first, you others will fall amazed  
last supper, it's your last supper  
  
When the sun no longer turns thr skies are black  
darkness like a breathing hand upon your back  
they wlll kill the shepherd to divide the sheep  
but remember this forever I reign, forever I reign  
  
So damn the dark the light  
the tears you cry tonight  
damn your love your lies  
promises you broke woe  
this is your last mistake, it's written in the sand  
the law reveals itself, shining like the sun  
forever I reign, forever I reign  
  
Supper!!!  
break this bread and drink the wine  
just remember with whom you dine  
will you remember me when I'm not among you now  
Peter you still deny me, Judas you will betray  
last supper, it's your last supper  
it is finished.
