(Gene Autry)  
  
Santa works all day in his workshop  
Making lots of games and toys  
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh  
To bring them to the girls and boys  
Santa's just as nice as he can be  
There's just one little thing that worries me  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow  
On Christmas this year  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow  
On Christmas this year
