Hard to remember if anything was real  
Cold like December and I don't like how that feels  
I been livin' a long time  
I been givin' a long time too  
  
And I can't believe I wasted so much time on you  
But time has brought me back around  
Back around to me  
And I feel so free  
Yeah  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Bad like Brutus  
Hit like Joe Louis  
I gots lots of cash  
But I'm not Jewish  
  
I'm not no nudist  
I'm fully clothed  
And I fuck hot pussy until it's cold  
Got rhymes of gold Got a voice of platinum  
  
I'm not Dwayne Wayne  
But that's what's happening  
I'm back in black and if ya have to ask  
You can kiss my Anglo-Saxon ass  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Hot like a toti  
Smooth like Mondovi  
Around the way they call me Bathroom Bobby  
Sugar is my hobby and my greatest joy  
And that's why they call me "cowboy"  
  
No Jive I come alive like Frampton  
I'm bigger than Seinfeld's house in the Hamptons  
Cramp my style, go ahead and give it your best  
But I ain't met a mutha fucka who can do that yet  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Hey  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Whoo woo  
Whoo woo  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Whoo woo  
Whoo woo  
  
They call me Shotgun Bobby, rock the young hotties  
Jock the John Gottis, sock the paparazzi  
Real life Fonzie, I roll like Yahtzee  
I like stars and bars but I ain't no Nazi  
So fuck you, fuck u in the nose  
Fuck you and your flows, fuck you and your hoes  
Fuck u and your mother if u can't understand it  
I'm the illest mutha fucker on the God damn planet  
Huh
