The strange logic in your clumsiest line  
(It stayed, it stayed) it stayed emblazoned on my mind  
You say, break up the family  
And let's begin to live our lives  
  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
It wasn't youth, it wasn't life  
Born old, sadly wise  
Resigned (well, we were)  
To ending our lives  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those awful times  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
  
Yes, you found love, but you weren't  
At peace with your life  
Home late, full of hate  
Despise the ties that bind  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those younger years  
I'm in love for the first time  
And I don't feel bad  
  
Let me see all my old friends  
Let me put my arms around them  
Cause I really do love them  
Now does that sound mad?  
Captain of games, solid framed  
I stood on the touchline  
Hailstones, driven home  
In a car - no brakes? I don't mind  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those darker years  
Oh, I'm in love for the first time  
And I don't feel bad  
So wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
So wish me luck again  
Goodbye  
Wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
Mmm... wish me luck, my friends  
Goodbye  
Ahh...  
Ahh...
