I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again  
But that's not unusual  
It's just that the moon is full  
And you decided to call  
  
And here I sit, hand on the telephone  
Hearing the voice I'd known  
A couple of light years ago  
Headed straight for a fall  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair  
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square  
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air  
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there  
  
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic  
Then give me another word for it  
You were so good with words  
And at keeping things vague  
  
Cause I need some of that vagueness now  
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly  
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
