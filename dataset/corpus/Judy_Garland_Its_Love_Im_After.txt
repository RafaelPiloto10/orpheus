It's love I'm after  
North, South, East and West  
I have gone in my quest,  
Far, wide  
  
High and low  
This one thing I know  
It's love I'm after  
I don't want to be a millionaire,  
The only thing on earth  
For which I care is love  
  
Ba da da da da do  
For love and laughter,  
For love and laughter  
I give all that I posses  
Don't you know the only  
  
Name for happiness  
Is love, love, love  
Rich man, poor man,  
Beggar man, thief,  
Feel the way I do  
Because each one of them believes  
He'll find somebody like you  
  
It's love I'm after,  
Love, I'm after,  
Love, it's love I'm after,  
It may make me rise or make me fall,  
But it's love I'm after,  
After all.
