We in a dodging to a feeling I don't wanna know  
Yeah I've been running but it caught me somehow  
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway  
You made my heart beat keep pumping  
Why it ain't turn it up so loud  
  
'Cause if I don't fear the water  
And the night don't fear the thief  
It's just you and me together  
Here we are, we are, we are, we are  
  
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria  
  
Here we are, we are, we are, we are  
And you're going from inside  
Like the dot is in your eyes  
And I see it for the first time  
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria  
  
I really know the way and thought I could get in and out  
She said relax, you gonna be here for a while  
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway  
And the truth is I'm learning to loving  
And I ain't gonna turn it down  
  
If I don't fear the water  
And the night don't fear the thief  
Once the music sets you over  
Here we are, we are, we are, we are  
  
Here we are, we are, we are  
And you're going from inside  
Like the dot is in your eyes  
And I see it for the first time  
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria  
  
Here we are, we are, we are  
We are, we are  
  
Here we are, we are  
We found euphoria  
  
And you're going from inside  
Like the dot is in your eyes  
And I see it for the first time  
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
