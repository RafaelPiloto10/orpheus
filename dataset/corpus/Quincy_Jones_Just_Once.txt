I did my best  
But I guess my best wasn't good enough  
'Cause here we are back where we were before  
Seems nothing ever changes  
  
We're back to being strangers  
Wondering if we oughta stay  
Or head on out the door  
  
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong  
Why we never last for very long  
What are we doing wrong  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
If we could just get to it  
I know we could break through it  
  
I gave my all  
But I think my all may have been too much  
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere  
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going  
  
And seems at times with all we've got  
We haven't got a prayer  
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong  
Why the good times never last for very long  
  
Seems we're always blowing  
Whatever we got going  
  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
If we could just get to it  
I know we could break through it  
  
Just once I want to understand  
Why it always come back to good-bye  
Why can't we get ourselves in hand  
And admit to one another  
  
That we're no good with out the other  
Take the best and make it better  
Find a way to stay together  
  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
I know we can break through it  
If we could just get to it  
  
Just once  
If we could get to it  
  
Just Once...
