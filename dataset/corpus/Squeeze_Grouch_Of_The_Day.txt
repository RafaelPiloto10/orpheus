I feel my chin hit my chest  
As I do my best to stay calm  
I feel my face start to ache  
As I try to shake the alarm  
As I roll on my side  
There's a smile on her face  
That says much more than words ever will  
About how she maintains all the spirit she's gained  
When I'm grouch of the day  
When I've drifted away  
And I'm moping around in a sulk  
She'll have something to say  
And I usually obey  
Then I get my resentments in bulk  
That's the price that you pay  
For being grouch of the day  
  
As my legs start to shake  
The feeling is great and I'm gone  
I feel butterflies wing  
As she starts to sling music on  
As she rolls on her back  
With her smile full of charm  
That says much more than words ever will  
About how the delight of her good time tonight  
Makes me look like I'm over the hill  
Her beauty erodes  
The desperate loads  
Of pressure that fills up my day  
With one smile all the stress melts away
