How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye  
  
Everybody wants to laugh  
When you feel bad  
Seems like the only way when the nights won't pass  
When you're so sad  
If you can't go back  
And you can't look down  
  
How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye  
  
Everything comes to mind  
It's a breakdown  
The way things seem to slide  
It's a free fall  
When you're so sad  
If you can't go back  
And you can't look down  
  
How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
Walk away, tell those lies  
Why did you waste your time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye
