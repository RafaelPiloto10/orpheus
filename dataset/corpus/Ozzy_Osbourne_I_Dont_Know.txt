People look to me and say  
Is the end near, when is the final day  
What's the future of mankind  
How do I know, I got left behind  
  
Everyone goes through changes  
Looking to find the truth  
Don't look to me for answers  
Don't ask me, I don't know  
  
How am I supposed to know  
Hidden meanings that will never show  
Fools and prophets from the past  
Life's a stage and we're all in the cast  
  
Ya gotta believe in someone asking me who is right  
Asking me who to follow, don't ask me, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
  
Nobody ever told me I found out for myself  
Ya gotta believe in foolish miracles  
It's not how you play the game  
It's if you win or lose you can choose  
Don't confuse win or lose, it's up to you  
It's up to you, it's up to you, it's up to you  
  
People look to me and say  
Is the end near, when is the final day  
What's the future of mankind  
How do I know, I got left behind  
  
Everyone goes through changes  
Looking to find the truth  
Don't look to me for answers  
Don't ask me, I don't know
