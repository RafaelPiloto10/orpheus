Get your money, whip ya hair  
Executive branch blow my smoke like a player  
Yeah in the club, yes it cracks  
Cute little mama, but they stack with backs  
I'm smokin' great purple urple  
You and Doggie world come and join my circle

My money is green and my Porsche is turbo  
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop  
Maybe is the lawyer, her body's the truth

I'm all about the money, the money I got  
On the VIP tip, Maseratis in the lot  
Chillin' with stars where the bottle never stops  
Got a model on my lap, Baby show me what you got  
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy  
Girls who like girls, wanna do it today  
Real tough, this suites is next  
One more drink gon' lead to sex

Whatcha trying to drink, clearer yet?

Big 808 now filled the basin in ya chakra  
And watch me smoke like a shotta

Drunk offa love like a colt 45

Just bust a bad one for my homie d-dimes, boom

You ever taste purple rain  
Turn up the volume, adjust the game  
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G thang  
Lil' mama whip ya hair  
Exhale the chronic as the smoke disappears

Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall  
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg
