Devious to those unknown  
He walks below the land  
Alluring victims to their death  
Perish to the sand  
  
Master of the blackened arts  
Living his decree  
Thrives amongst the Seven Gates  
Searching for the keys  
  
[Chorus]  
I have seen the darkened depths of Hell  
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell  
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity  
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly  
  
Chants of evil incantation  
Fill the murky night  
Free the Devil's knights of Hell  
Unleash their growing spite  
  
Directing power forcibly  
The fire of Hell is cast  
Resurrect from crypts of Death  
A demon from the past  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cringe with fear  
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell  
Death will come searching for  
Your mere soul  
Still you are eager to seek your fate  
All that lie here are remains of Death  
  
Grinding bones, screaming skulls  
Broken by the lapse of time  
Decay to powder, ashes to dust  
Diminishing, disintegrating  
Man's soul and mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Empty space tracks throughout  
I make my claim  
  
Darkness covers the world  
My Kingdom, my Domain
