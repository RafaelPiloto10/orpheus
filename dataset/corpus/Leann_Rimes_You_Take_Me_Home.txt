I was blinded by the city lights  
LA livin' up the crazy life  
Lookin' back on how far I'd come  
Not quite sure what I was runnin' from  
  
A million miles away from the world I knew  
Who'd ever thought it'd lead me back to you  
  
[Chorus]  
You take me to front porch swings  
Mama singin "Cheatin' Heart"  
Yeah what a rush  
Catchin' lightnin' bugs in a mason jar  
  
You take me to county fairs  
Bedtime prayers  
Old wooden rockin' chairs  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
  
Took awhile to finally come around  
And separate all that was lost and found  
If there's one thing by now I better know  
The grass ain't greener where it doesn't grow  
  
I needed someone who would love me like you do  
To lead me back to the simple truth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Summer heat  
Life's so sweet  
And dancin' on daddy's feet  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
You take me home
