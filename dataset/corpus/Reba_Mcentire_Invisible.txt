They met at a party  
He was laughing with his friends  
But she captured all of his attention  
Just by walking in  
Confident and self-assured, he liked her attitude  
And the moment their eyes met  
Every girl in the room  
Became  
  
Invisible  
Just out of view  
Invisible  
Like a pane of glass  
He could see right through  
Invisible  
  
They married in October  
She made a beautiful bride  
His whole world revolved around her  
They had a picture perfect life  
But when the baby came in August  
Time started spinning like a wheel  
She expected to feel tired  
But she never thought she'd feel  
  
Invisible  
Just out of view  
Invisible  
Like a pane of glass  
He could see right through  
Invisible  
  
?Cause lately he's been overlooking  
Quite a lot  
So tonight he'll take her in his arms  
And prove to her she's not  
  
Invisible  
A love deep inside  
Invisible  
So much more than meets the eye, invisible
