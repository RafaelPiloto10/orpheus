Well I'm flying out of Tulsa  
Trying to get out to the coast  
Missing my connections  
But it's you I miss the most  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Well I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
  
Well my heart feels like bursting  
When you walk into the room  
My lips just start thirsting  
For another kiss from you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over (echo)  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to my shoes  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And that's straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see that's all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Oh I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
I'm in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And that's straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see that's all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Oh I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
I'm in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
Oh yes they do  
Cause I'm in love all over  
I'm in love all over  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Yes I'm in love all over
