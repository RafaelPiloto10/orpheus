Sail on my brother  
Sail on through the night  
Sail on my sister  
Sail on through the night  
  
Beautiful as the day is long  
Beautiful as the day is long  
  
Sail on your troubles  
Sail on through your doubts  
Sail on your worries  
Sail on soon you'll work it out  
  
Beautiful as the day is long  
Beautiful as the day is long  
  
I've always been a believer  
In the good things of life  
But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane  
And they don't always seem to turn out right  
They don't always seen to turn out right  
  
I've always been a believer  
In the good things of life  
But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane  
And they don't always seem to turn out right  
No, no, no,  
They don't always seen to turn out right  
Sometimes they do not  
Humm.... sail on
