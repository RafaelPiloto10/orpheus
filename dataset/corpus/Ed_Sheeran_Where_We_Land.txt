Treat me beneath this clear night sky  
And I will lie with you  
I start to feel those butterflies  
When I'm next to you  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
It's been this way since we were young  
We'll fight and then make up  
I'll breathe your air into my lungs  
When I feel your touch  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land
