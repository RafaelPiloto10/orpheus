She's been good to me  
And her aim is plain,  
With an open mind  
And a tender way.  
As she looks through boxes of secondhand clothes  
She's a first class person as her best friend knows.  
She's been good to me  
Helped me not to lie,  
Listens to my words  
And the truth she finds.  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
I learnt how to pray  
Every night,  
To relieve the pain  
Deep inside.  
  
I was serious with a furrowed brow  
I just fell in love what do I do now?  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
  
It didn't work for us the lesson I learnt  
The fire was lit and I got burnt.  
And I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.
