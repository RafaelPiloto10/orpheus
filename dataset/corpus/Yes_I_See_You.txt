I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you  
I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you  
I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you  
  
Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair  
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there  
I love you  
At your door second floor first world war  
I love you  
Who listens  
Tell your friend I'm aware that she care  
Who listens  
Green specks bright spiraling out in the sky  
Catch my eye turn my head have to look don't know why  
  
I see you  
Everywhere behind your hair over there  
I see you  
I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize,  
I see you  
Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair  
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there  
I love you  
  
I see you  
Everywhere behind your hair over there  
I see you  
I love you at your door second floor first world war  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you
