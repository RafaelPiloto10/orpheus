hello today  
open your eyes  
the snow is falling just like leaves  
aquarian warriors rebuild the ship  
mr rainbow is gone  
hello my love  
here's to your heart  
unfold the lillies in the deep  
the season's over, the shores are sealed  
now ashen roses rain on the fields  
innocent dreamers, look what you've done  
now it's time for the phoenix to fly  
hello today  
wake to the dawn  
to meet the guardians of the isles  
the valient captains will rule the seas till the comets return  
hello my love  
here's to your heart  
release that dream into the world  
join in the air race, leaving tonite  
how does it feel to follow the light  
beautiful dreamer, it's up to you  
if we glide through the glamour of love  
we believe in our dreams  
reaching out for above  
we believe in our dreams  
reaching out for love
