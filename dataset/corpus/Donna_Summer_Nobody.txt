Hey you, over there  
Come on down out of my sky  
I've been a long long time waiting  
Wonder why  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
But oh, life is like a rolling stone  
God bless the child who's got his own yeah  
A million times in a million ways  
I'd give my life just hear  
To hear somebody say  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Life can bring some tragedy sometimes  
So don't keep looking at the bad things  
Sometimes love can even blow your little mind  
Now I've seen it starting to happen  
You've gotta believe in the good things  
Believe in the good things  
You gotta believe that there's something that hold us in a sunny place  
You gotta believe that the sky won't fall  
Believe that's it's worth it all  
You gotta believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel  
And I know bad things sometimes happen for nothing  
But there's got to be reason we all found each other  
That we live and breathe and we need somebody else  
That's what I said  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Like a river running wild  
Like a river running wild  
I wanna walk down a down a country mile, oh baby  
No no nobody loves me  
No no nobody loves you  
The way I do  
No one can love you the way I do  
Nobody no no nobody baby  
Can ever love you like I do  
And I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
I love you  
Baby I love you
