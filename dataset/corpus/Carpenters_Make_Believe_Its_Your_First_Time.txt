We've tried our hand  
At love before  
We've been around the game enough  
To know the score'  
But then is then  
And now is now  
And now is all that matters anyhow  
  
[Chorus]  
Make believe it's your first time  
Leave your sadness behind  
Make believe it's your first time  
And I'll make believe it's mine  
  
The door is closed  
It's you and me  
We'll take our time with love  
The way it oughta be  
This moment's ours  
Tonight's the night  
And if we fall in love  
Well, that's alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So close your eyes  
And hold me close  
And let our hearts pretend  
That love is ours to share tonight  
And it might never end  
  
[Chorus]
