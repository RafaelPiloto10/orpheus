Are we gonna break it down or hang around or make it good in the end  
You make me smile when I don't feel like dealing  
You're suicidal and you're fresh out of feeling  
You say I love you like a slap on the wrist  
Do I deserve this  
Are we gonna build it up or blow it out our little fire of sin  
Are you gonna fuck it up or hear me out or honey will you give in  
Yeah  
You make denial into some kind of fashion  
You want my child but you don't have the passion  
You say I love you like a slap on the wrist  
Do I deserve this  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Do I deserve this  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Do I deserve  
You make me smile when I don't feel like dealing  
You're suicidal you're fresh out of feeling  
You say I love you like a kiss on the lips  
Do I deserve this  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Do I deserve this  
Yeah yeah yeah
