Well if you ever plan to motor west  
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best  
Get your kicks on Route 66  
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A.  
More than 2000 miles all the way  
  
Get your kicks on Route 66  
Well it goes from St Louis, down to Missouri  
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty  
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico  
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona  
Kingsman, Barstaw, San Bernadino  
  
Would you get hip to this kindly trip  
And go take that California trip
