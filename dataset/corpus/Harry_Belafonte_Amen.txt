See the little baby, Amen  
Wrapped in a manger Amen  
On Christmas morning,  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him in the temple, Amen  
Talking with the elders, Amen  
Who marveled at his wisdom  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him at the seaside, Amen  
Talking with the fishermen, Amen  
Walking the side pales  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
Oh, to in Jerusalem, Amen  
On the top branches, Amen  
He talked in splendor  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him in the garden, Amen  
Lord have mercy, Amen  
Blessed savior  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
Before Hiram, Amen  
They crucified him, Amen  
Amen, Amen, Amen
