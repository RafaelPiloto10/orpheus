Could we ever stop the thing we dare to live and love?  
I doubt it  
Could we ever picture to be back at home  
And stay wholehearted?  
  
We don't need to talk about it  
We will never fear or doubt it  
On and on  
We sing our songs  
Until we are gone  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
Are we ever looking back with sorrow and regret?  
I doubt it  
If there ever was a better way to live a dream  
We found it  
  
We don't need to talk about it  
We will never fear or doubt it  
On and on  
We sing our songs  
Until we are gone  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy
