I became her lover  
She became my lover  
Had her heart broke  
I was helping her recover  
I became the man she knew she could rely on  
Somebody to listen, a shoulder to cry on  
She was gettin' better  
Better she was gettin'  
The more time spent  
The more she would forget him  
But then back around to scene he started coming  
Now she's on the low, takin' phone calls from him  
  
I thought that we were building something strong  
He apologizes and now you're gone  
And I wont put up with this  
  
You wanna go, go  
Just hope you know  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)  
Lonely, lonely  
Come on, go, go  
Just hope you know (hey)  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again  
Lonely, lonely again  
  
Don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (oohw)  
Sugar don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (oohw)  
  
And I can't believe it (no)  
Really can't believe it  
Never in a million years, I couldn't see it  
I pulled her from the flames, so she don't expire  
She turn around and jumped right back in the fire  
What are you doing  
How could you do it  
Back to the flames, baby that's just stupid  
Had me feeling bad for you, so foolish (whatever)  
Now you deserve what you get (whoow)  
  
I thought that we were building something strong  
He apologizes and now you're gone  
Said that I wont put up with it  
  
You wanna go, go  
Just hope you know  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)  
Lonely, lonely  
Come on, go, go  
Just hope you know  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again  
Lonely, lonely again  
  
Don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (oohw)  
Sugar don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (ohhw)  
  
Hey girl  
I picked you up when you're down  
Didn't do it so you, could lay back on the ground  
I just don't understand  
You must like punishment  
If you get hurt again  
Just remember that you asked for it  
Hey hey hey hey heyyy  
Oohw woohww  
  
You wanna go, go  
Just hope you know  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)  
Lonely, lonely  
Come on, go, go  
Just hope you know  
Baby you're gonna be  
Lonely, lonely again  
Lonely, lonely again  
  
Don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (oohw)  
Sugar don't call me when you're lonely again  
When you're lonely again  
Lonely again (ohw)
