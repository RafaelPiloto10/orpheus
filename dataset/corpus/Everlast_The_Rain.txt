Every man's bound to fall  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
Life is short, the grind is long  
Some of my very best friends are gone  
My hustle's strong my money's all spent  
On buying bitches titties and drugs and rent  
Work a double shift grind, I can't save a dime  
My daughter needs medicine I just can't afford  
Bout to grab a .9, lose my mind  
My insurance keeps sayin that they won't pay for it  
I'll stage the heist, I'll pay the price  
Don't be shocked when I turn to crime, kid  
I'm goin big, I might split your wig  
Cause I ain't getting knocked for no nickel'n'dime shit  
All that glitters ain't all it seems  
The American dream is an American scheme  
What you're looking at, what you're trippin on  
Who you flippin on, see what I'm grippin on  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
I've been breakin my neck just to live correct  
Keep my head above water, living check to check  
I get no respect, I got no regard  
Patience is a struggle when times is hard  
Paper's in the shortage, tryin to pay the mortgage  
I can't get to work, they repossess my car  
Bout to buy a pistol and kidnap Bristol  
Tell me bitch, can you see me from your backyard?  
This New World session of the Great Depression  
I'm living off preemptive unchecked aggression  
You're cryin and you're bitchin, know it every politician:  
My family tradition is heavy ammunition  
I cock the hammer, I'ma rock the vote  
Got your forhead on lock, dead in my scope  
Look me in the eye, what you're lying for  
What you're living by, what you dyin for  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall
