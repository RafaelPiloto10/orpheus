Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be.  
Oh Monday morning,  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me.  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine, yeah.  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time.  
  
Monday, Monday,  
Can't trust the day.  
Monday, Monday,  
Don't go away.  
  
Oh, Monday, Monday,  
Don't go away.  
Oh, Monday, Monday
