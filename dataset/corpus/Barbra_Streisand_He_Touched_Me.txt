He touched me, he put his hand near mine  
And then he touched me  
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me  
A sparkle, a glow  
He knew it, it wasn't accidental  
No, he knew it  
He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it  
He knew it, I know  
He's real, and the world is alive and shining  
I feel such a wonderful drive t'wards valentining  
He touched me, I simply have to face the fact  
He touched me  
Control myself and try to act  
As if I remember my name  
But he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing is the same  
'Cause he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing, nothing, nothing is the same
