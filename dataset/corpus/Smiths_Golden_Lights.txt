Golden lights displaying your name  
Golden lights it's a terrible shame  
But oh my darling  
Why did you change?  
  
Boy in a million, idol, a big star  
I didn't tell you how great you were  
I didn't grovel and scream  
And rip your brand new jacket at the seams  
  
You made a record, they liked your singing  
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing  
Ah ... I never thought that you would let  
The glory make you forget  
  
Golden lights displaying your name  
Golden lights it's a terrible shame  
But oh my darling  
Why did you change?  
  
Top ten idol, king of your age  
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?  
Don't you remember you once knew a girl  
You loved her more than the world  
  
Is life always like this, brother?  
Good for one side but bad for another  
I must put you behind me tonight  
'Cause you belong to the lights  
  
Those golden lights displaying your name  
Golden lights it's a terrible shame  
But oh my darling  
Why did you change?  
  
Oh, oh my darling  
Why?  
Why did you change?  
  
Oh...
