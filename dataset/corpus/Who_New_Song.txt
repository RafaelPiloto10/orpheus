You need a new song  
I'll set the words up so they tear right at your soul  
Don't take me too long  
But there's a danger that I'll plagiarize something old  
  
My fingers kill me as I play my guitar  
'Cause I've been chewing down at my nails  
My hairline ain't exactly superstar  
But there's one thing that never fails  
This never fails  
  
I write the same old song with a few new lines  
And everybody wants to cheer it  
I write the same old song you heard a good few times  
Admit you really want to hear it  
  
Whenever I see you  
You always treat me like I'm some kind of perfect man  
Just 'cause I please you  
You explain, but you don't think I can understand  
  
My head is spinning as I scrawl with my pen  
'Cause I've been pouring vodka in my soul  
Nothing really ever changes my friend  
New lamps for old  
New lamps for old  
  
We sing the same old song, just like a vintage car  
You can look but you won't ever drive it  
We drink the same old wine from a brand new jar  
We get hung over, but we always survive it  
  
Turn on the radio  
Love is proclaimed  
Again and again and again  
Join in and sing  
Now, don't be ashamed  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain  
Let it rain  
  
We hum the same old lines to a different crowd  
And everybody wants to cheer it  
We run on endless time to reach a higher cloud  
But we never ever seem to get near it  
  
We sing the same old song
