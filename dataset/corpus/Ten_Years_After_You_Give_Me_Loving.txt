You give me loving that I can't return  
You give me money that you know I'll burn  
I'll give you something that you can't give back  
Then, I'm moving right on down the track  
You've given everything you've got to me  
But, still you cannot really set me free  
My life is changing and I'm on the run  
I'll see you later when I've had some fun  
  
I keep running, 'cause I know the score  
You'll never find me coming back for more  
I'll catch you later 'cause I'm gonna split  
You give a lot, I only need a bit  
You give me loving that I can't return  
You give me money that you know I'll burn  
You give me loving just for your own sake  
You only give it so that you can take  
  
You give me loving and it's plain to see  
You want to give it to me all for free  
But, I can't take it 'cause you need it back  
The art of giving is the one I lack  
You give me loving and you drive me mad  
You give me money and it makes me sad  
'Cause I meed freedom more than I need gold  
And so I'll leave before I get too old
