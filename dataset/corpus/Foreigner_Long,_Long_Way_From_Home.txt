It was a Monday,  
A day like any other day  
I left a small town  
For the Apple in decay  
It was my destiny  
It's what we needed to do  
They were telling me  
I'm telling you  
  
I was inside looking outside  
The millions of faces  
But still I'm alone  
Waiting, hours of waiting  
Paying a penance  
I was longing for home  
I'm looking out for the two of us  
I hope we'll be here  
When they're through with us  
  
I was inside looking outside  
Oh the millions of faces  
But still I'm alone  
Waiting, hours of waiting  
I could feel the tension  
I was longing for home  
I'm looking out for the two of us  
And I hope we'll be here  
When they're through with us  
I'm coming home  
  
Monday, sad, sad Monday  
She's waiting for me  
But I'm a long long way from home  
Sad, sad Monday  
She's waiting for me,  
But I'm a long long way from homw  
Sad, sad Monday  
Ah she's waiting for me,  
But I'm a long, long way from home
