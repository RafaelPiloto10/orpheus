It's cold outside  
It gets so hot in here  
And the boys and girls collide  
To the music in my ear  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know it's time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home  
  
A painted face  
And I know we haven't long  
We thought that we had the answers  
It was the questions we had wrong  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know it's time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home  
  
Sad song, sad song  
Sad song, sad song  
  
La lah la lah...La lah la lah...La lah lah...  
[Repeat 4x]  
  
Sad song, sad song  
Sad song, sad song  
  
Call out your name  
Call out in shame  
Call out your name  
Call out  
You better call out  
Call, call, call out
