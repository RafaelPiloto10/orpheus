Don't give up  
It's just the weight of the world  
When your heart's heavy  
I, I will lift it for you  
  
Don't give up  
Because you want to be heard  
If silence keeps you  
I, I will break it for you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well, I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Don't give up  
Because you are loved  
Don't give up  
It's just the hurt that you hide  
  
When you're lost inside  
I, I'll be there to find you  
Don't give up  
Because you want to burn bright  
If darkness blinds you  
I, I will shine to guide you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well, I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Don't give up  
Because you are loved  
You are loved  
  
Ah!  
Don't give up  
It's just the weight of the world  
Don't give up  
Everyone needs to be heard  
You are loved
