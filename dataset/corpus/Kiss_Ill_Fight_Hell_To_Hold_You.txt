In a world of doubt and danger, you see it everywhere  
Your friends turn into strangers, does anybody care  
But when all hope is lost, I'm gonna be there, whatever the cost  
When you feel lost  
Someone to hold you with all of their might  
Through the darkness night, I'll be there  
  
I'll fight hell to hold you, no river too deep or mountain high  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side  
I'm gonna fight hell to hold you, till time stands still and worlds collide  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side  
  
Ooh, the jealous and the lonely, they try to keep us apart  
But let 'em come between us, that's when the trouble starts  
Cause there's one thing I know, I'll be beside you wherever you go  
You can be sure  
Someone to carry you into the light, swear with all my might, I'll be there  
  
I'll fight hell to hold you, no river too deep or mountain high  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side  
I'm gonna fight hell to hold you, till time stands still and worlds collide  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side - ooh, by my side  
  
Cause there's one thing I know, I'll be beside you wherever you go  
You can be sure  
Someone to carry you into the light, swear with all my might, I'll be there  
  
I'll fight hell to hold you, no river too deep or mountain high  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side  
I'm gonna fight hell to hold you, till time stands still and worlds collide  
I'll fight hell to hold you by my side
