Step on up to the counter boy  
Buy yourself a thrill  
Shake it out with the deepest breath  
As you kneel over your first kill  
God is your protector, he keep you safe and warm  
The funeral director got the contract when you were born  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain  
  
Listen close going to say it one  
You need to get you right  
Use the gifts you were given boy  
Keep the end in sight  
Walk it narrow, walk it clean  
Then to the sky and fly  
I'm the breath that will fill your lungs  
Until the day you die  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain  
  
Start living, start dying  
Start praying, start flying  
(x2)  
Pinning the face to the floor, slamming and locking the door  
  
Start living, start dying  
Start praying, start flying  
(x2)  
Holding the face to the ground  
Turning the world upside down  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain
