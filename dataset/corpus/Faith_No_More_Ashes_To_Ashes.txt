I want them to know it's me  
It's on my head  
I'll point the finger at me  
It's on my head  
  
Give it all to you, then I'll be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
I'll see you  
  
I will let you shout no more  
It's on my head  
I'll pick you up from the floor  
It's on my head  
I'll let you even the score  
It's on my head  
  
Give it all to you, then I'll be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
I'll see you  
  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
  
Smiling with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer
