Hold me tight, if you want me to  
Hold me darling, you want me to  
I love you child, I love you babe  
  
I love your mama, your sister too  
I love your dog, I hope he love me too  
I love you child, I swear I love you baby  
  
Love your mama, your sister too  
Love your dog, I hope he love me too  
I love you babe, love you child  
  
I love you mama, your daddy too  
You showed me the world, when I was only two  
I love you babe, I love you child  
  
I love you since you were born  
I love you more and more and more
