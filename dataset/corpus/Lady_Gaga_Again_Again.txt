You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve  
Coming here when I'm still with him  
And I can't have you, it isn't fair  
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming  
And if I had one wish  
Yeah, you'd be it  
  
When you're 'round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
You've got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Again and again  
Again, again, again, again  
Never stop again and again  
Again, again, a a again, again  
Never stop, oh  
  
He never really saw me  
Or waited when we were hooking up  
Yeah he'd a never last  
Last week when I was sad  
You said that you knew  
My eyes change from kinda green  
To kind blue, hey yea  
  
When you're 'round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
You've got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey tell me if I leave him  
Baby would you be there  
'Cause maybe you could  
Be more than that, all the time  
I'm sad chillin'
