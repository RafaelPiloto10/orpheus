Baby, baby  
I wanna be with you tonight  
  
If I could be with you, I'd love you strong  
If I could be with you, I'd love you long  
I want you to know that I wouldn't go  
Until I told you honey why I love you so  
  
If I could be with you, one hour tonight  
If I was free to do the things I might, things I might  
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue  
If I could be with you, hmm babe  
If I could be with you
