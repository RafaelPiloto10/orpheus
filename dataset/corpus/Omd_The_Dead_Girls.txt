Those girls are laughing now  
They take my breath away  
And all these dreams i'ce had  
Come back to me  
  
The light is never on  
They haven't fixed it yet  
But catholic girls, they never fear  
They grew up with that  
  
Those girls are always dreaming  
They need your sympathy  
Their vision's fading now  
Changing by degree  
  
So take me away  
Life is never this strange  
Counting your blessings  
When you're out of rain  
  
Those girls are laughing now  
They take my breath away  
In all these dreams I've had  
The dead girls say  
  
Counting our blessings like an extra day  
We turn and walk away  
Counting our blessings like an extra day  
We prayed you wouldn't stay  
  
The dead girls never care  
They never were that way  
The dead girls never peak  
Not today
