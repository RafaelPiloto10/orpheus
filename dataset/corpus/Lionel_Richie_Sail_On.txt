Sail on down the line  
About half a mile or so  
Don't really want to know where you're going  
  
Maybe once or twice  
Time after time I tried  
To hold on to what we got  
But now you're going  
  
And I don't mind about the things you're gonna sail on  
I give all my money and my time  
I know it's a shame  
But I'm giving you back your name  
Yes, I'll be on my way  
I won't be back to stay  
I guess I'll move along  
I'm looking for a good time  
  
Sail on down the line  
Funny how the time can go  
Friends says they told me so but it doesn't matter  
It was plain to see  
That a small town boy like me  
Just wasn't your cup of tea  
I was wishful thinking  
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy  
And you gave me nothing in return  
You know it ain't so hard to say  
Would you please just go away  
I've thrown away the blues  
I'm tired of being used  
I want everyone to know  
I'm looking for a good time  
Good time  
  
Sail on honey  
Good times never felt so good
