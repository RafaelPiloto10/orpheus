And I think that I wish I was virgin  
And I smile and I think of you  
And my first, very first entry  
Clumsy and romantic  
My special mix in you  
Clumsy like the first step  
Clumsy like the first conker off the tree  
And romantic, like the wind that cuts your hair  
And romantic, like the glass that holds your drink  
Clumsy and romantic  
My special mix in you  
  
And I think that I wish I was young  
And I smile and I think of you  
And my first, very first true kiss  
Defensive and so coy  
Defensive like the jacket that holds your weight  
Defensive like the hat that holds you hair  
And coy like the first kiss, the kiss that first made you coy  
And coy like the tears, the tears that made you coy  
  
So gentle, so gentle it made you strong  
It made you strong, like the first kiss  
Clumsy and romantic, so gentle it made you strong  
Clumsy and romantic, the kiss that made you strong
