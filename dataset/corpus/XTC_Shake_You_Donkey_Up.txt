Here he come again  
Dress in all that skin  
Like he was still human being  
  
Look at he long ears  
And he big brown eyes  
And with them truth he is seeing  
  
Isn't it a shame you kicked that girl  
Isn't it a shame she kicked you back, jackass  
  
She really shake you donkey up  
She really make you donkey up  
She really shake you donkey up, quite a packet  
  
How she carry you  
Over thick and thin ice  
You still dug you spurs in  
Now you forced to walk  
Laden down with shame  
It's not just you back that's hurting  
  
Now children saddle him for riding  
Pick a fight with love and she will  
Tan your hide in  
  
She really shake you donkey up  
She really shake you donkey up  
  
Shake you donkey!
