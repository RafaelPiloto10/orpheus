I would do anything I could to be near you,  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
To be at your side  
My heart is aching for love,  
My body's shaking with desire  
Believe me, baby, when I say  
I will drink you dry  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
You're everything any man could claim  
I see your face in the night,  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But, it's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
I'd been looking for love for so long when I found you,  
Too many years I walked alone  
When I touch you inside I feel you burning me with fire,  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will feed the flame  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
I see your face in the night,  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But, it's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
You're everything any man could claim  
I see your face in the night,  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But, it's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
I would do anything I could to be near you,  
Check in on any night time flight, I don't mind  
My heart is aching for love,  
My body's shaking with desire  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will drink you dry  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
I see your face in the night,  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But, it's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
It's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do,  
It's a long long way from home
