Shawty Redd on the track (Aye bruh)  
What's happenin' homie (they rappin' like you makin' beats like me)  
I hear em nigga Shawty Redd on the track  
  
I trap all day trap all night Money all day  
I got money all night  
  
Why they keep sayin' yeah  
I don't even know  
I got court tomorrow  
I don't need to go  
I don't need a show  
I got shit to do  
Only God can judge me  
Who the fuck is you?  
They say who dat?  
Nigga we dat  
Today is trey day so I guess I'm tryin' to three dat  
Never have I ever served a nigga where he sleep at  
D's be at ya door nigga you ain't tryin' to see that  
See my suicide watch stay on suicide watch  
Kill yaself yeah them suicide rocks  
Had the nerve to write me a dear  
Young letter

I paid too much you niggas play too much  
Let the swag do the talking  
I don't say too much

I don't chase no broads  
I chase money and power  
Next time I reup I'm a buy me a chopper  
And I ain't talkin AK's I'm talkin' shit wit propellers  
Fly to the club make my old bitch jealous  
Thug motivation this is straight celebration  
I see Gizzle in his chopper outside Central Station  
This ain't a mixtape but the tape's mixed  
Black tape red tape all on one brick  
Get it on the flo' get get it on the flo  
Last night I swear to God half a mil on the flo  
Fell asleep on the money like a pillow on the flo  
Woke up got money had to get it off the flo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you know about twenty grand stuffed in a white sock  
Pull off in a white drop like I play for the White Sox  
Play wit them white blocks play wit them white squares  
You call it what you want who the fuck cares?  
I don't never sleep, why? too paranoid, OK  
State of paranoia all I do is call my lawyer  
Tell em I know them niggas that might have a lil' trouble  
OK you knows me if you beat it I pay you double  
Y'all niggas knows me if I want to I make it double  
Just know it's water whipped so you might have a lil' trouble  
Might move a little slower might get a few complaints  
Say he ran outta gas he might need a half a tank  
Thank God it's Friday fresh off the highway  
Seen too many's out he bout to pull in the driveway  
Where? In the driveway  
Take the work out, cut the duct tape  
Check the work out, young!
