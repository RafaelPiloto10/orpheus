[Verse 1]  
My fire through cold nights  
The brightest of all lights  
You are my home  
Wherever we go  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
You're giving me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, you are the reason  
  
[Verse 2]  
My heart can't stop singing  
You can't fight this feeling  
Unspeakable joy  
Ringing through my soul  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
You're giving me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, you are the reason  
  
[Bridge]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
Cause you give me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, when you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason
