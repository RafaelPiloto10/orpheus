'Silent Night', 'Snowy Night', 'The First Noel' alone  
The only 'Jingle Bells' 'round here are on the motel phone  
She calls me, comforts me, holding back a tear  
She's wishing on that yonder star and I'm missing Christmas here  
  
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
  
Christmas Eve used to be a peaceful dream of joy  
But as I toss and turn tonight, I hear a scuffled noise  
What's that, it can't be, it sounds kinda like reindeer  
But I really doubt the bearded one makes deliveries here  
  
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
  
I look out the peephole, I can't believe what I see, yeah  
It's my baby in a Santa hat and she's smilin' at me  
She brings in a two foot tree and hangs a wreath on the wall  
Looks like it's gonna be a very merry after all  
  
Holiday Inn with tinsel and mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And we're watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
Yeah, and it's a wonderful life at the Holiday Inn
