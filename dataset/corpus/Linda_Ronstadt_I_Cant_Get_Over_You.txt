I've been tryin' for a long, long time  
But no matter what I do  
When I turn to leave, my heart stays behind  
'Cause I can't get over you  
  
I keep movin' on, runnin' hard and fast  
But everywhere that I run to  
I'm just standin' still, living in the past  
'Cause I can't get over you  
  
If memories were like the leaves that fall  
The wind would have carried them from my mind  
The seasons pass, but they never change  
A broken heart can't keep time  
  
I've watched as colors faded in the sun  
The colors of my love stay true  
I've been letting go now, I'm not holdin' on  
I just can't get over you  
I just can't get over you
