Vigor, vim, vitality and punch  
The ability to act on a sudden hunch  
Nerve to tackle the hardest thing  
Feet that climb and hands that cling  
A heart that never forgets to sing  
That's pep [Repeat: x3]  
  
Sand and grit in a concrete base  
A friendly smile on an honest face  
A spirit that helps when another's down  
Knows how to scatter the blackest frown  
Love's it's neighbor, love's it's town  
That's pep [Repeat: x4]  
  
Say "I will", for you know you can  
Look for the best in every man  
Meet each thundering knockout blow  
Come back with a smile 'cause you know  
You get the best of the whole damn show  
That's pep [Repeat: x6]  
  
You know that's pep
