I couldn't fall asleep all last night my mind was racin'  
I left so much behind to find the dream that I was chasin'  
And now I have a need to take a look at what is real  
I need to learn to live and love and breathe and touch and feel  
  
But all I really know is what I see  
And everybody sees it differently  
I wish someone would open up my heart and look inside of me  
But I'm the only one who holds the key  
  
Your body aglow as if to show you peacefully dreamin'  
So only you could know that deep inside somebody was screamin'  
And callin' out to anyone who could help you through the night  
And hopin' that someone would come along to make it right  
  
But all you really know is what you see  
And everybody sees it differently  
I wish someone could open up your soul and set the demon free  
But you're the only one who holds the key
