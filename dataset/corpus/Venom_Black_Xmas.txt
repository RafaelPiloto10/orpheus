When the snow turns black  
I'll be back - I'll be here  
Between the blinking of an eye  
Welcome back - Cavalier  
When the screams attack  
Before the newborn starts to cry  
Flaming star or the call of the wild  
And it's all in the eyes of a child  
The whispers in the breeze  
Black Xmas - Devils Eve  
Black Xmas - Devil's wine  
The river bleeds in time  
That's the place - In a dream  
Where the red clouds chase  
Across the suns hot blazing sky  
Where he hides his face  
In disgrace - For his queen  
He must choose the way she dies  
And they say when his eyes turn to green  
He'll awake living sin never seen  
That's the clue - To believe  
Watches over you  
Watch his eyes look through  
An instant and you're hypnotised  
False or true - To deceive  
You take his place you're crucified  
Black Xmas - Devils Eve  
The whispers in the breeze  
The river bleeds in time  
Black Xmas - Devil's wine  
Black XmasBlack Xmas - Devil's wine
