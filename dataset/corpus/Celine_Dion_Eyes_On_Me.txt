I know that once in love  
You don't think of the devil who's inside  
And maybe it'll come one day  
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time  
  
You hear what you wanna hear  
Play it once I could disappear  
Some rules to the game of me  
Get it right for both of us  
  
Just say what you wanna say  
I've got it to give away  
We both wanna make it last  
So keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
  
It's not an illusion  
That you're the one  
And I have fallen deep  
I said it from the start  
When we're apart  
You must only think of me  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
  
And say that you want me  
Open up your heart  
Even if it's hard  
Say that you need me  
Then let him know  
Baby don't put on a show  
  
You say that you need me  
Tell him how you feel  
Let him know it's real  
And if you love me  
Never turn your back  
Gonna keep my eyes on him  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me
