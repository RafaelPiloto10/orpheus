You're one in a million, a hundred to one shot  
I took a gamble and just lookie here what I got  
A diamond in the middle of a field full of stone  
And I'm bettin' everything I got  
Hey, that you can keep me comin' home  
  
Finders are keepers  
And I'm keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand  
  
A needle in a haystack would be easy to do  
Compared to me finding somebody else like you  
I tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the dice  
She's as pretty as a natural eleven  
And I'm puttin' my heart on the line  
  
Finders are keepers  
And I'm keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand  
  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, keep on keepin' on with your lovin' man
