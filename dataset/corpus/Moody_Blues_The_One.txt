No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise  
You wanna be the one  
Heard you had a story to tell  
Sold your soul in a kiss and tell  
Sliding down on a helter-skelter ride  
Into yesterday  
No way out, the price of fame  
Once it's told will you be the same  
Rolling down on a roller coaster ride  
We'll be waiting for you  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one  
No surprise  
You wanna be the one  
Shock the world with your fall from grace  
Glory days gone without a trace  
No surprise you're a face without a name  
But we all still love you  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one  
No surprise  
You wanna be the one  
It's time to tell you  
We're faithful and true  
Take us back to the days  
When we could dream  
'cause it makes us happy  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one  
No surprise  
No surprise  
Hey that you wanna be the one again  
No surprise
