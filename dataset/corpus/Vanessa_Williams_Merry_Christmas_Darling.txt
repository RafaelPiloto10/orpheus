Greeting cards have all been sent  
The christmas rush is through  
But I still have one wish to make  
A special one for you  
  
Merry christmas darling  
We're apart that's true  
But I can dream and in my dreams  
I'm christmas-ing with you  
Holidays are joyful  
There's always something new  
But every day's a holiday  
When I'm near to you  
The lights on my tree  
I wish you could see  
I wish it every day  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you merry christmas  
Happy new year, too  
I've just one wish  
On this christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
That I wish you merry christmas  
Happy new year, too  
I've just one wish  
On this christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you  
  
(merry, merry, merry christmas  
Merry christmas  
Darling)
