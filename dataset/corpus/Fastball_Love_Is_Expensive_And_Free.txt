You can talk to me about powder-kegs  
And how I'm sittin' on one right now.  
You can warn me about candles  
With both ends burning  
From the outside, in.  
  
But, don't tell me about true love.  
Because I don't think you really know.  
  
You need to pay the cost.  
You need to feel the loss.  
'Cause love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
  
Talk to me about appearances  
I'll tell you, lately, they mean less and less.  
Do your best to keep me occupied,  
It's hard to concentrate  
I must confess.  
  
Don't you tell me about heartbreak,  
'cause it ain't written in the stars.  
  
You need to pay the cost.  
You need to feel the loss.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
  
Alright,  
You got me  
  
Don't you worry 'bout my baby,  
Her eyes are open all the time.  
I could never dare deceive her,  
Much less remove her from my mind.  
I didn't talk to you about true love.  
I didn't think you'd understand.  
  
We need to pay the cost.  
We need to feel the loss.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.
