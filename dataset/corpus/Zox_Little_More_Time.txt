Give me just a little more time,  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
I don't want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
Ghosts white in the moonlight  
and the car breathes smoke in the middle of the night.  
All tangled up in the telephone lines and dry eyes.  
  
When you hold me close,  
Pretend like you don't want to let me go.  
And take the long way home,  
Soft as the radio.  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
I don't want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
My god how scarred we are,  
To feel so little in somebody's arms.  
Smokestacks burnin' up the boulevard  
And we break apart,  
It's the easy part.  
  
Kiss me once good night.  
Your skin is glass in the dashboard lights.  
And we make up our minds,  
Two for the last time.  
  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
  
But if you give me more time  
(Give me more time)  
If you could give me more time  
(Give me more time)  
  
'Cause I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)  
  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)
