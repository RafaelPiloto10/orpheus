Put my hand on the Bible  
Do me for liable  
It's suing season,  
And I am broke  
  
Buy me some happy  
Find me some passion  
Will it ever happen?  
Heaven knows  
  
Sometimes you've got to get the joke  
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
Who put this spanner in my spokes?  
I can't change how it's wrote  
  
Classy or flashy  
At home with Lassie  
They all walk past me,  
I wouldn't know.  
  
Make me a new man  
Find me a new plan  
I am a sports fan,  
A real bloke.  
  
Sometimes you've got to get the joke  
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat  
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes?  
I can't change how it's wrote.  
  
And when my ship comes in, she'll be on it,  
Eating a fresh kebab and I want it.  
And I want it now.  
  
Sometimes you've got to get the joke,  
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat.  
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes?  
I can't change how it's wrote.  
  
Sometimes you've got to get the joke,  
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat.  
You get the dagger out of the cloak.  
I can't change how it's wrote.
