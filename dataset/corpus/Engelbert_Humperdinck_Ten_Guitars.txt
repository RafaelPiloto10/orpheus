I have a band of men and all they do is play for me  
They come from miles around to hear them play a melody  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what you do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Guitars are made for love my band of men will always say  
So give each one a pretty girl and they will start to play  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what to do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Ooh, let me tell you now  
Dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
Hmm, come on, everybody,  
Dance dance dance to my ten guitars
