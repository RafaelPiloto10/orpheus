There will be a time in your life  
When you'll need me the most  
But I won't be there  
There will be a time in your life  
When you won't need me at all  
I won't be there  
But while I've got the chance  
I'm gonna tell you what I know  
About this world we're living in  
It may seem so beautiful  
From where you are  
It may look so innocent  
In your eyes  
But let me tell you  
It's not a bed of roses  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
I can sit here and teach you  
Every trick in the book  
But at the end of the day  
It is your life  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
You don't have to worry  
The future is in your hands
