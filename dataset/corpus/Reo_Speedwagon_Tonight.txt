It's all on my shoulders  
And it was gettin' harder to bear  
Each day I was gettin' older  
And I was startin' to show the wear  
Tonight I'm gonna get it all  
Gonna lay my work on the shelf?  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you It was a hard run this time momma  
And it ain't ever gonna get easier  
I'm searchin' through my memories  
And I can't remember of a year?  
But tonight I'm gonna get it all  
Gonna lay my work on the shelf  
  
[Repeat x6]  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you
