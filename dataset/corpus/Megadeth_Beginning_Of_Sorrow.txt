Beginning of sorrow  
There'll be no tomorrow  
Beginning of sorrow  
  
Easy prey, so innocent  
She barely was a teen  
Hooked up with mr. right now  
A nightmare that stole her dreams  
Complications come  
The doctor says you gotta know  
You decide if the baby lives  
But one of you has got to go  
  
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow  
There will be no tomorrow, there'll be no tomorrow  
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow  
There will be no tomorrow  
  
Brought forth in agony  
This life was misbegot  
Born in an alleyway  
A child nobody will adopt  
Delinquent in a foster home  
His heart is so full of rage  
His first name's "ward"  
His last name is "of the state"  
  
Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies  
  
Like father, like son  
Soon he gets revenge  
Two souls soon become one  
The vicious cycle never ends  
Unwanted, unloved  
He lives now just to hate  
From the pain of being born  
And nothing can take that away  
  
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow  
There will be no tomorrow, there'll be no tomorrow  
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow  
There will be no tomorrow
