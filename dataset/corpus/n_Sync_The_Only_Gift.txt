I was makin' my list  
I was checkin' it twice  
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes  
For in my foolish heart, there was one simple truth  
The only gift I wanted was you  
I was trimming the tree  
I was stringing the lights  
While the radio played "Silent Night"  
There were presents you sent  
Though there were quite a few  
The only gift I wanted was you  
  
[Chorus:]  
You need to be home with me  
Alone with me  
Holding me next to the Christmas tree  
Kissing under the mistletoe  
As candles glow  
Please come home soon  
It's not the same without you  
  
As the bitter-sweet night had come to an end  
I was saying goodbye to our family and friends  
And they all wished me well  
And I knew that I knew  
The only gift I wanted was you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa la la la la la la  
Ohhh, ohhh  
The only gift I wanted was you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was makin' my list  
I was checkin' it twice  
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes  
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth  
The only gift I wanted was you  
For in my wishful heart, there was one simple truth  
The only gift I wanted was you
