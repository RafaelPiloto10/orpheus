I was so lost and you were so profound  
You taught me how to fly with my feet still on the ground  
And you told me to be what it is that I was  
No matter what all of the businessmen said  
  
Serious Richard, why do you frown like you do?  
Why do you think the whole world is after you?  
Well, you're probably right and it's probably true about me, too  
  
'Cause sometimes the world ain't sweet  
Oh these days, when was it ever?  
Maybe it's just this city hurts  
Oh Richard, I love you worse  
  
Serious Richard  
I often recall the time in the doorway in Paris  
The time of the broken sinks and the broken hearts  
And the broken weeds that we tore apart  
Thinking they were flowers, thinking they were art  
  
We were so smart, Richard  
We liked our love, we loved to live  
Out in the streets we knew how to give  
We were alive, happy to be alive  
  
You don't know my memory lingers  
Or the message of your fingers  
  
Serious Richard, where did you go?  
I never thought an ending we would ever know  
Now it's so cold without your love
