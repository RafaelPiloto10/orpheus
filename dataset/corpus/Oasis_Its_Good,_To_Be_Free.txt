Head like a rock spinning round and round  
I found it in a hole sitting upside down  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky  
You demand the answers but don't know why  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
  
So what would you say if I said to you  
It's not in what you say it's in what you do  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Bring it on home to where we found  
Head is like a rock sitting upside down  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
Yeah it's good yes it's good it's good to be free
