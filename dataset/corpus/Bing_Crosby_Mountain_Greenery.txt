On the first of May, it is moving day,  
Spring is here, so blow your job,  
Throw your job away!  
Now's the time to trust,  
To your wanderlust,  
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait  
Just you wait!  
  
In a mountain greenery,  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together.  
While you love your lover,  
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,  
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.  
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,  
So you can cook... while I stand looking  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery home!  
  
Simple cooking means  
More than French Cuisines  
I've a banquet planned which is  
Sandwiches and beans  
Coffee's just as grand  
With a little sand  
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy  
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! 'Atta boy.  
  
In a mountain greenery,  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together.  
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering  
Where no pests are pestering  
No dear momma holds us in tether  
Mosquitoes here,  
Won't bite you dear,  
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery,  
Far from life's machinery  
Bless our mountain greenery home!
