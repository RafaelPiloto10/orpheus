Whoah!  
  
Grab a drink  
Come with me, yeah we're stepping out  
Gonna rage, gonna riot 'til we're passing out  
Have the time of our lives, never take it slow  
So tonight gonna live, gonna let it go  
To the young and the reckless come and catch the disease  
Gonna stay up all night'n do whatever we please  
Because you only die once so today we seize  
So don't wait up, wait up, give it up to me  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Night is young, having fun  
Someone spiked the punch  
Gonna rage, gonna riot 'til we lose our lunch  
Up all night, sleep all day, gonna do it right  
So tonight going hard, going hard tonight  
Break out the hard days nights and escape the dream  
Another good man down another played out theme  
We're gonna stay out all night, there's a dawn to see  
So don't wait up, wait up, give it up to me  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Line 'em up, tip 'em back  
Let the fun begin  
Save your red Solo cup, fill it up again  
So what's up?  
All dressed up and nowhere to go  
Take a chance, come with me, all you never know  
It's you against the world, like a movie scene  
So throw another one back like a party fiend  
You know all we got is now, nowhere else to be  
Get up, stand up and come with me!  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
  
'Til the sun comes up!  
  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!
