Check it out, y'all  
(There've been times in my life)  
I'm tired and I wanna give up  
(I've been wondering why)  
Why is the world gettin' so crazy?  
(Still, somehow I believe)  
I've come too far to die now  
(I always survive)  
If you're a survivor, get up!  
Let's get it!  
  
Gonna cry now, go ahead and get it out of my system  
I know I hurt now, but soon I gotta get back to livin'  
Can't be here next year, givin' you these same tears  
I hope you enjoyed it, cause it's the last time you will take a piece of me  
  
I start right now, I don't know how I'm gonna get through it  
I know right now, I pray somehow cause I can't do it  
I can't keep livin' like this, there's gotta be more than this  
Jesus, I'm ready, I'm ready for what you have for me  
  
(Are you gonna wait for a sign?)  
Are you ready for your miracle  
God's people it's time to (stand up and fight)  
Let's get it, let's get it, this is it!  
Can't mess with my mind anymore, this is it!

It's a new day, I'm not afraid anymore, this is it!  
Yes, I believe, if you believe, help me say this is it!  
  
I'm a child of the king baby, look at somebody and tell 'em, this is it!  
  
I look back now, I look at how you tried to break me  
To take my life, my peace of mind and drive me crazy  
My self esteem, my dreams, my destiny  
So, God allowed it, because He knew He had big plans for me (Hallelujah!)  
  
It's your grace, I know today it's how I made it (Thank You, Jesus)  
When I thought that it was over' (Lord, have mercy)

Are you ready for your miracle
