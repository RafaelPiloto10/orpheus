Tha world is mine nigga get back  
Don't fuck with my stack the gage is racked  
About to drop the bomb I'm tha motherfuckin' don  
Big fish in a small pond  
Now tha feds tryin' to throw the book at the crook  
But I shook they worm and they hook  
Guppies hold they breath  
They wanna miss me when I'm tipsey  
Runnin' everything west of the Mississippi  
It's the unseen pullin' strings wit my pinky ring  
We got your woman so pucker up, fo we fuck her up  
Bow down before I make a phone call  
Got 25 niggas runnin' up on ya'll  
For the cheese, we want them keys, everybody freeze  
On ya knees butt naked please  
Before any of you guppies get heart  
Nigga rewind my part and  
Bow down, when I come to my town  
Bow down, when I'm west-ward bound  
Bow down, 'cause I ain't no hater like you  
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you  
I take ten steps and I draw  
Now who's dissin' the mad ass Inglewood addition  
I bust like a pimple my mind is illmental  
The Westside connects with me and south central  
And a drag from tha zig zag can't fuck with the Philly's  
Holdin' down tha wild west like a kid they call Billy  
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda  
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a crome pistola  
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss  
My look bring you fear with gear deom the Surplus  
Since a teen I chased tha green the crack scene king  
Lolos Cornishes and Bagguetts on my peices  
So reconize these real G's take the cheese  
The westdside connect keep it rollin' like gold D's  
Three wheelin' and dealin' is like tha California style  
But in tha mean while in my town you got to bow  
Bow down, when you come to my town  
Bow down, when I'm west-ward bound  
Bow down, because I ain't a hater like you  
Bow down to to a nigga that's greater than you  
Well, it's that chuck wearin' still sportin' a beanie  
The shadiest nigga in the click who want to see me  
As I slide my locs on let my khakis hang  
Westside connect gang, connect gang bing bing bang  
Run away, run away don't get your punk ass laid  
By this H double O to D to the S.T.A  
Fuck hidin' it I'm gang conected simple and plain  
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game  
Flashy niggas get stuck up beat the fuck up  
When you come around keep your chain tucked  
From this zero, zero's apostrophe is shit  
Shake a studio lyricist I'm real with this  
Talk the talk, walk the walk  
Dis me on wax and I'm trying to saw your whole fuckin' head off, nya  
I'm platium bond so bitch shut up  
And nigga all ya'll could kiss my converse like sh'o nuff  
Bow down, when I come to your town  
Bow down, when I'm west-ward bound  
Bow down, 'cause I ain't a hater like you  
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you  
Bow down, when you come to my town  
Bow down, when we west-ward bound  
Bow down, 'cause we ain't no haters like you  
Bow down, to some niggas that's greater than you  
Tell you somethin' gangstas make the world round  
So you ain't got the clown  
But if you live on the west side of your town  
Make th'em other fools bow down  
West side connection, the world belongs to us  
Bow down, bow down, bow down  
Bow down, when you come to our town  
Bow down, where we westward bound  
Bow down, 'cause we ain't no hater like you  
Bow down, to some niggas that's greater than you, fool
