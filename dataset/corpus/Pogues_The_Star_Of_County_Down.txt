Near Banbridge Town in the County Down  
One morning last July  
A boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair  
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself  
For to see I was really there  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head  
And I looked with a feelin' rare  
And I says, says I, to a passer-by  
"Whose the maid with the nut brown hair?"  
He smiled at me and he says's, says's he  
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown  
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann  
She's the star of the County Down"  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there  
I'll dress in my Sunday clothes  
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked  
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose  
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke  
Till my plough turns rust colored brown  
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside  
Sits the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down
