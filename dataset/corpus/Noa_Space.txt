Space  
Gimme wide open space  
With the sun and the rain in my hair  
And the wind in my face, oh...  
  
Space  
Gimme wide open space  
With the sun and the rain in my hair  
Every breath that I take, oh...  
  
Space to cross, no pain, no fear  
Space to cross, far away from here  
Space to cross, no pain, no fear  
Space to cross, far away from here  
  
Space  
Gimme wide open space  
With the sun and the rain in my hair  
And the wind in my face, oh...  
  
Space to cross, no pain, no fear  
Space to cross, far away from here  
Space to cross, no pain, no fear  
Space to cross, far away from here  
  
Your face and mine  
The color of the earth  
We both will scream  
We scream when we give birth  
  
We both will cry when our parents leave us  
We both will die, someday.
