Well, it's shinin' brightly  
It's lookin' pretty right  
From the early morning  
Till real real late at night  
It's lookin'pretty good today  
The dark clouds are rollin' away  
Oh and it's shinin' brightly  
And I think it's gonna be okay  
  
Well, it's startin' to feet good again  
You and me  
Startin'to feel real good lady  
Just the way it used to be  
Futures lookin' good at last  
Rough times are all in the post  
Oh and it's shinin' brightly  
And I think it's gonna last  
I think it's gonna last  
Oh yeah  
  
Well, it's shinin' brightly  
I don't think there's too much doubt  
This time baby  
I think we got it all worked out  
Lookin' pretty good today  
The dark clouds are rollin' away  
And it's shinin' brightly  
I think we're on our way  
Its a nice change  
Feeling pretty good at last  
Rough times are all in the post  
Oh, and it's shinin' brightly  
I think it's gonna last  
Oh, it's gonna be okay
