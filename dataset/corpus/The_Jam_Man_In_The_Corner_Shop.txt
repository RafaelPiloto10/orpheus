Puts up the closed sign does the man in the corner shop  
Serves his last and he says goodbye to him  
He knows it is a hard life  
But its nice to be your own boss really  
  
Walks off home does the last customer  
He is jealous of the man in the corner shop  
He is sick of working at the factory  
Says it must be nice to be your own boss (really)  
  
Sells cigars to the boss from the factory  
He is jealous is the man in the corner shop  
He is sick of struggling so hard  
He says- it must be nice to own a factory  
  
Go to church do the people from the area  
All shapes and classes sit and pray together  
For here they are all one  
For God created all men equal
