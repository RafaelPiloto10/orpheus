beauty for ashes  
life evermore  
peace beyond measures  
jesus won it all  
  
saved out of darkness  
cleansed by his blood  
into his kingdom  
by the power of god  
  
chorus:  
  
he has won it, my salvation  
my forgiveness, at the cross  
he is healing, he's redemption  
for whoever would come  
he has won, that's the cross  
  
all can take freely  
water of life  
let all who thirst, come  
worship jesus christ  
  
chorus:  
  
he has won it, my salvation  
my forgiveness, at the cross  
he is healing, he's redemption  
for whoever would come  
he has won, that's the cross  
  
for in him is the life  
that destroyed sin and death  
and he broke every chain  
for the bound and oppressed  
  
he's alive, he's alive
