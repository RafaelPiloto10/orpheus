Shut up  
I'm not like you  
Back off  
Don't smother me  
Fuck this  
I see through you  
Suffer me through  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
Shut up I'm not like you  
  
Suffer me through  
Type a Fly away don't lie  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I won't let you get the best of me  
  
If I try, if I try  
  
Oh god  
I can't stand you  
Disappoint you  
With me  
  
One day you'll come down too  
Suffer me through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shut up  
I'm not like you  
Back off  
Don't smother me  
  
Fuck this  
I see through you  
Suffer me through  
  
Oh god  
I can't stand you  
Disappoint you  
With me  
  
One day you'll come down too  
Suffer me through  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I won't let you get the best of me  
  
If I try, if I try  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I won't let you get the best of me  
  
I tried,I tried
