[Intro - lil wayne]  
Cut the music up  
A lil' louder  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus - lil wayne]  
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love, how to love  
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever  
Now you in the corner tryna put it together  
How to love, how to love  
  
[Hook - lil wayne]  
For a second you were here, now you over there  
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love, never had love  
  
[Verse 1 - lil wayne]  
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious  
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing  
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds  
Without you being insecure  
You never credit yourself so when you got older  
It's seems like you came back 10 times over  
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner  
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder  
  
[Chorus - lil wayne]  
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love, how to love  
  
Enrique:  
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios  
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?  
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso  
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente
enamorado.  
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo
locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado.  
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber
amar como amar?  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen
suplicando como amar  
  
[Verse 3 - lil wayne]  
Ooohh, see I just want you to know  
That you deserve the best  
You're beautiful  
You're beautiful  
Yeahh  
And I want you to know  
You're far from the usual  
Far from the usual  
  
[Chorus - lil wayne]  
How to love  
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love, how to love  
  
Enrique  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?  
  
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love, how to love  
  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
