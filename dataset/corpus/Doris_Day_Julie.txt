(Julie)  
It's the voice of my one love  
And it promises ecstasy  
Day and night it is calling me  
But I'm afraid to go  
  
(Julie)  
Though I run to escape it  
Still it calls irresistibly  
And although it's my destiny  
Sorrow is there, I know  
  
Warm are his arms, tender his kiss  
But in his eyes hidden, the danger lies  
  
(Julie)  
Must I go where he leads me?  
Though it be through eternity  
Oh, I know I will never be free  
Free from the voice that calls  
(Julie)
