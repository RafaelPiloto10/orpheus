I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,  
And I bought her a home with a view.  
I took her to the end of the rainbow,  
But all I left her was blue.  
Seems I never had time to love her,  
And now it seems time just stands still.  
  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
  
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely  
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely  
  
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
  
Yeah, I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.
