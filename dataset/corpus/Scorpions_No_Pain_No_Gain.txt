Face in the gutter eyes on the floor  
Knocked down twice can't take it no more  
You got no vision in your head  
You got no vision better dead  
Get on your feet open the door  
  
Walk on down you know the score  
It's a dead-end street back to the wall  
You get it together you can get it all  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
  
No time for losers you make the call  
Believe in yourself stand tall  
Another day it's in your hand  
You can be the winner in the end  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain (yeah, yeah)  
  
Keep runnin' don't look back  
Keep movin' paint it black  
Keep goin' don't ever stop  
There's time to rest the day you'll drop  
  
You roll the dice you play the game  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain  
No pain no gain  
...
