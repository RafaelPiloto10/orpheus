It's too late, it's too late now,  
To pry away, to pry away.  
  
The candle burns on both ends,  
So where does it leave us?  
Standing emptier than we ever left you,  
With your head in the water it's getting harder to breathe,  
So stand up, stand up.  
  
It's too late to pry away.  
  
Don't get me wrong,  
I'm just as scared as you are now.  
They dropped us off here with no direction,  
But you never even tried to fight the current.  
Watch the water pouring faster into your lungs,  
So breathe in, breathe in.  
  
It's too late to pry away.  
  
But it's hard to hear me when you're sinking.  
  
Swim here, I wanna see you,  
Wash it down, wash it down.  
  
How can you sleep here? I've been  
I don't believe it, a single word you sold to me.  
  
You're burning, for the last time,  
I swear I'm done with all your fears.  
  
It's too late, to pry you away from the undertow,  
I watch it take you, then I walk away
