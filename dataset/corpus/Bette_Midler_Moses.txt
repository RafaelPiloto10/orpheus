Diamonds, roses, I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness,  
Part this red river of pain.  
I don't necessarily buy  
Any key to the future or happiness  
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes  
Or I think I'll die.  
  
And everywhere is somewhere but nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
But I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer. Heh.  
  
Every time I see him he smiles  
And tells me how well he's walking these miles.  
But he never ever asks a single thing about me.  
If I died he'd hear about it eventually.  
Diamonds, roses, I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness,  
Part this red river of pain. Ohhh.  
  
'Cause everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
And I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With my bills in the mailbox and some checks that won't clear this year.  
  
Everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
So I'm just a tragic figure in the corner over here  
Who'll sleep it off 'til morning and still not know that we're,  
  
We're all just diamonds and roses. I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.
