Now I could lie by your side  
All serrated for you  
Down below cancer grows  
Weeping waits inside you too  
All our rage begs a stage  
It's a waste of time though  
And you style seems worthwhile  
But this lonely road has turned  
  
And you faded there  
They pretend to care  
Vultures waiting  
If you don't like me  
Certify Me  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah - I don't know  
Yeah - I won't go  
Yeah - save it I'm okay  
  
And in the sun a loaded gun  
Makes for conversation  
All the while in denial  
It's too late for me to change  
  
And you were unchained  
Nothing more had changed  
I could fake it  
If you still hate me  
Confiscate me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah - I won't play yeah  
Yeah - Go away yeah  
Yeah - Save it I'm okay  
  
And you were unchained  
Nothing more had changed  
I could fake it  
If you still hate me  
Confiscate me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah - I won't play yeah  
Yeah - Go away yeah  
Yeah - Save it I'm okay
