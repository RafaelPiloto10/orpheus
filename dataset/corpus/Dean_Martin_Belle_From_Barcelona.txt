(Eyes exciting very amoroso  
Lips inviting real delicioso)  
We sailed in to the port of Barcelona  
And I could see her standing there  
As I strolled by her verandah  
She tossed me a rose from her hair  
The steamer was anchored for an hour  
And she seemed like a dream come true  
I stopped and picked up the flower  
Not knowing it meant I love you  
O-O-Le that belle from Barcelona way  
If you could see her o-o-le  
You'd know I only needed to say o-le  
Hey muchacha  
She showed a lot of muchacha  
She kissed me and ooo-cha-cha  
I knew I was there to stay  
Oh chiquita you are muchilina  
Oh chiquita you are so bonita  
Eyes exciting very amoroso  
Lips inviting very delicioso
