What ails you, my daughter dear?  
Your eyes, they look so dim,  
Have you had any sore sickness,  
Or yet been sleeping with a man?  
  
No I haven't had any sore sickness,  
But I know what's ailing me,  
I am thinking of my own true love  
Who ploughs the raging sea.  
  
Is he a Lord or a Duke or a knight  
Or a man of wealth and fame?  
Or is he one of our sailor lads  
Come tell me now his name.  
  
He is no Lord nor Duke nor knight  
Nor a man of wealth or fame.  
He is one of your sailor lads  
John Barbour is his name.  
  
Now if John Barbour is his name,  
A lowly sailor man is he,  
If John Barbour is his name,  
Then hanged he shall be.  
  
Then he called his sailors all  
By one, by two, by three  
John Barbour was the first he called  
But the last came down was he.  
  
When he came a dancing down,  
He was clothed all in white  
His cheeks were like the roses red  
And his teeth were ivory bright.  
  
He paid their wages with a smile  
And to John Barbour he did say  
If I was a woman as I am a man  
My bed fellow you would be.  
  
And will you marry my daughter Jane?  
And take her by the hand  
And will you come and dine with me  
Take charge of all my lands.  
  
Yes I will marry your daughter Jane  
And take her by the hand  
And I will come and dine with you,  
But to hell with all your land.  
  
For if you can give her one gold piece,  
Then I can give her three.  
For they call me young John Barbour  
And I plough the raging sea.
