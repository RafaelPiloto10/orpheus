Stones of thought the sleaper awakes  
Gone but a chioce which path will I take  
No longer my prison my key to the past  
I'll mention your sorrow now love will ever last  
Love will ever last  
Your voice on a thought now is your blood  
A chance for new life  
Now so close in your eye  
The same lies now renders my thought  
You belted me silly, now bathe in my snot!  
Stones of thought the sleaper awakes  
Gone but a chioce which path will I take  
No longer my prison my key to the past  
I'll mention your sorrow now love will ever last  
Love will ever last
