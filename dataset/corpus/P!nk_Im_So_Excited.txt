Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen  
Tonight we'll put all other things aside  
Give in this time and show me some affection  
We're going for those pleasures of the night  
  
I want to love you  
Feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you  
I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go  
  
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I want you, I want you  
  
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow  
Sweet memories will last a long, long time  
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry  
And if we still playing around boy that's just fine  
  
Let's get excited  
(Oh) we just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I want you, I want you  
  
Oh I'm gonna want to love you  
Feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you  
I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go  
  
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I want you, I want you  
  
I'm so excited (look what you do to me)  
And I just can't hide it (you've got me burning up)  
(Oh) I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited (look what you do to me)  
And I just can't hide it (I've got to give it up)  
(Oh) I know, I know, I want you (repeat verse till fade)
