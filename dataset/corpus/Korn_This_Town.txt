We all know the chosen toys, candy girls, and pretty boys  
Make up that face to win the race  
Life's a bitch in this town  
Suck my dick in this town  
  
This town is our town  
It is so glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
Change our mind like we said before  
We are dreamers, we are whores.  
Discarded scars like worn out cars.  
Litter the streets of this town  
Litter the streets in this town  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So mother fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'd live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
Break it down boys  
  
Human waste in the house  
Human waste in the house  
Human waste in the house  
  
Here we fucking go!  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So mother fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town  
This town  
This town  
This town
