An Angel's kiss now fallen  
Descending scarlet cuts the sky  
Faded names left on the wall  
Honor the fighting leave life to  
Die  
  
Remembered is the sacrifice but  
No appraisal of blood still flowing  
Who were the leaders?  
What controlled the Killing Hand  
That caused this mouthing?  
  
Crossing over  
  
Lowered deep into the sea  
Being a waits to cleanse his soul  
Senses weakening time is still  
Motionless by stiffening cold  
  
The wheels race back and  
Scorch his mind  
Traveling all to find the land  
Revelation warms a touch  
And now he will begin to  
Understand  
  
Extended a view to yesterday  
Manifestation for none the same  
Walking amidst a frightening still  
No sound, no smoke, no scorching  
Flames  
  
He is risen  
  
Sipping his poison the raven sings  
Yet another to add more bodies  
Fallen  
King from below  
This one controls  
The Killing Hand that caused this  
Mourning  
  
Is it all over?  
  
[IV. Thorns]  
Evil genius this secret plan  
Mercy dealt with the losing hand  
Will he ever fall?  
Can he end it all?  
Our savior must make his stand  
  
Only a Propher of years to come  
Wanting mortality I'm all alone  
He heard my voice  
It was my choice  
I've stopped the Killing Hand  
  
When I go back again  
Will it be the same?  
I've stopped the cries  
But now they know my name  
  
The sea is calling me  
My spirit must return  
As I get closer,  
Was it really worth  
What I have learned?  
  
I'm in the valley  
And the saddened chimes I hear  
Race towards the wall to find  
One more name appears  
  
No one is left now  
My one and only land  
I laugh at what I've done  
I am the Killing Hand
