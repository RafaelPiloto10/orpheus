Hello all you boys and girls  
I'd like to take you to the inside world  
It's quite an irregular place to be  
But never fear you're safe with me  
  
Well, maybe  
  
Golden hair of macrame  
Against the face that's cut from stone  
The white porcelain is screaming ayee  
  
Thank god the boy is not alone  
  
I don't believe in Santa Claus  
I don't believe in spite  
I have no use for beauty dolls  
Especially on this night  
  
I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in lies  
I don't believe in hologram  
For I am the Frizzle Fry  
  
Andy's painting green again  
This time they might take him away!  
  
When Barrington starts to breathe again  
It may just take us all away!  
  
I don't believe in charity  
I don't believe in sin  
And if you don't believe in me  
We'll play this tune over again  
  
I don't believe in pinochle  
And I don't believe I'll try  
I do believe in Captain Crunch  
For I am the Frizzle Fry  
  
Yes I am the Frizzle Fry
