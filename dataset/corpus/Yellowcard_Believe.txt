Think about the love inside the strength of heart  
Think about the heroes saving life in the dark  
Climbing higher, through the fire  
Time was running out  
Never knowing you weren't going to be coming down alive  
But you still came back for me  
You were strong and you believed  
  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Be strong, believe  
(Be strong, believe)  
  
Think about the chance I never had to say  
Thank you for giving up your life that day  
Never fearing, only hearing voices calling out  
Let it all go, the life that you know  
Just to bring them down alive  
And you still came back for me  
You were strong and you believed  
  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Be strong, believe  
  
Want to hold my wife when I get home  
Want to tell my kids they'll never know  
How much I love to see them smile  
Want to make a change right here, right now  
Want to live a life like you somehow  
To make your sacrifice worth while  
  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Everything is going to be alright  
Be strong, believe
