You're the light  
That shooting start that's in the sky  
How did I. Get to be by your side  
I say these words tonight,  
You are my pure daylight  
I want to stay with you,  
And love my life away it's a brand new day  
It seems like heaven  
When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
Girl I smile, Cause you let  
Everybeat of my heart  
Feels so right, With you I have  
A brand new start  
Your beauty is in my eyes,  
My heart I can't deny  
I want to stay with you, And love my life away  
It's brand new day  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
Your beauty is in my eyes,  
My heart I can't deny  
I want to stay with you, And love my life away  
It's brand new day  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world
