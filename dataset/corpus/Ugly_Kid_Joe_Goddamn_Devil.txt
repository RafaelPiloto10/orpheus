Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery  
These are things that will bring you to me  
Murder and theft and all of the above  
You can bet your life I know what you're thinking of  
I've takin' you and I'll take your friends  
Don't worry, we'll all meet in the end  
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die  
Trust me baby cause I don't lie  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil and I do it for free  
  
I know the story about your life  
If you killed your brother or you beat your wife  
And I am here to punish you  
You can't fool me cause I ain't no fool  
The time has come to say goodbye  
The end is here for those who cheat, steal and lie  
There will be torture and there will be pain  
Cause this is hell, baby, die in flames.  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, Satan if you please  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, and I do it for free  
  
I don't care about you, don't care about your life  
Don't care about your children or about your wife  
I'm here to do my job so if you broke the law  
You're checking in with me  
But you can never leave  
  
There's one way out if you dare  
We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hell  
As Satan's child you'll start a band  
And spread the word across the land  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, Satan if you please  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, better believe in me (only me)  
I'm the Goddamn Devil!
