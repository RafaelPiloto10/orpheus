My little girl  
Won't you come with me  
Come with me  
And tell me  
Is there something to do  
I'm going crazy with boredom  
Come with me  
Tell me  
Grey sky over a black town  
I can feel depression  
All around  
You've got your leather boots on  
I can't stand another drink  
It's surprising this town  
Doesn't sink  
You've got your leather boots on  
Your pretty dress is oil stained  
From working too hard  
For too little  
You've got your leather boots on  
You're feeling the boredom too  
I'd gladly go with you  
I'd put your leather boots on  
I'd put your pretty dress on
