I went down to the highway  
That runs between love and pride  
And I tried to get sideways  
Across the great divide  
But my mind's eye's on the key ring  
Crying in misery  
'Cause it won't spend one more evening  
Staring back at me.  
  
It may be by choice or a small inner voice I can't say  
When you add up the cost we all have a cross  
How do you write off the loss?  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.  
  
The rules are unwritten  
And nobody knows the deal  
Where have I been driven  
Are deamons behind the wheel?  
Yeah, I know my days are numbered  
We're only flesh and bone  
And I've been left to wonder  
How it went so wrong.  
  
Is it all tailor made, can the sinner be saved, I can't say  
So don't hang your hat on the knife I'm my back  
'Cause nobody treats me like that.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.
