Yeah baby, I've been drinking,  
And I shouldn't come by I know  
But I found myself in trouble darling,  
And I had nowhere else to go  
  
Got some whiskey from a bar man,  
Got some cocaine from a friend  
I just had to keep on moving,  
Till I was back in your arms again  
  
Well I'm guilty, yeah I'm guilty,  
I'll be guilty for the rest of my life  
How come I never do,  
What I'm supposed to do  
How come nothing that I try to do ever turns out right  
  
Well you know how it is with me baby,  
You know I just can't stand myself  
It takes a whole lot of medicine,  
For me to pretend to be somebody else.
