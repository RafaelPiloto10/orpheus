[Dre]  
Remember back in the time  
When the only sign we had was pickets?  
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked  
Gangs killin' others fo' colors  
Thangs that we wear fo' fashion  
Other brothers take it fo' what reason? To be blastin'  
What da kcuf is goin' on?  
Not soft like buttercups but  
Had enough of singin' that same song  
See, I stayed across the street from the projects  
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk  
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite  
Only been to jail one week fo' some shull-bit  
And I pray to God I won't repeat  
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to  
No, I shouldn't a did that, cuz if I did that?  
Y'all would not hear that phat shit  
That keeps you on yo' tippy-toes  
Like that fella, not callin' no names  
But really, "who's bad?"  
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms  
You can't forget what you come from  
  
[T-Boz]  
Take a good look in the mirror  
And tell me, do you like what you see  
Masters of deception, corruption and evil  
But you're always quick to point the finger at me  
Won't somebody tell me  
  
1 - I just don't understand  
The ways of the world today  
Sometimes I feel  
Like there's nothing to live for  
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday  
  
[T-Boz]  
What gave you the right to misjudge me  
And write me off on the wall  
Acting as if you understand me  
In reality, you just don't know me at all  
  
[Chilli]  
Sometimes I can't help but wonder  
If this was how it's meant to be  
But if you search deep enough in your soul  
You'll always find a slight reminder of me  
Won't somebody tell me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Left Eye]  
A-yo, if we could all agree  
To lettin' our souls become free  
Of that sweet bitterness  
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?  
I keep misfocusin' my needs  
And distress on my back with them cats  
They be blastin' into my knapsack  
Ain't no accidental deathtraps  
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap  
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go  
My mind is ready to flow, didn't you know?  
First you catch and then I throw  
It's my own sense of time  
If I'm late, it's 'cuz I'm endin' my day  
Just when the sun shines  
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon  
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension  
  
Repeat 1
