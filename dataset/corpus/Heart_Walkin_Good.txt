Below the bridge the water rose on by  
Trouble's gone and time is on my side  
Been living in my ordinary shoes  
Walkin' off my ordinary blues  
  
Once upon a love so bright and true  
The weather changed, it went to Sunday School  
Once upon a dark and stormy day  
The promises dried up and blew away  
  
I found myself a brand new neighborhood  
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm walkin' good  
Take tomorrow, I'm giving up the past  
Nothing but a hobo walkin' good at last  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below
