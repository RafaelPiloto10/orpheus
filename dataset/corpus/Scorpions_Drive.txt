Who's gonna tell you when, it's too late  
Who's gonna tell you things, aren't so great  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna pick you up, when you fall  
Who's gonna hang it up, when you call  
Who's gonna pay attention, to your dreams  
Who's gonna plug your ears, when you scream  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna hold you down, when you escape  
Who's gonna come around, when you break  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight
