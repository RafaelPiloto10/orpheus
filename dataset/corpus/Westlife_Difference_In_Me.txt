There's something in the silence  
I never used to feel  
There's something about knowing  
That tells you this is real  
When you're close  
All I know I don't want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello happiness  
Tell me where you've been  
I missed the sound of your voice  
Missed the touch of your skin  
It's no secret I'm Not who I used to be  
Anyone can see  
You're the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
  
I'm standing at your doorstep  
Let me look into your eyes  
We could strip away the secrets  
Between you and me tonight  
  
Won't you say it's OK  
Let the world just fade away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
The difference  
When you're close all I know I don't want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
There's something in the silence I never used to feel
