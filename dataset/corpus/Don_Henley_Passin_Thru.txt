It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
Stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
Yes, one chord that rings true  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
Cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin'  
From the peace within the noise  
  
I have turned my back on hatred  
Lyin', prejudice and greed  
Found the future in the present  
Found hope within a seed  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
There's one chord that rings true  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have seen my bucket empty  
Seen my well run dry  
But there's water down the road  
And I'm only goin' by  
  
If I'm settin' on dead ready  
When my chances come to knock  
I'll make it where I'm going  
Standin' tall just like a rock  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
There's one chord that rings true  
It's a wicked world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
Yeah, it's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
I have stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
I have cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin'  
From the peace within the noise  
  
I have turned my back on hatred  
Lyin', prejudice and greed  
Found the future in the present  
Found hope within a seed  
  
I have seen my bucket empty  
I have seen my well run dry  
But there's water down the road  
And I'm only goin' by  
  
If I'm settin' on dead ready  
When my chances come to knock  
I'll make it where I'm going  
Standin' tall just like a rock  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
Passin' thru, passin' thru
