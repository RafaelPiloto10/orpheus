Gambler ambled down a country lane  
Looking for a game of chance  
She was twenty-one or two  
And she knew what she wanted  
And she wanted that gamblin' man  
  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
She was determined that she wanted Bill  
They'd all be offended at the mention still  
If they heard this song, which I doubt they will  
  
And my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No, no, nevertheless  
I said my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter, don't marry that gamblin' man."  
  
Gambler tried to be a family man  
Though it didn't suit his style  
He thought he had him a winning combination  
So he took us where the stakes were high  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
Never kept their disappointment hid  
They all went to pieces when the bad luck hit  
Stuck in the middle, I was the kid  
  
And my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No, no, nevertheless  
M-m-m-m-m-mama couldn't be persuaded  
When my Grannie pleaded with her  
Not to marry that gamblin' man.  
  
I said my mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama  
M-m-m-Mama couldn't be persuaded when they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."
