How come you never know  
What you got until it's gone  
Too bad  
Because I never felt so good with anyone  
How fooled was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
  
So every day I try a little harder  
To forget her  
Lie here convince myself  
Tomorrow will be better  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
Love is what the trouble is  
Love is what the trouble is  
  
How come she said  
You never wear your heart  
Where I can see  
Too bad  
'Cause now I'm the one  
Who's sorry  
How stupid was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
So everyday I find a little something  
To remind me  
No matter how I try  
I can't put the past behind me  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
  
Love has let me go  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
I'll be fine, give it time  
  
But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone (she's gone)  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)  
And now I know what it is (yes I do)  
And now I know what it is  
'Cause love is what the trouble is  
The trouble  
Love, love is what the trouble is
