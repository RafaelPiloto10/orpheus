Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play  
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass  
The drummer man's a cat they call Kickin' McCoy  
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy?  
Mama's cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease  
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece  
  
Well, there's a place you really get your kicks  
It's open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece  
  
There's a place you really get your kicks  
It's open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece
