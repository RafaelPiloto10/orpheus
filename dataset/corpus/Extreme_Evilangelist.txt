Little lamb come out of the rain  
You'll catch your death in the cold  
A helping hand, come ease your pain  
In peace, you'll rest in our fold  
I can be a watch towering light  
For all those who can't see  
I'll separate the truth from the lies  
Blind faithful, come follow me  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
In what God you trust  
Close your eyes while I hypnotize  
A friend in need to confess  
You've been denied, the cock crowed thrice  
Surrender all you possess  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
I was betrayed by a kiss  
So many claim to come in thy name  
Promising peace they'll bring  
Lest you taste the fruit of the vine  
They're just wolves in sheep's clothing  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
In what God you trust
