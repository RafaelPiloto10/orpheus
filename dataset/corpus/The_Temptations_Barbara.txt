Barbara  
Barbara, my love  
  
If Barbara were an angel  
I pray she'd watch over me  
If Barbara were a queen  
Her servant I would be  
  
If Barbara would be mine  
And wear my high school ring  
Then I'd climb the highest mountain  
Do just anything  
  
If Barbara were the winter chill  
I'd stand out in the cold  
If Barbara were a tree  
Her branches I would hold  
  
If Barbara would love me  
And say that she'd be mine  
I'd swim the deepest ocean  
Stop the hands of time  
  
Barbara please say  
(That you're the one in love with me)  
Don't let me lead  
(This life, this life of misery)  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Let me kiss your tender lips  
And know your secret charms  
And let me know what real love is  
And hold you in my arms  
  
And if this love I pray for  
Should it all come true  
Then with all my heart, dear  
I'd love no one but you  
  
I'll hold you in my arms  
For now and ever more  
And we will walk together  
Through love's sacred door  
  
Barbara  
Barbara  
Barbara, my love  
  
Barbara  
Barbara  
Barbara, my love  
  
Barbara  
Barbara
