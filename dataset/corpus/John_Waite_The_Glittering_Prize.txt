There's a silent movie  
Running off its reel inside my mind  
As I try to fall asleep tonight  
On prescription lullabies  
In the darkness there's a doorway  
That leads me back to you forever  
But these days there's only  
You and I in photographs  
Ambitions and dreams we've shared  
Now I wonder who has got the last laugh  
Cause I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
Got no expectations for my pride  
And I reach for that glittering prize  
I remember on our wedding day  
Looking back at you  
Our eyes met and we said goodbye  
As we both said "I do"  
Didn't I make a promise baby  
I would stand by you forever  
But sometimes the best-laid plans  
Flare up and blow away  
And fairytale logic comes  
Sweeps you heart  
Your soul' your world away  
Cause I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
And I'm tired of living with that lie  
And now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
But I feel for you  
I've got desire  
So I reach for that glittering prize  
No doll's house dreams  
Or valentines  
Just the future at the door  
Just leaving trains and empty rooms  
A broken band of gold  
Cause love don't live here anymore  
And some nights I'll come and see you  
And I know you'll let me in  
Two strangers in silence now  
Cause you know in love  
We could never win  
I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
And I'm tired of living with this lie  
These days  
Cause now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
Cause I feel for you  
I've got desire  
Baby baby  
In my world (in your world tonight)  
Reach for that glittering prize (in my world)  
That's all I ever seemed to do (in your world tonight)  
Was reach for the glittering prize (in my world)  
I lost myself when I lost you (in your world tonight)  
As I reached for that glittering prize (in my world)  
And I hope that all your dreams come true (in your world tonight)  
When you reach for that glittering prize (in my world)  
In your world  
In my world tonight
