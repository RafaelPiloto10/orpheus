A thousand years I've roamed the plains  
And waved the hand of doom  
I've seen the tears that fall  
Like rain from the waste and all that ruin  
A shadow's cast from me to you  
A time to claim  
All that's mine, my wrath is blind  
The balance is where you hang  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
The cries of sadness never heard  
Fall deaf upon my ears  
The stench of madness, raging wars  
I've seen a million years  
The smell of sorrow fills the fields  
And lingers in the sky  
The littered ground will swallow down  
The souls that fill my eyes  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker
