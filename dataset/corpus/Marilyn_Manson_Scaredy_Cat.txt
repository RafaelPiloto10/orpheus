I am your monster to devour  
You can see the smiles on the ones I have deflowered  
What can you say?  
What will you do?  
Your bark is bigger than the bite  
Of the dog shadow eating you  
I can see you, you can't hide  
I am the maggot in the apple of your eye  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
I can't believe in you  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...
