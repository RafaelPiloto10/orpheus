Girl, you've never known no one like me  
Up there in your high society  
They might tell you I'm no good  
Girl they need to understand  
Just who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
I may be a real bad boy  
But baby I'm a real good man  
  
I may drink too much and play too loud  
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd  
That don't mean I don't respect  
My mama and my Uncle Sam  
Yes sir, yes ma'am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Might have a reckless streak  
At least a country mile wide  
If you're gonna run with me  
It's gonna be a wild ride  
When it comes to lovin' you  
I've got velvet hands  
I'll show you how a real bad boy  
Can be a real good man  
  
I'll take all the good times I can get  
I'm too young for growing up just yet  
Ain't much I can promise you  
Except to do the best I can  
I'll be damned  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
