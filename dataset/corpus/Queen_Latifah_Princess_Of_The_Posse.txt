Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me  
Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me  
Biting's against the law in the place that I live  
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib  
The call me the high priestess of this hasta  
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta  
There's never been a word I can't master  
I've always been, a piddly pastor  
I reign, the lesson of today  
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say  
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side  
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern  
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn  
Let me know now if you'd like to protest  
And proceeding a greeting, or would you rather progress  
Onto a higher plateau, to the peak and I'm taking it slow  
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know  
I'm the Q-you-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H  
Queen of the R.E. Posse the GLA which is  
Get Live Alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails  
Nervous, watching me doing the live thing  
Singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring  
I'm the Queen and you're the underling  
I'm never following, I follow none  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand  
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land  
It's a concoction, for my ability  
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility  
Cause they don't know I'm the one to fly one or two  
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to  
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip  
I'm kicking gold so grab a hold and get a good grip  
Stop the lying, the trying  
The time buying, you've been denying  
You're dependent on me, the princess of the posse  
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow  
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease  
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King to the posse  
Peace, got to let you know where I come from  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
Now take run the family  
Me say me have to do it for the R.E. posse  
You try to be down, you can't take the crown  
Maybe from someone else but not me (Repeat 2x)
