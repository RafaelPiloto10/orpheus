She was a hot blooded women, he never saw it comin'  
She hit him from the side that's blind  
She never gave a warning, he woke up in the mornin'  
Layin' there next to his pride  
He got a little crazy when she had a little baby  
'Cause it filled him with a fatherly pride  
But a couple years later when their love started fadin'  
He hurt so bad he nearly died  
  
[Chorus]  
It's been a long time, since I was faithful  
It's been a long time, since I was grateful  
It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye  
It's been a long time, since I was grateful  
  
She's a mother with a daughter, sittin' by the water  
'Cause it's better for her baby to breathe  
She got a man that's in prison cause he didn't wanna listen  
Now he's sittin' waitin' on a reprieve  
And she loves her lil' baby but she get a lil' crazy  
'Cause it's harder than she ever conceived  
He left her on her own, but she's doin' it alone  
Cause she loves him like he wouldn't believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's a friend and a lover, husband and a brother  
He's always been a prodigal son  
He gets a lot of drama when he go to see his momma  
'Cause he curses like a son of a gun  
He's beggin' to his lady, let him see his baby  
He swears that she's the only one  
He's got a heart full of sorrow, he's livin for tomorrow  
And he's sorry for the damage he's done  
  
[Chorus x2]
