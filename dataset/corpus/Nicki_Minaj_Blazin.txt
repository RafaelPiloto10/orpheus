[Chorus]  
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,  
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing  
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,  
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing  
  
Feels like I'm bl'  
  
How could it me, little me  
Had the power to be the best B, in the league  
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me  
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly  
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations  
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em  
The contract is on but I am the addendum  
So wh-where my dogs at, Randy  
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy  
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy  
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi  
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show  
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal  
Before the storm comes the calm  
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,  
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha  
I'm the best now,  
Anybody with some money should invest now  
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'  
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel  
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been  
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win  
I'm on that different type of high, heroin  
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ugh, yea, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak  
While I'm flying with a flow that  
Is the greatest throwback  
Since that Nolan Ryan and the days  
Been crazy and the nights even wilder  
And the lights even brighter,  
Baby stand next to my fire  
Only higher is Messiah  
Or notes from Mariah  
'Rari six hundred horses,  
That's my chariot of fire?  
Where we flying,  
They can't find us all them broke days behind us  
I just took your whole life and redesigned it ugh  
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld  
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell  
I'm a grab your waist then,  
I'm a grab your face and  
Then I'm a taste it,  
Then I'm a blaze it  
Hello all my bad girls,  
This just in  
Yeezy hurt the beat  
Like he fucked her best friend  
And she let him back in  
And he just did it again,  
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end  
I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying  
Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him  
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze  
Her dress is just per' uh  
Prada colored babes  
It obvi' we the ish  
And I'm rolling with my bricks  
So real you so trill baby everything legit  
How you feel, they say we crazed  
Cause our styles so diff'  
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'  
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch  
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib  
Add this, we blazin'  
Nicki what you think,  
I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]
