Revenge is sweet and I can't wait  
Walk down the street, girl don't be late  
  
Now I don't want your sympathy  
So don't go sheddin' no tears  
For ev'ry wrong that you did to me  
I'll give you back in fear  
  
Now it's too late for apologies  
You've been through this trick before  
A million lies that you laid on me  
You knocked me down on the floor  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
It's a grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you'll find  
  
You had the chance to put things right  
But you preferred to be cruel  
I'm sick of pleadin' on my knees  
I'm tired of watchin' you drool  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
This is one grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you'll find  
  
Revenge is sweet and I can't wait  
Walk down the street, girl don't be late  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
This is one grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you"ll find  
  
Revenge is sweet, revenge is sweet
