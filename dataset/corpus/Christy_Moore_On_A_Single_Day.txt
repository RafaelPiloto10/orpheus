A list of exports from Cork Harbour  
On a single day  
The fourteenth of September, Eighteen Forty-Seven  
Ran as follows:  
  
147 barrels of pork,  
986 casks of ham,  
27 sacks of bacon,  
528 boxes of eggs,  
1, 397 firkins of butter,  
477 sacks of oats,  
720 sacks of flour,  
380 sacks of barley,  
187 head of cattle,  
296 head of sheep, and  
4, 338 barrels of miscellaneous provisions,  
On a single day,  
The ships sailed out from Cork Harbour  
With their bellies in the water.  
On a single day in County Galway,  
The great majority of the poor located there  
  
Were in a state of starvation,  
Many hourly expecting death to relieve their suffering.  
  
On a single day,  
The Lady Mayoress held a ball  
At the Mansion House in Dublin  
In the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  
Dancing continued until the early hours,  
And refreshments of the most varied and sumptuous  
Nature  
Were supplied with inexhaustible profusion.  
On a single day.  
On a single day.  
  
It's about time this little country of ours had a bit  
Of peace.
