I am a woman  
Cut in two  
By ambitious pride  
Stuck in my ways  
Between you and my other life  
  
Now I have been around enough to know when love has ended  
And I believe that you and I deserve to be extended  
  
Why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself  
  
Our empty house  
You occupy  
When I'm far away  
Heavier hearts won't justify why I'm gone today  
  
Now I have hung a cloud above our house from always leaving  
I figured you would at least make me give a better reason  
  
Why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself  
  
In the early mornings when I'm up before dawn  
Say "why don't you stay" but you keep sleeping on  
Maybe you're just too used to me being gone  
'Cause if you know that I go when I go  
  
Then why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself.
