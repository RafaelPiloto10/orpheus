If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
You know I tried to treat you right  
But, you stay out, stay out every night  
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me  
I know I laughed when you left  
But now I know I only hurt myself  
Baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it home to me  
I'll give you jewelry and money too  
That ain't all, all I do for you  
Baby if you bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, oh honey  
You know I'll always be your slave  
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave  
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me  
But I forgive you, yeah
