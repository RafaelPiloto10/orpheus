We're standing like kids on a mineway  
Two hearts like tumbling dice  
We've lost control of the way we feel  
  
Old heartaches driving us crazy  
Is it really different this time  
We've come too far not to take a chance  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Or is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Round and round our dreams are rollin?  
Will they land on lover goodbye  
My heart?s on you head over heels  
  
All I know is when I told you  
Love is worth any chance we take  
Baby let's left the chips fall were they make  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Maybe this is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Love is worth any chance we take  
Baby let's spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Or maybe this is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Keep on spinning the wheel baby  
Round and round we go  
Spin in the wheel  
Spin the wheel  
  
Round and round we go  
And spin the wheel  
Spin the wheel
