And all around  
At the side of the grave  
Stood Charlie's friends  
Who could not save  
This stupid girl  
From the way she behaved  
But among the mourners  
And the frowners  
A cry were heard...(aaaargh!)  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
Your downers are gone  
They was all you could get  
To ease your mind  
And your deep regret  
Over Charlie's mouth  
So enormous 'n wet  
Now all you got  
Is your TV set  
You turn it on  
And watch and dream  
A dream of love  
On the tiny screeen  
And what do you see  
As you lay in bed?  
It's a bald kinda girl  
With a pointed head  
Oh no...
