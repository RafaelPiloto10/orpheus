Well I spied a berry bush as I was strolling home one day  
And somehow it brought back the bygone days  
Of when you and I were berry picking many years ago  
In a little county not so far away  
  
How well I do remember the day when we first met  
It leaves a picture in my mind I never can forget  
  
[Chorus]  
We were picking berries at Old Aunt Mary's  
When I picked a blushing bride  
As we strolled home together, I just wondered whether  
I could win you forever if I tried  
Then at love's suggestion, I popped the question  
And asked you to be mine  
By your kisses I knew, you'd picked me and I'd picked you  
At berry picking time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well how sweet you were that day, in your simple gingham gown  
To me you were as lovely as a Queen  
When from underneath your bonnet popped a pair of golden curls  
And the bluest eyes that I have ever seen  
Your lips were red as cherries, the taste was twice as sweet  
It only took one kiss to make my happiness complete  
  
[Chorus]
