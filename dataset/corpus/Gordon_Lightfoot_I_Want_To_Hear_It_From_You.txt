I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from someone who knows how it is  
All the second-hand words seem to get in my way  
I want to hear it from you  
  
I want to hear it again  
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips  
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives  
  
I've got a right to get it straight from you  
To give my life a different point of view  
To find a way to keep from losing you  
  
If you don't know what to say  
To understand is my life and the question is why  
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away  
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you  
Let me know how you feel  
You've got to make up your mind  
Tell me where I can run  
When my roof tumbles in  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you
