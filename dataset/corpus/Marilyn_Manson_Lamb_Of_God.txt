There was Christ in the metal shell  
There was blood on the pavement  
The camera will make you god  
That's how jack became sainted  
  
If you die when there's no one watching  
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten  
But But if they kill you on their T.V.  
You're a martyr and a lamb of god  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
  
There was Lennon in the happy gun  
There were words on the pavement  
We were looking for the lamb of god  
We were looking for Mark David  
  
If you die when there's no one watching  
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten  
But if they kill you on their T.V.  
You're a martyr and a lamb of god  
  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
  
It took three days for him to die  
The born again to buy the serial rights  
Lamb of god have mercy on us  
Lamb of god will you grant us  
  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
  
If you die when there's no one watching  
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten  
But if they kill you on their T.V.  
You're a martyr and a lamb of god  
  
Nothing's gunna change the world
