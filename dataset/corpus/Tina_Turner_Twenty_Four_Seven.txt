Some folks say there's a price on love  
Watch your freedom go, watch your freedom go  
Just can't breathe with your head in the glove  
Watch your freedom go, baby I don't know  
But how can they mean it  
How come they give it up  
How long until they see  
The modern laws of lovin' don't apply to me  
  
Twenty Four Seven, stay here with me  
Twenty Four Seven, throw away the key  
Twenty Four Seven, I don't want to be free  
  
You get by if you kiss and tell  
Hear the people say, hear the people say  
Two strong hearts gotta share one cell  
Hear the people say but it ain't my way  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
I'll give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I don't need parol  
  
Twenty four seven, stay here with me  
Twenty four seven, throw away the key  
Twenty four seven, I don't want to be free, free, free  
Twenty four seven, around the clock  
Twenty four seven, I never want it to stop  
Twenty four seven, mm, here with me  
  
I'm gonna count the time  
That you're gonna be mine  
Seven days a week  
Twenty four hours ain't enough for me  
  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
I'm gonna give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I don't need parol  
  
Twenty four seven, stay here with me  
Twenty four seven, throw away the key  
Twenty four seven, I don't want to be free, free, free  
Twenty four seven, stay here with me, with me  
Twenty four seven, throw away the key, the key  
Twenty four seven, I want to twenty four seven with you, you, you, you you,  
Twenty four seven, non-stop love  
Twenty four seven  
Twenty four seven  
I want you twenty four seven
