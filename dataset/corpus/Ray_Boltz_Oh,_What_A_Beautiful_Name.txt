Oh, What A Beautiful Name  
Words [Chorus:] by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan, Verses by Jean Perry, Music
by Steve Millikan, Adapted from the hymn, "That Beautiful Name"  
chorus:  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh what a beautiful name  
Jesus, Jesus  
Forever will be the same  
I know of a name a beautiful name  
That angels brought down to earth  
To a maiden of lowly birth  
chorus (repeat)  
I know of a name a beautiful name  
That unto a baby was given  
The stars glittered bright  
Throughout that glad night  
And angels praised God in heaven
