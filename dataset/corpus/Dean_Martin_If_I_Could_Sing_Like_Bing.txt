If I could sing like Bing  
How happy I would be  
Babababoo  
If I could sing like Bing  
Perhaps you'd go for me  
Babababoo

Now everyone agrees  
That Bing's fun to hear  
And if I don't do quite as well just make believe he's near  
If I could sing like Bing  
For ever more you'd hear  
Babababoo, babababoo, babababoo  
Babababoo, babababoo, babababoo  
(If he could sing like Bing  
How happy he'd be)

Perhaps you'd go for him)  
Babababoo, babababoo  
Now everyone agrees

And if I don't do quite as well just make believe he's near  
(If he could sing like Bing)
