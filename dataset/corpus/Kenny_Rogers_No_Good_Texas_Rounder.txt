Excuse me ma'm, I'd like your daughter's hand for the evenin'  
There's a new band in town, I'd like to take her down to see 'em  
The fiddle player used to be my neighbour  
And he never slept a day in his life  
He plays a Strawberry Roan  
When he gets goin' he can play all night  
  
And her mama said, he's a no good Texas cowboy, child  
He'll love you up and he'll drive you wild then he'll lea-eave you  
He's a no good Texas rounder, girl  
Got a one-track mind and it ain't on true love and that's for sure  
She said I met his kind before, I met your kind before-ore  
  
Excuse me ma'm, I'd like your daughter's hand for the evenin'  
My intentions are good, I'm a man of honour  
Please ignore any rumors that have blackened my name  
I'm just an innocent boy, how could I be to blame  
We'll be late for the show and I took her hand and said let's go  
  
And her mama said, he's a no good Texas cowboy, child  
He'll love you up and he'll drive you wild, then he'll lea-eave you  
He's a no good Texas rounder, girl  
Got a one-track mind and it ain't on true love and that's for sure  
She said I met his kind before, I met your kind before-ore  
  
Excuse me ma'm, I'd like your daughter's hand for the evenin'  
I think you know the band, I'd like to take her down to see 'em  
I've been led to understand the fiddler was your man  
That's why he never slept a day in his life  
He'd play the Strawberry Roan  
Just to get you goin' then he'd play all night  
  
And the daughter said, he was a no good Texas fiddlin' man  
He'd love you up and he'd drive you wild then he'd lea-eave you  
He was a no good Texas rounder, girl  
Had a one-t
