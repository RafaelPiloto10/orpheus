Me, I'm just a simple guy  
And no matter how hard I try  
I may never show you how I feel  
  
You may be the woman I love  
I sometimes think that you've been sent from above  
I am trying to be a man  
Heaven knows, I do the best that I can  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
Me, I'll be a shoulder to cry on  
I'll be someone you can rely on  
And maybe you may see just how I feel  
  
We may be so far apart  
But you still know I've got a hungry heart  
We must be patient, it won't last forever  
It won't be long until we're together  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be strong, I'll show you how love can be  
I'll never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
We must be patient, it won't last forever  
It won't be long until we're together  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be strong, I'll show you how love can be
