Don't give me your problems  
I got plenty of my own  
Everyday you come around here  
Giving me your own set of moans  
I don't want a situation  
Going nowhere I ain't planned  
So you better listen here  
While I try and make you understand  
  
No rules no ties  
No rules no lies  
  
Take me as you see me  
Take me any way I am  
I'm no victim man  
I'll just come and see you if I can  
I don't want no long term ties  
Fantasise two-faced lies no way  
So you better listen here  
While I try to make you understand  
  
Chorus
