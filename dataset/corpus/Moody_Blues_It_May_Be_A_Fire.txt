It may be a fire,  
Tomorrow it could be nothing.  
It may reach out to the sky,  
Light up everything that you know.  
Everywhere you go from now  
You will see better than before.  
People you've not known for years  
Will come knocking at your door.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
It may be a warm wind  
That tries to blow your heart away.  
It may walk into your life,  
Tell you everything that you know.  
Looking down through all the years,  
Making plans that have gone past,  
Something you've not known for years  
But you knew that it would last.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
  
I'm turning all the answers  
Inside out,  
Looking for a love  
That reaches out,  
Or the fire into your heart  
  
It may be a fire,  
Tomorrow it may be nothing.  
It may reach up to the sky,  
Light up everything that I know,  
Everywhere I go from now  
I will see better than before  
  
People I've known for years  
Will come knocking at my door.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it,  
You gotta get it,  
You gotta get it into your heart.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it  
Into your heart.
