All you overloaded, candy coated?  
Your life's imploding now  
There's a risk worth taking, a pain worth aching  
On this hollow ground  
  
We can let go  
Don't hold on to all of life's hardest parts  
When we think of stopping, let's keep on rocking  
To the rhythm of our hearts  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
  
Find the magic, go and grab it  
Your fate is in your hands  
Come on, find a reason to believe  
And just tell yourself, "We can!"  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
  
Get off your seat, on your feet  
Raise your hands, feel the beat  
Let it go, lose control  
Feel it in your soul  
  
Don't you know what you can do  
If you have faith in you  
Let's not be invisible  
There's no red light in life, just go!  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
We can, we can, yeah!  
  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Good and broken
