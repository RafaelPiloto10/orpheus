The sky is changing  
The clouds are gathering, we can see  
It's growing darker day by day,  
But I'm so high  
  
Within this stormy weather  
God is the wind, could take my soul,  
Even as I pray.  
You with your lack of time  
  
Me with my lack of space,  
Where are you my love?  
Lost in your reckless dreams.  
I tried to share your garden of Eden,  
  
But temptation trims the wings of those  
Who only wish to know.  
Denied - stop looking for a reason,  
It's hard to face the time to fly,  
  
Harder still to go.  
You with your lust for time,  
Me with my lust for space,  
Where are you now my love?  
  
Lost in your restless dreams.  
And though we're strong and tough,  
Can our hearts open wide enough,  
To recognize the faults  
  
And then to smile?  
And though we tear each other's hearts and minds,  
We show no sense,  
We can still have our innocence,  
Like a Child.
