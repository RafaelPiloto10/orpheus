Thank you for the promises we make  
I know I can't complain  
I think I did all right  
No failures are in sight  
Only now and then  
I'd like to reminisce  
Do you remember when  
  
Even if we're angels we can't ask  
To wander through the past  
The future is our goal  
The night is black as coal  
If I could pay the price  
I'd like to love you once  
I'd love to love you twice  
  
Thanks  
We cannot say enough  
The road is sometimes rough  
But we can get along  
The going will get tough  
But we won't be afraid  
Of the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises you keep  
When I am fast asleep  
To be where we belong  
Is all that I can ask  
We can do it in the shade  
As long as I have you  
And the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises we break  
If you made a clean mistake  
Well that's what love's about  
No need to stand and shout  
The truth is in your eyes  
The answer lies within  
No need to criticize  
  
Thanks  
For the promises at hand  
The abuse that we must stand  
Is often heaven sent  
They may not pay the rent  
You never can be sure  
When promises get bent  
  
Thank you for the promises that live  
This is all that I can give  
Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss  
Forever in my soul  
I will remember this
