Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like there's something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
And I know someday I might be looking around  
Trying to find some purpose  
Well purpose it can't be that hard to find  
As long as I've got the wind  
The wind and your love to carry me  
  
Well tomorrow holds only mystery  
And who's to say what might be  
But I know in you I've found a love so strong  
The sun and the moon look on in jealousy  
In jealousy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like there's something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To carry me  
Please carry me
