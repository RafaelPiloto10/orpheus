You're looking at me why  
Sort of like a leper vibe  
Okay for your kind  
But it's too good for me  
  
And a hey I know I'm  
Never gonna qualify  
For all the bullshit  
Of your social degrees  
  
Oh look down your noses at me  
Hating my identity  
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see  
'Cause down here in Hell everybody loves me  
  
Hey I know I'm anti-social  
'Cause you act like I'm infected  
With some atrocity  
  
And though I know I'm  
Every bit the same inside  
My face don't fit  
It's like I've got some disease  
  
Oh you keep your face turned away  
To strip me of identity  
Oh still got my fortune and fame  
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)  
Nobody else invited me  
  
Now I belong  
I found my home  
'Cause even though I know things won't  
Get any better, they can certainly never get much worse  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)  
Nobody else invited me  
  
Say my whole life I've always been disliked  
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me  
And I don't know why you felt so justified  
In all the degradation that you dished on me  
  
Oh! Now my status has changed  
And you've got yourself to blame  
Oh! I'll grab all the attention I crave  
Now I'm running Hell, Heaven won't be the same  
  
Hell is home to me  
Might as well be  
I like it here and nowhere else invited me  
Hell is home to me  
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)  
Nobody else invited me
