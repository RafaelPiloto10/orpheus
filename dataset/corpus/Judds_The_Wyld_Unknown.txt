Everybody read about it  
You can find it in the checkout line  
They say I got husbands a-leavin', boyfriends a-callin'  
And problems that ain't even mine  
Well, all that trash don't bother me none  
It's all just part of the game  
I'm just a good-hearted down-home country girl  
And you all know my name  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I like to ride  
I need my space  
And I love being at home  
But if you wanna' get right into my heart  
Take a left at the wyld unknown  
The wyld unknown  
  
You don't wanna' cross my little mama  
And you sure don't wanna mess with me  
'Cause there's a wild streak running down from the roots  
To the top of my family tree  
I'm a woman of passion, a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth, I'm bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
The wyld unknown  
I'll show you somethin' that  
You ain't never been shown  
  
Whenever trouble finds me  
I always take my share of the blame  
I'm the kind of girl who can rock your world  
Or love you like a hurricane  
I'm a woman of passion, a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth, I'm bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
