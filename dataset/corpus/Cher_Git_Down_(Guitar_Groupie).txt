I'm a lady from the valley  
Coming out to check a band  
See I'm a crazy into rock and roll  
I got to have a guitar man  
  
I'm a sucker for his wa-wa  
He's a hottest act in town  
I know just how to push his pedal  
So you know I can git down  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a git down-guitar groupie  
And I live from riff to riff  
I'm a git down-guitar groupie  
Git down, downtown, lowdown  
Guitar groupie, well  
  
A guitar groupie, yeah  
  
Shady lady from the get go  
Watch me try to catch this man  
See how to lure him with my seductiveness  
Calling myself a fan  
  
What a funky reputation  
Is gonna follow me all over town  
For there's a one thing  
That he can say about his lady  
She really knows how to git on down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A woman on the road leads a lose and lovin' life  
My advice is to all you ladies  
Is you got to get around  
Set your sights on who you're after  
Feel the chords and git on down  
  
I'm a git down-guitar groupie  
And I live from lick to lick  
I'm a git down-guitar groupie  
  
Git down, downtown, lowdown, git down  
Git down, downtown, lowdown, git down  
Git down, downtown, lowdown, guitar groupie  
Well, a guitar groupie yeah  
Oh, a guitar groupie  
Ah guitar groupie yeah  
  
I got to git down on you mama  
Git down on him now  
Git down groupie wow wow wow  
  
Git down on you mama  
Git down on him now  
Git down groupie wow wow wow  
  
Git down on you mama  
Git down on him now  
Git down groupie wow wow wow
