Had an out of  
Body experience  
The other day  
Her name was Jesus  
And for her everyone cried  
Everyone cried  
Everyone cried  
  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosophy die  
  
Crossed and terrored  
Ravages of architecture  
Lend me thy blades  
We're crossed and terrored  
Ravages of architecture  
Hoist around the spade  
  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosophy die  
  
Die, die, die, why  
Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go through our souls  
Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go all through our souls  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Why, like a motherfucker  
I want to fuck  
My way to the garden  
Cause everyone needs  
A motherfucker  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosphy die  
  
The following of a Christ [Repeat: x4]  
The falling of Christ [Repeat: x4]
