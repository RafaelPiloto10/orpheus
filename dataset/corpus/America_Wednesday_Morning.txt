Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
I guess she figured it was better if she walked  
It could've been me just the same  
There's no winner in this game  
Oh, Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
Wednesday evening was the first time she cried  
It could've turned out different if I'd lied  
Something deep within us all  
Sees the writing on the wall  
Oh, Wednesday evening we didn't talk at all  
I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
It could've been me just the same  
There's no winner in this game  
Oh, Wednesday evening and nothing is the same  
(Oh) I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
Wednesday morning, yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away, yeah  
Wednesday morning, yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
Wednesday morning, yeah
