Closing time, open all the doors  
And let you out into the world  
Closing time, turn all of the lights on  
Over every boy and every girl  
Closing time, one last call for alcohol  
So finish your whiskey or beer  
Closing time, you don't have to go home  
But you can't stay here  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, time for you to go out  
To the places you will be from  
Closing time, this room won't be open  
Till your brothers or your sisters come  
So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits  
I hope you have found a friend  
Closing time, every new beginning  
Comes from some other beginning's end  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, time for you to go out  
To the places you will be from  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, every new beginning  
Comes from some other beginning's end
