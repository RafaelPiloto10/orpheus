I've seen you standing there stunned in the spotlight  
I've seen the sweat streak the pain on your face  
'Cause you're caught like a clown in a circle of strangers  
Who do you screw to get out of this place  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's one for the money  
And too far to go  
Three fingers of whiskey  
Just for the soul  
That lady you're pleasin'  
Is hungry and cold  
Don't look in her eyes  
You'll see what you sold  
  
Too many bodies in too many bars  
Too many feelings are fallin' behind  
'Cause you're easy to fool when you're lost in the stars  
Shoot out that spotlight before you go blind  
  
[Chorus]
