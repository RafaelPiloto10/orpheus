You've got to learn, you've got to learn how to follow the leader  
You've got to turn, turn off your pride and you're life will be sweeter  
Love comes from God, surely, surely, surely you can see that  
If you check out your heart, there's a part that you're keeping from me  
Why don't you hold on tight, make this flight, we've got the whole night  
Saddle up your gear, have no fear, we are here, hey  
Better make it soon, give me room, come on and stand by me  
Come on and stand by, cause there is no time, no time to sit  
I'll bet you'll be quick about it, and I know you will,  
Once you learn that you can't live without it  
Lord only knows how long, how long, how long I have waited  
And the moment is near, line em up, get em ready at the gate  
We're gonna keep em' strong, moving on, we've got the whole night  
No looking back, where its at, its right now, hey  
Better make it soon, give me room, come on and stand by me  
There's gonna be no looking back, so baby, take everything you'll ever need  
Sure 'nough moving on, keep it strong, its a whole new game and a brand new
street  
You know, uh, you said you would if you could, I'll make it good to ya  
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't
do, stand by me  
Hey, hey, if its real, what you feel, come on and stand by  
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't
do, stand by me  
Come on and stand by, ha, stand by me, hey, hey, hey  
[Repeat til fade]  
Stand by me
