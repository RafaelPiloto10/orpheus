You and I in this moment,  
Holding the night so close,  
Hanging on, still unbroken  
while outside the thunder rolls.  
Listen now you can her my heart beat  
warm against life's bitter cold.  
  
These are the days.  
the sweetest days we'll know.  
  
There are times that scare me.  
We'll rattle the house like the wind,  
both of us so unbending.  
We battle the fear within.  
All the while life is rushing by us.  
Hold it now and don't let go.  
  
These are the days.  
the sweetest days we'll know.  
  
So, we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness.  
Watching the stars till their gone.  
And when even the mem'ries have all faded away,  
these days go on and on.  
  
Listen now, you can hear my heartbeat.  
Hold me now and don't let go.  
(These are the days,)  
ev'ry day is the sweetest day we'll know.  
(These are the days,)
