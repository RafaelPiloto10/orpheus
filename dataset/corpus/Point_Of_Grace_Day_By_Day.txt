I'm not unhappy, but I'd take the train today  
If you'd let me, if you'd let me  
They may be clapping for me, but I wait  
For you to come get me, some come and get me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause day by day you're coming closer  
Making our way clearer and straighter  
Turning our faces into the light  
And I can't wait to fall at your glory  
On my face, god of the morning  
You're coming closer day by day  
  
Somebody told me I could travel the world  
To find beauty, to find beauty  
But to behold it I would have to carry it  
Within me, yeah well it's in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me a mission if I've still got the time  
'Cause I'm open, yeah I'm open  
Be my vision and I'll be your delight  
  
'Cause I'm goin' wherever you're goin'  
Turning faces into the light  
And I can't wait to fall at your glory  
On my face, god of the morning  
You're coming closer day by day  
  
[Chorus]
