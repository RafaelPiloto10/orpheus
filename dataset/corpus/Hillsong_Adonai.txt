I lift my voice, I lift my praise to You  
I lift my hands, I lift my worship to You  
And I love You more than I can say  
Oh, I love You more than I can say  
Adonai will see only You will I adore  
Glorify my Lord, only You will I serve  
For the world will fade away  
Still my song to You remains  
Only You will I adore  
I lift my voice, I lift my praise to You  
I lift my hands, I lift my worship to You  
And I love You more than I can say  
Oh, I love You more than I can say  
Adonai will see only You will I adore  
Glorify my Lord, only You will I serve  
For the world will fade away  
Still my song to You remains  
Only You will I adore  
Oh, I love You always  
Oh, I love You always  
Oh, I love You always  
Oh, I love You always  
Yes Lord  
Oh, I love You always  
Oh, I love You always  
Adonai will see only You will I adore  
Glorify my Lord, only You will I serve  
For the world will fade away  
Still my song to You remains  
Adonai will see only You will I adore  
Glorify my Lord, only You will I serve  
For the world will fade away  
Still my song to You remains  
Only You will I adore  
Only You will I adore  
Only You will I adore  
Only You will I adore
