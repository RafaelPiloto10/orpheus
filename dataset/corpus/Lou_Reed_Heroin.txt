I don't know just where I'm going  
But I'm goin' to try for the kingdom if I can  
'cause it makes me feel like I'm a man  
When I put a spike into my vein  
Then I tell you things aren't quite the same  
  
When I'm rushing on my run  
And I feel just like jesus' son  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess that I just don't know  
  
I have made very big decision  
I'm goin' to try to nullify my life  
'cause when the blood begins to flow  
When it shoots up the dropper's neck  
When I'm closing in on death  
  
You can't help me not you guys  
All you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all go take a walk  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess I just don't know  
  
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago  
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
I put on a sailor's suit and cap  
  
Away from the big city  
Where a man cannot be free  
Of all the evils in this town  
And of himself and those around  
Oh, and I guess I just don't know  
Oh, and I guess I just don't know  
  
Heroin, be the death of me  
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life  
Because a mainer to my vein  
Leads to a center in my head  
And then I'm better off than dead  
  
When the smack begins to flow  
Then I really don't care anymore  
About all the jim-jims in this town  
And everybody putting everybody else down  
And all of the politicians makin' crazy sounds  
All the dead bodies piled up in mounds, yeah  
  
Wow, that heroin is in my blood  
And the blood is in my head  
Yeah, the god's good as dead  
Ooohhh, God that I'm not aware  
I just don't care  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess I just don't know
