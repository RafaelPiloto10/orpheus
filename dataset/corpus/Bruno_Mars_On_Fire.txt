Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Ohhhh  
Oh (oh) Oh (oh oh)  
Keep crawling up touchin' ya', kissin' ya', lovin' ya'  
The ice is melting down your back  
Cause there's a flame between us  
Girl with every single touch  
It's like your body strikes a match  
I' ma need to  
Stop (stop)  
Drop (drop)  
And roll (roll)  
Cause baby girl your heat's out of control  
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)  
My body's a 100 degrees  
Every time you're standing next to me  
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)  
Girl you make me so hot  
I don't want it to stop, no  
Oh, you got me burning up

Feels like I'm on fire (fire)  
My temperature is higher  
I'm sweating with desire  
Feels like I'm on fire  
The smoke detector's going off  
The neighbour's gonna make the call  
The fire trucks are on their way (oh their way, oh!)  
Now we're both turning red  
We've been up and down the bed  
We don't care so we say  
I' ma need to  
Stop (stop)  
Drop (drop)  
And roll (roll)  
Cause baby girl your heat's (your heat's)  
Out of (out of) control (control)
