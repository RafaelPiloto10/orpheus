(S. Macgowan)  
  
I've been loving you a long time  
Down all the years, down all the days  
And I've cried for all your troubles  
Smiled at your funny little ways  
  
We watched our friends grow up together  
And we saw them as they fell  
Some of them fell into heaven  
And some of them fell into hell  
  
I took shelter from a shower  
And I stepped into your arms  
On a rainy night in Soho  
The wind was whistling all it's charms  
  
I sang you all my sorrows  
And you told me all your joys  
Whatever happened to that old song  
To all those little girls and boys  
Those little girls and boys  
  
Now the song is nearly over  
We may never find out what it means  
But there's a light I hold before me  
And you're the measure of my dreams  
The measure of my dreams  
  
These last two verses are not sung by Nick, but are part of the original song
as written by Shane Macgowan:  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the morning  
The gingerlady by my bed  
Covered in a cloak of silence  
I hear you in my head  
  
I'm not singing for the future  
I'm not dreaming of the past  
I'm not talking of the fist time  
I never think about the last  
  
Now the song is nearly over  
We may never find out what it means  
Still there's a light I hold before me  
You're the measure of my dreams  
The measure of my dreams
