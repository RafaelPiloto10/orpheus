How can you stand there and deny it?  
After all we have been through  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
And make a fool out of you  
  
Collapsing  
Like houses of cards  
And landing  
On splinters and glass  
  
Wish I could fake it like you do  
Wish I could fake it just like you  
  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
  
Trust me now  
  
Collapsing  
Like houses of cards  
And landing  
On splinters and glass  
  
They crush your heart  
But spare your feet  
Like judging people  
You've yet to meet  
Well time is running fast  
Upon your reflection  
  
Trust me now  
  
How can you stand there  
Stand and deny it?
