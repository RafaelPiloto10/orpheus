One of these Nights I'll shake you  
I will take you from my veins  
I'm gettin' tired of waiting  
It's time to empty me  
  
Chorus:  
We can rip apart this bleeding heart, don't you wanna watch me spill?  
Bleed you out again  
  
Feeling me reach inside you  
And I feel you run through me  
Funny how you remind me  
I got memories to drain  
  
Chorus X2  
  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Please oh, please oh, you're draining me  
I've got to bleed myself of you  
Please oh, please oh, you're draining me  
I've got to bleed, I've got to bleed for you  
  
Chorus X2
