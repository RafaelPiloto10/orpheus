Lord, I question whether I've had my fill  
Lord, I question whether I can take much more  
You may laugh as I lay here bleeding  
No more afters or befores  
Some day you'll know just how I feel  
You left me there twice before  
Some day you'll know just how it feels  
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride  
Like you were never nothing special  
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel  
So you say I'm just another dollar  
So you say I'm just another day yeah  
Once my blood was strong but now its jaded and its thin  
Unlike you I can still tell right from wrong  
Some day you'll know just how it feels  
While you left me there twice before  
Some day you'll know just how it feels  
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride  
Like you were never nothing special  
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel  
Some day you'll know just how it feels  
While you left me there twice before  
Some day you'll know just how it feels  
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride  
Like you were never nothing special  
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel
