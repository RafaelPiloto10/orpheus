No, you couldn't call Jesse a babe in the woods  
He's just weak in self-defense  
Cause he's so thin skinned  
He can't take a joke at his expense  
"You're a push down window," says Rowdy Yates  
"I can run you up and down  
Anytime I want  
I can make you my dancin'  
My dancin' clown!"  
You're my dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin'  
My dancin' clown  
Dancin'  
You're my dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin' dancin'  
My dancin' clown  
  
Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove  
He's all chide and snide and bluff  
Stuck in the romantic tradition  
Of acting rough and tough  
"You're always charging through," says Jesse  
Nervous, lookin' all around  
To see who's seein' him bein' a dancin'  
A dancin' clown  
He's a dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin'  
A dancin' clown  
Dancin'  
He's a dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin' dancin'  
A dancin' clown  
  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever love comes around  
Someone's a dancin' clown  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever hearts start to pound  
Someone's a dancin' clown  
  
Down the street comes last-word Suzie  
She's high yellow, lookin' top nice  
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades  
And the crackle of northern ice  
"Hot damn!" says Rowdy, lookin' up  
"Yum!" says Jesse lookin' down  
"How would you like to be her dancin'  
Her dancin' clown?"  
Be her dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin'  
Her dancin' clown  
Dancin'  
Be her dancin' clown  
Dancin' dancin' dancin'  
Her dancin' clown  
  
Cherchez la femme  
Whenever love comes to town  
Someone's a dancin' clown  
Cherchez la femme  
Wherever hearts start to pound  
Someone's a dancin' clown
