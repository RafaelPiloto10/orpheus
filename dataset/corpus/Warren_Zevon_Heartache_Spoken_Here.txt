When I was young  
The sky was filled with stars  
I watched them burn out one by one  
I've had my share  
Of disappointing love affairs  
And I'm no stranger to disillusionment  
Little darlin'  
If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
[Chorus]  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down, we'll talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down we'll talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
  
A house of cards  
A castle made of sand  
Don't take much to blow away  
Rows and rows  
Of broken hearts and broken homes  
So much sadness, you see it every day  
Little darlin' If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know it hurts so  
When the one you love don't need you  
I know the sorrow  
That a reckless heart can lead to  
  
[Chorus]
