They say if you took it all away  
This love would fall apart  
I say, no way  
You don't know the size of my heart.  
Vicious, suspicious  
It doesn't matter what I say  
Users and losers  
There's nothing here to make me stay.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain  
No gain with no pain  
My scars are deeper than you think  
Tie me, try me  
One more time before I sink.  
Big lies, big times  
This love is not what we're about  
It's too late, and I'm too straight  
It's time to blow this fire out.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take me softly  
I'm going crazy for your touch.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
(Blue, blood, blue, blood, blue, blood)  
Take it with no shame  
(No, take, no, take, no, take)  
I'm alone  
And dissatisfied  
And someone else is alone  
And dissatisfied  
You are alone?
