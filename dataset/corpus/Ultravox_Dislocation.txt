Running down an empty street  
Perhaps it was a railway station  
Smell of ??? cologne  
The sound of a celebration  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sun was going down one quiet evening  
Someone came into the room while I was half-asleep  
We spoke for a while, I couldn't see his face  
Later on when he was gone, I realized I didn't catch his name  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under
