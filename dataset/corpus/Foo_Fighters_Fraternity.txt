I'll never be fraternity  
Another disease fraternity  
Never believe fraternity  
Just armies bored in life  
  
I'll never be fraternity  
I'll never need that brand of me  
Fading the pace behind your eyes  
Free to be straight for shape and size  
Waiting awake and watch you rise  
Go on keep feeding  
  
Swearing by the  
Swearing father  
Swearing father  
  
I'll never be fraternity  
Another disease fraternity  
Never believe fraternity  
Just armies bored in life  
  
I don't believe fraternities  
See the disease fraternities  
Wait of the hate behind your eyes  
Free to be straight for shape and size  
Waiting awake and watch your rise  
Go on keep feeding  
  
Swearing by them  
Swearing father  
Swearing father  
  
I'll never be fraternity  
Another disease fraternity  
Never believe fraternity  
Just armies bored in life  
  
Hand me down  
  
I'll never be fraternity  
Another disease fraternity  
Never believe fraternity  
Just armies bored in life  
  
Bored in life  
Bored in life
