Yeah  
I feel you too  
Feel  
Those things you do  
In your eyes I see a fire that burns  
To free the you  
That's running through  
Deep inside you know  
Seeds I plant will grow  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah come on come on now take the chance  
That's right  
Let's dance  
Snake  
I am the snake  
Tempting  
That bite you take  
Let me make your mind  
Leave yourself behind  
Be not afraid  
I've got what you need  
Hunger I will feed  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
Haha  
Come dance  
Yeah, come dancing  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
Yeah  
I feel you too  
Feel  
Those things you do  
In your eyes I see a fire that burns  
To free the you  
That's running through  
Deep inside you know  
Seeds I plant will grow  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
That's right  
Let's dance  
Mm, it's nice to see you here  
Haha
