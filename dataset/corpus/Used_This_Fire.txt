True, we acted like we should  
And did all that we could  
When you pushed we never pulled  
We answered back yes anything  
We can give you anything  
  
Will you take everything?  
'Cause we do not need a thing.  
  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
Not fading away, not fading away.  
Our love, our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
  
Truth, we were never understood or acted like we should  
I cannot let you win, we don't owe you anything  
For we won't give you anything  
Try and take everything  
But we won't give you anything  
  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
Not fading away, not fading away.  
Our love, our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
  
Build a fire for yourself.  
  
We won't give you anything.  
  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me  
Not fading away, not fading away.  
Our love, our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning, it burns inside of me
