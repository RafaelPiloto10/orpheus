Where do you go when there's nowhere to go  
And you don't want to be where you are  
Where do you run when there's no run to run and you've already run too far  
What good is love when you offer your love but nobody wants to buy  
Why do I cry and why am I wondering why  
What can you say when there's so much to say but nobody listens to you  
And what good are dreams if there's no more than dreams  
That don't have a chance to come true  
And what can you do when love that you do will ease your troubled mind  
And where do you go when you come to the end of the line  
What can you say...
