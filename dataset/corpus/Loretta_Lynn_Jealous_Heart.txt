Jealous heart, oh jealous heart stop beating  
Can't you see the damage you have done  
You have driven him away forever  
Jealous heart, now I'm the lonely one  
I was part of everything he planned for  
And I know he loved me from the start  
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for  
All because of you, oh jealous heart  
  
Jealous heart, why did I let you rule me  
When I knew the end would bring me pain  
Now he's gone, he's gone and found another  
Oh I'll never see my love again  
Through the years his memory will haunt me  
Even though we're many miles apart  
It's so hard to know he'll never want me  
'Cause he heard your beating, jealous heart
