I don't want to ever fall in love again  
I don't want to worry if I'll hurt or hurt somebody  
You can't be happy when love comes to an end then you're alone  
I won't try to change again for a woman's sake  
'Cause I won't be around one who has rules for me to follow  
For when a love falls through it hurts and you will never be the same  
  
And it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just won't let it start  
'Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
  
It don't really matter why when love is gone  
If cheatin' is to blame or it died from natural causes  
The end is still the same it always causes pain at least to one  
  
And it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just won't let it start  
'Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
  
Yes, it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just won't let it start  
'Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
Yes, it takes too long to heal a broken heart
