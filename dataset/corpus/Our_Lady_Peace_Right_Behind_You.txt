You haven't seen the world outside for days  
You sleep, you hope, you wait  
Imagination disappears and all the dreams  
You have you save  
Confrontation like a mirror  
They try to take your mind away  
  
Pre-chorus:  
  
Hey, hey  
I don't know but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means to bleed  
And know that you're okay  
Are you waiting?  
  
Chorus:  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what I'm always right there behind you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bombarded by the atmosphere  
You breathe, you choke, you breathe again  
Conversation disappears you realize they're not your friends  
The panic of the future rears  
You dig, you jerk, you find another way
