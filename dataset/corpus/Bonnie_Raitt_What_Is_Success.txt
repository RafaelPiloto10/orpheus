How does one decide  
That the methods he's using,  
They just don't jive  
To truly believe and keep trying  
Over and over again  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
When will one change his mind  
And jump the fence  
For the dial a sign  
Its a sad thing, its a bad thing  
But so necessary  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Now what, what, (i don't know, can you tell me what)  
What is success?  
Is it do your own thing?  
Or to join the rest  
And if you truly believe it,  
And try over and over again  
Living in hopes  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success
