Singing ooh, said ooh, ooh lazy love  
  
Ooh my lobby call was 11:30  
I'm officially the opposite of early  
I gotta go downstairs (downstairs)  
Everybody waiting down there for me  
But I roll over into your curly (hair)  
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy (yeah)  
Reminiscing on last night  
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time before (before, before)  
I gotta go, I got responsibilities I gotta take care of,  
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa that's when you wrap them legs around me  
And I fall victim to that lazy love  
  
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna go nowhere, that lazy love  
Hey you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing, you got that lazy love  
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing, that lazy love  
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing  
  
Damn baby that was good, I'm gon' hit the shower  
Even though I'm about two hours, late  
But I can't help it man  
If they knew what I knew, they would understand (understand)  
I'm washing last night off, time to boss up  
When suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch  
She right behind me  
Water glisten off her body  
Looking at me, like "one more time"  
But baby I gotta go, I got responsibilities I gotta take care of,  
That's when you wrap them legs around me  
And I fall victim to that lazy love  
  
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna go nowhere, you got that lazy love  
Hey you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing, you got that lazy love  
Hey, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing, you got that lazy love  
Oh, you got that, I don't wanna  
That I don't wanna do nothing  
  
Ooh ooh I said ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh that lazy love  
Oh yeah
