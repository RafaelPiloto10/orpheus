Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye  
  
Feel so bad baby, oh it hurts me  
When I think of how you love and desert me  
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
Though I'm just one of your lovers  
And I know there are so many others  
You do something strange to me baby  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye  
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong  
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let go
