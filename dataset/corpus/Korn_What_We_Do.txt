Sometimes things get in the way  
My thoughts I cannot convey  
It's all pointing straight at you  
We hate loving everyday  
Our lives twirled in every way  
I give it all back to you  
  
I can't help this going down  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
  
Sometimes things don't go away  
In turn you just run away  
It's all coming back for you  
Betrayed, life is in decay  
Your thoughts you cannot obey  
Right now, what cha gonna do?  
  
I can't help this going down  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
  
We do, we do, we do, we do,  
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do  
  
I hear the calling of the helpless stranger  
He's all alone and no one hears his anger  
I feel his pain every time I'm here with you  
With you  
All the heartache and the fucked up insults  
I find you begging on your knees, I figured  
This is how it's supposed to be with you  
With you  
  
I can't wait for your life to be broken down  
I gave you hate  
  
Ah!  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
  
That's what we do
