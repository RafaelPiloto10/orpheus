Oh-ohh  
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, l-la, la, la, la, l-la, la, laa  
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, l-la, la, la, la, l-la, la, laa  
Every Friday  
My head's spinning round and round  
Been working all week now baby  
Yes, it's my day  
I take a trip downtown  
To my favourite club now, baby  
That's when I see you  
With loving arms to fall into  
But I'm not lookin' for full-time love  
There's still so much I wanna do  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
Can live without it  
I don't want a full-time love  
'cause it's not on my mind now, baby  
You know my freedom  
Is what I'm thinking of  
And I ain't got the time now, baby  
Straight out of the blue  
You came and asked me to  
Be your date in the daytime babe  
But I am sorry, no can do  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
Kiss me when the sun don't shine  
Kiss me when the sun don't shine, oh-woah  
(make some noise for the vengaboys)  
Oh-woah  
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, l-la, la, la, la, l-la, la, laa  
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, l-la, la, la, la, l-la, la, laa  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah..
