Baby's got a brand new hairdo, but doesn't she look so nice?  
She said everything that she cares to, she's saying it not once but twice  
She said it doesn't matter unless I say it matters  
Well, I don't care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it, and the girl I still have  
She's the girl that used to have it and the girl I still have  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so fine?  
She said everything that she used to  
Except she's picking your heart, not mine  
She said "it doesn't matter unless I say it matters"  
[?]  
I don't care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it, and girl I still have  
She's the girl that used to have it, and the girl I still have  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so good?  
She looks like Billy Boy Arnold, said I wish you would  
I wish you would  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, I wonder what's left inside  
She used to [?] at med school, before she learned how to be snide  
She walks in the place and everybody scatters  
I don't care about all the modern girls  
She's the girl that I used to have and the girl I still have  
She the, she the...
