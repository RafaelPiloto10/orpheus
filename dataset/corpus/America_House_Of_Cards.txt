There was a time I walked the earth  
As if I knew my way  
It seems the more I got around  
The less I had to say  
  
I built a world of tumbling dice  
Upon a field of sand  
And now the more I try to give  
The more that you demand  
So we wait, then discard, house of cards  
  
I took a pane of broken glass  
And made a diamond ring  
For every single blade of grass  
Mm, of thee I sing  
Why we wait, hesitate, I don't know  
  
Don't tell me 'bout your world coming apart  
Should have known about you girl, right from the start  
So we wait, to discard, house of cards  
  
I'm walking down a lonely road  
To the edge of town  
If you try and change my mind  
I won't turn around  
Tell me why I should try once again  
House of cards
