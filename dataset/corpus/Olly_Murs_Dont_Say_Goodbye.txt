There's a word that would hurt  
I can feel on your lips  
Like a gun to my heart  
When all that I want is a kiss  
  
But we fell so hard and it felt so right  
So don't let it all end here tonight  
And we could fall all over again  
  
Don't say goodbye  
Keep us alive  
'Cause my world will stop if we didn't try  
Can't we pretend just for tonight  
'Cause those words would tear the stars from the sky  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
  
There's a word that would hurt  
And you can't take it back  
So just show me more than words could ever say  
  
But we fell so hard and it felt so right  
So don't let it all end here tonight  
And we could fall all over again  
  
Don't say goodbye  
Keep us alive  
'Cause my world would stop if we didn't try  
Can't we pretend just for tonight  
'Cause those words would tear the stars from the sky  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
  
But we fell so hard and it felt so right  
So don't let it all end here tonight  
And we could fall all over again  
  
Don't say goodbye  
Keep us alive  
'Cause my world would stop if we didn't try  
Can't we pretend just for tonight  
'Cause those words would tear the stars from the sky  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it  
Don't don't don't say it
