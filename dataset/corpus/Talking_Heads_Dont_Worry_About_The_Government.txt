I see the clouds that move across the sky  
I see the wind that moves the clouds away  
It moves the clouds over by the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods  
I see the pine cones that fall by the highway  
That's the highway that goes to the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
It's over there, it's over there  
My building has every convenience  
It's gonna make life easy for me  
It's gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax alone with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building,  
Take the highway, park and come up and see me  
I'll be working, working but if you come visit  
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important  
  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
I wouldn't worry about me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
  
I see the states, across this big nation  
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.  
I think of the ones I consider my favorites  
I think of the people that are working for me  
  
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones  
They work so hard and they try to be strong  
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building  
They own the buildings to help them along  
  
It's over there, it's over there  
My building has every convenience  
It's gonna make life easy for me  
It's gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax along with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building  
Take the highway, park and come up and see me  
I'll be working, working but if you come visit  
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important  
  
I wouldn't worry 'bout  
I wouldn't worry about me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't you worry 'bout me...
