Four o'clock in the morning  
My mind's filled with a thousand thoughts of you  
How you left without warning  
But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through  
  
Now I see it so clearly  
We're together but living separate lives  
So, I wanna tell you I'm sorry  
Baby, I can't find the words  
But, if I could  
Then you know I would, yeah,  
  
No, I won't let go,  
Know what we can be  
I wont watch my life crashing down on me  
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah,  
Girl I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind  
  
You carried me like a river  
How far we've come still surprises me  
  
Now, I look in the mirror (look in the mirror)  
Staring back as the man I used to be with you  
How I longed for you  
  
No, I won't let go  
Know what we can be  
I wont watch my life crashing down on me  
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah  
Girl I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind  
  
Girl I'm sorry I was wrong  
  
Could've been there, should have been so strong  
  
So, I'm sorry  
  
Oh ohh wooohhhh ohhhhh  
  
No, I won't let go  
Know what we can be  
I wont watch my life crashing down on me  
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah  
Girl I'm sorry now (ooh, I'm sorry) we're the last thing on my mind (on my
mind)  
  
I won't watch my life crashing down on me  
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah  
Girl I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind  
(On my mind) (on my mind)
