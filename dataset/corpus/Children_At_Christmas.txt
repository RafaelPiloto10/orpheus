How busy Santa's elves must be,  
Making toys for you and me,  
Dolls and drums and other things!  
Oh, what joy our Christmas brings!  
  
At Christmas, Santa packs his sleigh,  
Then sets out upon his way,  
Taking presents 'round the world,  
For good little boys and girls.  
  
On Christmas morn, when I arise,  
I cannot believe my eyes!  
Santa must have heard my prayer --  
There's a puppy on the stair!
