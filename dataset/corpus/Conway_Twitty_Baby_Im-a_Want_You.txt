Baby, I'm a-want you  
Baby, I'm a-need you.  
  
You're the only one  
I care enough to hurt about.  
Lately I'm a crazy but I just can't live  
Without your lovin' and affection.  
  
Givin' me direction like a guiding light  
To help me through my darkest hours.  
Lately I'm a-prayin' that you'll  
Always be a stayin' beside me.  
  
Used to be my life was  
Just emotions passing by.  
Feeling all the while  
But never really knowing why.
