All I want is you, don't you know that  
Forever loving you, don't you know that it's true  
I'm leaving you tonight but don't listen if they say  
That we'll never meet again in the land of make believe  
We cannot lose the race, breaking the secret spells  
They put on us, my love  
We're far out of their reach, a million years ahead  
They never understand the mysteries of love  
Here's the mysteries of love  
Give your body to the mysteries  
Tear down your uniforms  
Here's the mysteries of love  
All I want to be, don't you know it  
All we wanna be is free like the birds of the sea  
We kiss the last good byes and are sailing with a smile  
'cross the iron borderline that butterflies despise  
We cannot lose at all  
Breaking the secret spells they put on us, my love  
Forever out of reach, a million dreams ahead  
They'll never understand  
The mysteries of love
