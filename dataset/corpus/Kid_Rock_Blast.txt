Aww shit!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kid Rock back in this motherfucking house  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
Mothers crying from these shotgun blasts  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
People dying from these shotgun blasts  
  
'Cause I'm rippin', flippin', crippin', like a real one does  
So if your rap's wrapped in jack, sweep it under the rug  
'Cause I'ma go above that, beyond the calls of my fuckin' duty  
'Cause all these corney, phony emcee's now a days don't move me  
So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves  
I got a full time pay, start to dig graves  
Because I'm buryin' emcee's, and sharin' their ladies  
Now you rolled hoes are carrying my babies  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
A broken home always hurts someone  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
I saw kids get shot, don't sell guns  
  
And still I rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does  
Rockin', shockin' on the stage, with a hell a steady buzz  
From a 5th of ol' Jimmy Beam  
We fryin' emcees up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean  
Sausage pattys, and smoking cabbies like it's no thing  
Drinkin' more Colt's then the 45 king  
Swingin' emcees like a cow hands rope  
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, I'm straight slittin' throats  
  
'Cause that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
Every time I get my gamble on  
Yeah that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
I never stay in one spot, i was born to roam  
Feel like I got bank, but it's not enough friend  
'Cause I want more bank see, than my grandkids could ever spend  
So if ya need some cheap slut, then speak up  
Most hoe's know not to ask for cash, 'cause I'm a cheap fuck  
  
[Chorus]
