He came from somewhere back in her long ago  
The sentimental fool don't see  
Trying hard to recreate  
What had yet to be created once in her life  
  
She musters a smile  
For his nostalgic tale  
Never coming near what he wanted to say  
Only to realize  
It never really was  
  
[Chorus]  
She had a place in his life  
He never made her think twice  
As he rises to her apology  
Anybody else would surely know  
He's watching her go  
  
But what a fool believes he sees  
No wise man has the power to reason away  
What seems to be  
Is always better than nothing  
And nothing at all keeps sending him  
  
Somewhere back in her long ago  
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life  
Someday, somewhere, she will return  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But what a fool believes he sees  
No wise man has the power to reason away  
What seems to be  
Is always better than nothing  
There's nothing at all  
But what a fool believes he sees
