I have been here many times before  
In a life I used to live  
But I have never seen these streets so fresh  
Washed with morning rain  
  
I have seen this face a thousand times  
Every morning of my life  
But I never saw these eyes so clear  
Free of doubt and pain  
  
Like the whole world has been made again  
  
I have been here many times before  
In a life I used to live  
  
And it's all because you made me see  
What is false and what is true  
Like the inside and the outside of me  
Is being made again by you  
  
And it's all because you made me see  
What is false and what is true  
Like the inside and the outside of me  
Has been made again by you  
  
Like a bright new morning  
Like a bright new day  
I woke up from a deep sleep  
I woke up from a bad dream  
  
To a brand new morning  
To a brand new day  
Like the whole world has been made again
