Got an AK-47, well you know it makes me feel alright  
Got an Uzi by my pillow, helps me sleep a little better at night  
There's no feeling any greater  
Than to shoot first and ask questions later  
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
Well, you can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right  
Yeah, I gotta be ready if the Commies attack us tonight  
I'll blow their brains out with my Smith and Wesson  
That ought to teach them all a darn good lesson  
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away  
  
Oh, I accidentally shot daddy last night in the den  
I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again  
Now why'd you have to get so mad?  
It was just a lousy flesh wound, Dad  
You know, I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
Oh, I still haven't figured out the safety on my rifle yet  
Little Fluffy took a round, better take him to the vet  
I filled that kitty cat so full of lead  
We'll have to use him for a pencil instead  
Well, I'm so trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away  
  
Come on and grab your ammo  
What have you got to lose?  
We'll all get liquored up  
And shoot at anything that moves  
  
Got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a laser sight  
Oh, I'm prayin' somebody tries to break in here tonight  
I always keep a Magnum in my trunk  
You better ask yourself, do you feel lucky, punk?  
Because I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away
