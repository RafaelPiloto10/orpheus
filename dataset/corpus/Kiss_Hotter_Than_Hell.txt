Come on  
She looked good  
She looked hotter than hell  
All dressed in satins and lace  
I looked at her and it was just too clear  
I had to get on the case  
I said Lady, oh lady, can I take you home  
There's just so much we could do  
I'll take you all around the whole wide world  
Before the evening is through  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
You know she's gonna leave you well done  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
Burn you like the midday sun  
I asked her why she couldn't make up her mind  
She said You don't understand  
I'd love to go, but there's something you should know  
She showed me her wedding band  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
You know she's gonna leave you well done  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
She'll burn you like the midday sun  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
You know she's gonna leave you well done  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
She'll burn you like the midday sun
