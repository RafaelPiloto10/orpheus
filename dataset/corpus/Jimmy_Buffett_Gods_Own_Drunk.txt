Well, like to explain to you all before,  
I ain't no drinkin' man  
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular  
And I swore I'd never do it again  
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still  
  
While he went in to town to vote  
It was right up on the mountain  
Where the map said it would be  
Friends let me tell you one thing,  
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still  
It stood up on that mountainside  
Like a hugh golden opal  
  
God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens  
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man  
But temptation got the best of me  
And I took a slash  
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat  
Like honey dew vine water  
And I took another slash,  
Took another'n an another'n an another'n  
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit  
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes  
  
Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body  
And a feelin' came over me  
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before  
It was like, like I was in love  
  
In love for the first time, with anything that moved  
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter  
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off  
In my brain sayin' "Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'"  
'Cause I was drunk  
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'  
Commode huggin' drunk  
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man  
  
And that's when I first saw the bear  
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall  
He rambled up over the hill  
Expectin' me to do one of two things,  
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one  
It hung him up  
  
He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear  
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause  
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man  
It hung him up  
  
He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes  
Was a lot redder than his was  
It hung him up  
  
So I approached him, I said "Mr. Bear, I love  
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body  
I know you got a lot of friends over there  
On the other side of the hill  
  
There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear  
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear,  
Pokey the bear  
  
I want you to go back over there tonight  
And tell them I'm feelin' right  
You tell them I love each and everyone of them  
Like a brother and a sister  
  
But if they give me any trouble tonight  
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill"  
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think  
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious  
Well hell I approached him again  
  
I said "Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord  
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it  
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear"  
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw  
And I led him over to the still  
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause  
He's smellin' somethin' good  
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water  
He downed it up right  
  
Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus  
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight  
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n  
For I knew it he downed eight of them  
And commenced to doin' the bear dance  
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt  
It was so simple like the jitter bug  
It plum evaded me  
  
We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar  
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside  
And I laid down and went to sleep  
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams  
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon  
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off  
In the heavens  
  
My buddy the bear was a missin'  
Want to know something else friends and neighbors  
So was that still
