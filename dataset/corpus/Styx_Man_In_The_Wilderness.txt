Another year has passed me by  
Still I look a myself and cry  
What kind of man have I become?  
All of the years I've spent in search of myself  
And I'm still in the dark  
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely soldier off to war  
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
Ten Thousand people look my way  
But they can't see the way that I feel  
Nobody even cares to try  
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road  
And I'm still in the dark  
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely sailor lost at sea  
Drifting with the tide  
Never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
(I'm alive)  
Looking for love I'm a man with emotion  
(And my heart's on fire)  
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean  
I'm alive!
