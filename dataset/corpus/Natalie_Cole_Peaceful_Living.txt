Have you been to the very top of the highest hill  
Where the air is fresh and sweet and the sky is so clear  
Looking out on the country side and the view of the villages so far away  
There is nothing to feel, nothing to feel  
Come with me, won't you take my hand  
Let's explore this heaven right here on earth, peaceful living is here  
Me and you on this mountaintop with our love we will never stop  
'cause we both know peaceful living is right here  
And here we are in utopia where the sun never seems to go away  
And the moon is our friend, hmm  
Looking out on a starry night and the sky is like a sleigh for riding on  
But you don't need a pin, you don't need a pin  
Precious one, you're a joy to me  
And I know that there's no place else I'd rather be  
Peaceful living is here, yeah, yeah  
Me and you on this mountain top with our love we'll never stop  
And we both know peaceful living is right right, hoo--  
And the moon is our friend, me and you, yeah, yeah, yeah--  
Precious one you're a joy to me  
And I know that there's no place else I'd rather be  
Peaceful is living here, oh, me and you on this mountaintop  
With our love we'll never stop 'cause we both know peaceful living is here  
We both know peaceful living is here  
We both know peaceful living is right here  
La, la, peaceful living, la, la, peaceful living, living, living--  
La, la, peaceful living
