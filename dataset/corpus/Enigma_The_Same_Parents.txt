[Chorus]  
We all had the same parents  
Many million years ago  
Why can't we live in freedom  
Without hunger, with no war?  
  
At the beginning we all had  
One mother and one father  
That's where we're descending from (attention)  
I don't, I don't understand why so much hate (attention)  
  
Between races, and religions  
It's mad, insane  
I don't understand (amazing)  
Why it has to be like that? (incredible experience)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Attention) I don't, I don't understand  
Why so much hate (amazing)  
Between races and religions (incredible experience)
