I was lost then I was found your love has turned my  
life around  
You gave me hope when hope was running low  
I was dead now I'm alive your faith allowed me to  
survive  
You touched my life when I was touch and go  
I tripped the light fell into a trance  
I tendered the song in my soul for dime and a dance  
A line of tears a stash of shame  
A fool lost in a losing game this whole life through  
'Til there was you  
  
I was lost then I was found your love has turned my  
life around  
You gave me hope when hope was running low  
I was dead now I'm alive your faith allowed me to  
survive  
  
I lost my heart my head my watch and my will  
Enchanted by lawyers in love and a little white pill  
A king a clown a falling star  
For rich for poor still there you are God only knows  
I love you so  
  
I was lost then I was found your love has turned my  
life around  
You gave me hope when hope was running low  
I was dead now I'm alive your faith allowed me to  
survive  
  
A king a clown a falling star  
For rich for poor still there you are  
A rush a ride a rock a rave  
A dead man walking on the waves  
A life the only love could save  
  
I was lost then I was found your love has turned my  
life around  
You gave me hope when hope was running low  
I was dead now I'm alive your faith allowed me to  
survive
