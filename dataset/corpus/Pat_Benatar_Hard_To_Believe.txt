Yesterday's a by-line, words upon a page  
Tomorrow is a deadline, sudden and it's strange  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Nowhere to go, can't sit still  
Look for a motive in the time that I kill  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty days, to fill up my empty days  
  
Hard To Believe  
you'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Love is such a fine line, the finest line I've known  
But sorrow is no life line when you're all alone  
  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Can't sleep a wink, up all night  
The truth hurts, you know it cuts like a knife  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty life, to fill up my empty life  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe
