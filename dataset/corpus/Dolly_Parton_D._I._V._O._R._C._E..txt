Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand  
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R-P-R-I-C-E  
But the words we're hiding from him now  
Tear the heart right out of me  
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today  
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E  
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas  
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak  
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek  
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today  
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E
