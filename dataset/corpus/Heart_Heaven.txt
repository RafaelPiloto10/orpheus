[Chorus]  
Baby, you're all that I want  
When you're lying here in my arms  
I'm finding it hard to believe  
We're in heaven  
  
Oh, thinking about all our younger years  
There was only you and me  
We were young and wild and free  
Now nothing can take you away from me  
  
We've been down that road before  
But that's over now  
You keep me coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And love is all that I need  
And I found it there in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven  
  
Now nothing could change what you mean to me  
There's a lot that I could say  
But just hold me now  
'Cause our love will light the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And love is all that I need  
And I found it there in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven  
  
Now our dreams are coming true  
Through the good times and the bad  
I'll be standing there by you  
We're in heaven  
  
And love is all that I need  
And I found it there in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven
