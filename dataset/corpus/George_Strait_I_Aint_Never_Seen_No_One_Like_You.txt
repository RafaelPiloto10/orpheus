I've traveled through lots of places  
Seen lots of folks and lots of faces  
Even settled down a time or two  
I've worked the farms, I've been to town  
Guess you could say I've been around  
But I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I knew a girl in Mississippi  
Had twenty different ways to kiss me  
Never found a thing she couldn't do  
Hey I even knew some twins in Denver  
Stayed with them one cold December  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
East to west north to south  
You're the very best girl there ain't no doubt  
I'm tellin' you you're really somethin'  
The way you got my heart a jumpin'  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
Hey girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
But I ain't never seen no one like you  
Ah yeah
