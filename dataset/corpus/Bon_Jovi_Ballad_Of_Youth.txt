Growing up today  
Theres many mountains you must climb  
Youre not the only one  
Cause everybodys on that line  
Hey mister know it all  
What do you recommend  
You think you know the answers  
But the questions never end  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Born outta passion  
To a world gone cold  
Ya wear it on your shoulders  
Its a heavy, heavy load I know  
Love and its emotions  
Come knocking at your door  
Young hearts will be broken  
And times the only cure  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Temptation makes us fall from grace  
But the angels were sinners  
And the sinners saints  
Forgive yourself cause were all the same  
Everybody rides on the karma train  
  
Young hearts  
Better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
Look in your mirror  
Itll tell you the truth  
Don't waste your time away  
Don't waste your life away, no, no  
Live today  
Theres no time to lose  
Cause when tomorrow comes  
Its all just yesterdays news  
  
All just yesterday news
