Listen to the wind  
Hear the voice inside you.  
Something in the air,  
Something you've been blind to.  
People everywhere are dying to be free.  
Time has come to live our lives in harmony.  
Chorus:  
Give the children of the world one more day,  
Give the children of the world, give them one more day.  
Where do we begin?  
When will freedom find us?  
Bring the new day in  
Free the chains that bind us.  
People reaching out for just a little more.  
Love is all we need to open up the door.  
Chorus  
Now the future's up to you.  
Take a stand and see things through  
For the children of tomorrow.  
Give the world one more day,  
Time enough to find a way  
To start over a way to go on.  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of the world  
One more day  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of tomorrow  
One more day
