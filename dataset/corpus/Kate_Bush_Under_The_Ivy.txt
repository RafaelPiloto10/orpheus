It wouldn't take me long  
To tell you how to find it  
To tell you where we'll meet  
This little girl inside me  
Is retreating to her favourite place  
Go into the garden, go under the ivy  
Under the leaves, away from the party  
Go right to the rose  
Go right to the white rose  
I sit here in the thunder  
The green on the gray  
I feel it all around me  
And it's not easy for me  
To give away a secret  
It's not safe  
To go into the garden, go under the ivy  
Under the leaves, away from the party  
Go right to the rose  
Go right to the white rose  
Go into the garden, go under the ivy  
Go under the leaves with me  
Go right to the rose  
Go right to the white rose  
I'll be waiting for you  
It wouldn't take me long  
To tell you how to find it
