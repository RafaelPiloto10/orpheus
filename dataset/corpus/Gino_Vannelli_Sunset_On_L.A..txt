Blow east wind blow  
Blow as you may  
Wish I had the power  
To take your breath away  
This life is golden  
But it's only deep as the skin  
Feelin' much colder  
Though I'm standin' in the warm desert wind  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
I'll miss you blue sky  
But not so much  
Too much of a good thing  
Keeps this old soul out of touch  
Sometimes you're empty  
Though your dreams they all seem fulfilled  
You're cool on the outside  
Though the real you is slowly being killed  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
Left a girl lyin' 'neath an old willow tree  
At times I think she'll still be waitin' there for me  
Gotta leave this town  
But it's always one day away  
Just saw one more sunset on l.a.  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Don't want to see  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Baby wait for me
