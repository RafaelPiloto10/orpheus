[Verse:]  
No more tears  
And no more fears  
Ever since I met the Holy One  
Yes He is so sweet  
And He comforts me  
I'm gonna take Him wherever I go  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's a sweet, sweet spirit  
In this place  
And I'm going to take that spirit  
With me every day  
(Repeat)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There's been a change  
A change in me  
I've got a new attitude  
A whole different personality  
And it's you, Spirit  
And I want the world to know  
I'm not at all acting funny  
Because of You I have a spiritual glow  
  
Chorus  
  
[Bridge:]  
There's something about Your spirit  
There's something about Your spirit  
There's something about Your spirit  
There's something about Your spirit  
  
(Vamp - Leads ad-lib)  
I'm going to take it (x8)  
  
I'm going to take it  
I'm going to take it  
I'm going to take it  
I'm going to -- Every day!  
(Repeat to end)
