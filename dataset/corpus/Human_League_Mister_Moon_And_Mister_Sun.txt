Time goes so fast today.  
Don't blink she'll go away.  
Don't close your eyes.  
Not for one moment. you feel so good right  
Now. you have to stay somehow.  
Don't let it slip. let time  
Stay frozen.  
She needs you.  
You need her.  
Just like the sun.  
Don't think  
That it's over.  
It's just begun.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our song has only just  
Begun. oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let these  
Minutes go too soon.  
If wishes were for free.  
My only hope would be.  
To stop the clock.  
Let's keep this moment.  
I guess that's just a dream.  
As hollow as your own moon beam.  
So let us revel in our time.  
She needs you. you need her.  
Just like the sun.  
It never is over.  
Once it's begun.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our life has only just  
Begun. oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let this  
Moment go too soon.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our life has only just begun.  
Oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let this moment go too soon.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our song has only just begun.  
Oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let these minutes go too soon.
