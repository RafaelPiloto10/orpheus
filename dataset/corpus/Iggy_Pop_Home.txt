I work so hard, so don't trip me up  
Shakin' a leg like the tail o' the pup  
I'm payin' dues till I register heat  
Sure hope I don't end up on the street  
  
Home, boy  
Home, boy  
Everybody needs a home  
Home, boy  
Home, boy  
Everybody needs a home  
  
So many people rise and fall  
Who's lookin' after you at all?  
Nobody knows anybody at all  
Strangers in paradise down at the mall  
  
Home, boy  
Home, boy  
Everybody needs a home  
Home, boy  
Home, boy  
Everybody needs a home  
  
The life we live is tricky tricky  
I love my home, and my family  
Who's gonna love you when the  
Mountain gets steep?  
We're gonna make it-in a Jeep
