I've searched through each moment of each passing hour,  
But your memory grows stronger, I find.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.  
  
They tell me, in time, I'll find another,  
An' happiness, again, will be mine.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.  
  
Somethin' each moment reminds me of you:  
You always end up on my mind.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.
