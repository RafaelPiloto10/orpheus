Thoughts of rain at sunset  
Clouds of rainbow blue  
Thoughts of sun on sand-dunes  
Where the seabirds flew  
This was our season and we said, it couldn't end  
But my love left with the rain  
Thoughts of leaves in autumn  
Falling from the trees  
Thoughts of hovering tree tops  
Leading to the sea  
This was our season, no lies and no pretend  
But my love left with the rain  
Thoughts of springtime rainfall  
Touching flowers that bend  
Thoughts of wind in willows  
Days that never end  
This was our season and we said it couldn't end  
But my love left with the rain  
Rain's the way you move now  
Sun the way you seem  
Flowers the, leaves the way you wonder  
Flowers the way you dream  
This was our season but sorrow waited 'round the bend  
For my love left with the rain  
This was our season and we said it couldn't end  
But my love left with the rain
