What good is melody, what good is music  
If it ain't possessin' something sweet?  
Nah, it ain't the melody and it ain't the music  
There's something else that makes this tune complete  
  
Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing  
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing  
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot  
Just give that rhythm everything you got  
  
Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing  
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing  
I said, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing  
Nah, it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot  
Just give that rhythm everything you got  
Don't mean a thing, boy, if it ain't that a swing
