Nothings last forever  
Of that I'm sure  
Now you've made an offer  
I'll take some more  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Will I still survive  
The same old scene?  
In our lighter moments  
precious few  
  
It's all that heavy weather  
We're going through  
When I turn the corner  
I can't believe  
  
It's still the same old movie  
That's haunting me  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Trying to revive  
The same old scene  
Young loving may be  
So extreme  
  
Maybe we should try  
The same old scene [Repeats]  
Nothings last forever  
Of that I'm sure  
Now you've made an offer  
I'll take some more
