Easy driver, she's a wicked rider  
She's smooth and she's skinny and she's probably mean  
Easy driver, pull up beside her, roll down the window on this fine machine  
Chorus:  
(Ooh ooh ooh) don't turn away, (ooh ooh ooh) just give me a sign  
(Ooh ooh ooh) don't be afraid, (ooh ooh) love is so hard to find  
Easy driver, get on up beside her, she don't drive like she knows the way  
Easy driver, road's getting wider  
There's room to run and she might skate away  
Come on back, baby what you say  
chorus  
One lane away from love, the story of my life  
Could I be good enough for your lonely avenue tonight  
It's a lonely avenue tonight  
chorus  
Easy driver, she's a wicked rider  
She's smooth and she's skinny and she's probably mean  
Easy driver, get on up beside her, roll down the window on this fine machine  
Easy driver, oh oh oh oh, easy driver, easy driver, easy driver (easy driver)  
Easy driver, easy driver, easy driver, easy driver
