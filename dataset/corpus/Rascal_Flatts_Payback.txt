Front of the line, straight past the bouncer  
Lookin' so fine that the band announced ya'  
Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right  
All your girlfriends say we throwin' down tonight  
Let me guess, somebody done you wrong  
And you're lookin' for a way to get your feel-good on  
Get some pictures on the Instagram and show him what he's missin'  
Straight no chaser, girl on a mission  
  
Mmm, baby, I could be your payback  
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back  
Take ya' to the dance floor I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Yeah, I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Gonna have a real good time  
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine  
We can show him what he can't have  
If you wanna play that game  
Yeah, baby, I can be your payback  
  
I bet he's sitting at home all alone in the dark  
Probably texting like mad, wants to know where you are  
'Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it  
Should have known runnin' around was gonna cost him  
No way that girl is as pretty as you  
I never even seen her but I know that it's true  
If he was even half a man he wouldn't have blown it  
Thinkin' 'bout it that way feels good, don't it?  
  
Mmm, baby, I could be your payback  
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back  
Take ya' to the dance floor I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Yeah, I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Gonna have a real good time  
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine  
We can show him what he can't have  
If you wanna play that game  
Yeah, baby, I can be your payback
