You're not worth it babe,  
The trouble you bring the noise you keep  
And you don't even care, yeah.  
  
I'm so sick of you babe,  
Nights wasted I'm through faking.  
You don't turn me on,  
You don't do anything at all.  
  
Baby I can't stand the sight of your face.  
Baby I don't even want to hear your name.  
  
Don't know what I saw  
But I ain't seeing it now.  
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth.  
  
Guess I fell too fast,  
Guess I learned my lesson.  
So much for true love,  
I'll take this chivas instead, oh yeah.  
  
You're too high maintenance babe,  
All the time you spent trying to fit in and no one even cares, yeah.  
It's so rediculous babe,  
Watching you turn as I burn.  
It's like you're not even there, yeah.  
  
Baby don't you try and hold my hand.  
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend.  
  
Don't know what I saw  
But are you seeing it now.  
Woke up this morning, biterness in my mouth.  
Guess I fell too fast,  
Guess I learned my lesson.  
So much for true love  
I'll take this chivas instead, oh.  
  
I'll take this chivas instead  
Of your bed.  
It wasn't even good.  
Trust me.  
I must have been so so so so lonely.  
You are crap, yeah.  
You should keep your eyes on your new little brat. Yeah.  
It's hard not to look I know  
I'm amazing  
I love you... Chivas.
