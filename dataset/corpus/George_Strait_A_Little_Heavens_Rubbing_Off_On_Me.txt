I used to like making love and then gettin' up and never havin' to explain  
I've always been free I never could see me dragin' no ball and chain  
I like running around and being tied down never was my cup of tea  
But since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me  
And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands  
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking bout future plans  
And then I get the feelin' that the life that I'd been leadin'  
Ain't all it's cracked up to be  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me  
  
I used like to spend the night sittin' on an old barstool  
Drinking wine and killing time with all over those other fools  
But since you took my hand I think I understand it ain't the way it out to be  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me  
And I'm beginning to like  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me
