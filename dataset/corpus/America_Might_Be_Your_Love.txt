Sometimes when you're there all alone  
Someone will call you at home  
You don't want to but pick up the phone  
Might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Someone who you thought would belong  
Came passing, moved right along  
You don't know why but something went wrong  
Might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Someone to hold you, someone to hold  
Someone to hold you, someone to hold  
Some girl who you watched at her desk  
Came dancing on with her dress  
And she looked up and wouldn't you guess  
She might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
(Someone to hold you)  
Might be your love (Someone to hold)  
Might be your heart (Someone to hold you)  
Might be your love (Someone to hold)  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark ...
