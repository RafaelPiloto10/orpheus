By Guy Clark  
  
And I'd sing the red river valley  
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of living'  
Wondering, lord, has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends, me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
He's A drifter and A driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to  
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him  
To A place called the green frog cafe  
And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes  
Lying' about their lives while they played  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
And I looked up and he was pushing eighty  
And there was brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me he's one of the heroes of this country  
See why's he all dressed up like some old man  
Drinking' beer and playing' moon in forty-Two  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
The day before he dies I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamt us up A kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
"DON'T CRY, JACK, IT'S ONLY JESUS COMING"  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train
