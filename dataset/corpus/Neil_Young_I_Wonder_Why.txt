For the love of man  
Who could understand  
What goes on  
What is right  
And what is wrong  
Why the angels cry  
And the heaven's sigh  
When a child is born to live  
But not like you and I.  
  
Let the angels ring the bells  
In the holy hall  
May they hear the voice  
That calls to them  
For the love of man  
Who will understand  
It's alright  
I know it's alright.  
  
Down the dusty road  
To the forest church  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why  
On the ocean wave  
In the billowing sky  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why.  
  
Let the angels ring the bells  
In the holy hall  
Let them hear  
The voice that calls.  
For the love of man  
Who will understand  
It's alright  
But I wonder why.  
  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.
