Is there nothing I can say, nothing I can do to change your mind?  
I'm so in love with you, you're too deep in, you can't get out  
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you  
  
Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?  
Just like the night, they dissolve off in sleep  
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah, the other night, cryin', cryin' baby yeah I'm cryin  
Yeah I'm cryin, I'm your child baby, child,  
Yeah I'm a child, I'm a child, I'm a child  
  
You think you're one of a special breed  
You think that you're his pet Pekinese  
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
Ooh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Yeah, I was dreamin' last night baby  
Last night I was dreamin' that you'd be mine  
But I was cryin' like a child  
Yeah I was cryin', cryin' like a child  
Could be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine all mine  
You could be mine, could be mine, could be mine all mine  
  
I come to you, so silent in the night  
So stealthy, so animal quiet  
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Yeah, you should be mine, mine, ooh!  
  
Mmm yes, you could be mine, tonight and every night  
I will be your knight in shining armor  
Coming to your emotional rescue  
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine  
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine  
  
I will be your knight in shining armor  
Riding across the desert on a fine Arab charger
