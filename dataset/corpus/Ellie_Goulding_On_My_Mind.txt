[Intro]  
Oh, oh  
Uh-oh-oh-oh  
Eh  
  
[Verse 1]  
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started  
I don't even really know what you intended  
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you  
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you  
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always hear, always hear them talking  
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with money  
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it  
You didn't love me, no, not really  
Wait  
I could have really liked you  
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you  
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good  
So I poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind  
  
[Bridge]  
You got yourself in a dangerous zone  
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And I still don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And my heart don't understand it  
Understand it, understand it  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
  
[Outro]  
Uh, uh, uh, uh
