You've got a great car  
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?  
I used to have one too  
Maybe you'll come and have a look  
I really like your hairdo, yea  
I'm glad you like mine too  
I see we're looking pretty cool, get chya  
So what do you do?  
Oh, yea I waiting tables too?  
No I haven't heard your band  
Because you guys are pretty new  
But if you dig, on vegan food  
Come over to my work  
I'll have them cook you something that you'll really love  
Cuz I like you  
Yeah I like you  
And I feeling some Bohemian like you  
(Yea I like you, and I feel some bohemian like you  
Woo hoo oooh)  
  
Wait.  
  
Who's that guy, just hangin at your pad?  
He's looking kinda sad  
Oh, you broke up?  
That's too bad  
But I guess it's fair  
If he always pays the rent  
And he doesn't get all bent  
About sleeping on the couch when I'm there  
Cuz I like you

And I'm feeling so bohemian  
I feel so bohemian like you  
And I want you

Cuz I like you I like you I like you  
Whoo-hoo-ooo
