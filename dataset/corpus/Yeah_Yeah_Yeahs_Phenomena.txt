Hey!  
  
Don't touch kid, sleep with the lights on  
Touch kid, how you surprise me  
Now roll kid, rock your body off!  
  
You're something like a phenomena  
Something like an astronoma  
Now roll kid, rock your body off!  
  
Something like a phenomena, baby  
You're something like a phenomena  
Something like a phenomena, baby  
You're gonna get your body off  
  
Don't fall asleep with the moonlight  
She'll make you sweat in the water  
Don't fall asleep with the moonlight  
She'll make you sweat in the water  
  
Hot time kid  
Hot time kid  
It's cold under the blanket

Then shot it  
The fastest ran and got it  
That story that ease my  
They hide it up the sleeves, my  
They hide it  
They hide it  
They're never gonna find it

She'll make you sweat in the water  
Don't fall asleep with the moonlight  
She'll make you sweat in the water

Something like a phenomena, baby  
You're gonna get your body off  
Something like a phenomena, baby
