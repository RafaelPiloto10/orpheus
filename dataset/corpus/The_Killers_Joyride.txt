It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra  
Stranded on the freeway burning with desire  
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light  
We talked about the real things  
And drove into the fire  
Headlights on the highway  
The desert wind is howling  
Rattlesnakes and romance  
Is filling with the rain  
Candy apple red dress  
Bleeding when she kissed me  
Heaven in a rag top  
Take away my pain  
  
[Chorus]  
When your chips are down  
When your highs are low  
Joyride  
Move across the night  
Like a separate wind  
  
Pulled up to a motel  
"Vacancy" was buzzing  
Pink and dirty neon  
Settle on the hood  
Wrap your arms around me  
Come a little closer  
Stumble in the twilight  
And fell onto the floor  
Loving Mona Lisa  
Dreaming of the free world  
Lipstick on the nightstand  
And demons at the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When your hopes and dreams  
Lose the will to go  
Joyride  
Reaching for the light  
Knowing we can't win  
  
There's something in the distance  
A glorious existence  
A simple celebration  
A place you've never been before  
Tell me that you wanna go  
  
Reaching for the light  
Knowing we can't win  
  
When your chips are down  
When your highs are low  
Joyride  
  
All your hopes and dreams  
All you need to know  
Joyride
