I've dreamed of you  
Always feeling you  
Were there  
And all my life  
I have searched for you  
Everywhere  
I caught your smile  
In the morning sun  
I heard your whisper  
On the breeze of night  
I prayed one day  
That your arms would hold me tight  
And just when I  
Thought love had passed me by  
We met  
That first look  
In your eyes  
I can't forget  
You melted me  
With your tender touch  
I felt all fear and sorrow  
Slip away  
Now here we stand  
Hand in hand  
This blessed day  
I promise you  
As I give to you  
My heart  
That nothing in this world  
Shall keep us apart  
Come happily ever after be  
The man I'll love  
Until the very end  
I've dreamed of you  
My great love  
And my best friend  
For god must know  
How I love you so  
He's blessed us here today  
As man and wife  
Come dream with me  
As I've dreamed of you  
All my life  
Come dream with me  
As I've dreamed of you  
All my life
