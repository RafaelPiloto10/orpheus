Now it's the year of Jubilee  
It's time for us to stand  
And shout the victory  
We cry out  
Come and move in power  
All across this land  
In righteousness we stand  
  
Jesus  
King of my salvation let your kingdom come  
As we see this nation run  
  
Let the earth sing  
All creation praise Him  
You alone are great  
And You're greatly to be praise  
Every nation, every generation  
We will lift your name  
And live for you always
