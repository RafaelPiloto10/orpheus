Looks like she really did you in  
You're a broken hearted lover  
Just tryin' to recover  
You need to find a place to mend  
All your time ain't necessary  
But I don't want to be a temporary thing  
Gimme just half a chance  
  
When this woman loves a man  
She'll do anything she can  
To keep the fire alive in your soul  
And when all the chips are down  
I'm still gonna be the one around  
To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man  
  
Don't play it cool, no don't be shy  
Oh there's no need to worry  
No I'm not in a hurry  
So let your conscience be your guide boy  
Come here and let me show you  
Just how much I adore you  
Let me help you understand  
  
When this woman loves a man
