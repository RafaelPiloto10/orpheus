Every time I look at your face  
I get this feeling  
Every time I look in your eyes  
It starts healing  
Every time we walk side by side  
Yes I get this feeling  
Because it's love, yes it's love  
Oh it's love  
Chorus:  
And we climb a step  
Every day it's you and I  
We climb a step  
Every day and every night  
It's every time you look at my face  
You give me this feeling  
Every time you look in my eyes  
My heart starts to tumble  
Oh I think of you all the time  
It's you I believe in  
Because it's love, yes it's love  
Oh it's love  
Chorus 1x  
Every time I look at your face  
I get this feeling  
Because it's love, yes it's love  
And it's love  
Chorus 2x
