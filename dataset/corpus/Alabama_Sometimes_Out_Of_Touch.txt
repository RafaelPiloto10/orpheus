There were times I stood my ground  
When I knew you were right  
Turned around and walked away  
When I should've held you tight  
But you never closed the door  
You just turned out the light  
Gave me time to think it over  
A chance to make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes out of touch  
But never out of love  
Sometimes giving in  
But never giving up  
We've been worlds apart  
Yet always close enough  
Yeah we've been out of touch  
But never out of love  
  
No matter how we try  
There still may come a time  
When our minds are far apart  
But I know you and me  
Will always find a way  
To be together in our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah we've been out of touch  
But never out of love
