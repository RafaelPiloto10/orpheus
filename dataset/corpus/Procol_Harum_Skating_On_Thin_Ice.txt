You were the player  
And you played it cool  
I was the stranger  
And I played the fool  
You were the teacher  
And you were the best  
I was the seeker  
And I failed the test  
We were always skating on thin ice  
Shaking the wrong dice  
Swimming against the tide  
Playing on the wrong side  
Yes you were the player  
And you were so cool  
I was the greenhorn  
King of the fools  
Painting the picture  
To fit with the frame  
Changing the players  
To fit with the game  
You were the searcher  
Out for the sky  
I was the traveller  
Just passing by  
You were the taker  
And you gave the call  
I was the faker  
And I dropped the ball
