I'm a ramblin' pony  
Rollin' from town to town  
I'm a ramblin' pony  
Rollin' from town to town  
I'm a looking for a sweet woman, make my love come down  
If she a married woman  
She only nine years old  
If she a married woman, yeah  
Only nine years old  
I got a woman I'm loving, keep me fishin' all day long  
And I'm leaving this morning, won't be back no more  
Yeah, I'm leaving this morning, won't be back no more  
There ain't a rider in the city, keep me inside the door
