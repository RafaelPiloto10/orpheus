They're trying hard to put me in my place  
And that is why I gotta keep running  
The future's mine and its no disgrace  
'Cause in the end the past means nothing  
  
You tell me I'm free then you tie me down  
And from my chains I think it's a pity  
What did it cost you to wear my crown  
You don't like it so why don't you admit it  
  
D'you feel a little down today?  
Bet you ain't got much to say?  
You're gonna miss me when I'm not there  
And you know I don't care, you know I don't care  
  
As we beg and steal and borrow  
Life is hit and miss and this  
I Hope, I Think, I Know  
And if I ever hear the names you call  
  
If I stumble catch me when I fall  
'cause baby after all, you'll never forget my name
