I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter  
He's gonna give me food and water  
I'm gonna eat that and look for more  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no  
And they didn't teach me that in school  
It's something that I learnt on my own  
That power is measured by the pound or the fist  
It's as clear as this, hey  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter  
He's gonna give me food and water  
I'm gonna eat that and look for more  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no
