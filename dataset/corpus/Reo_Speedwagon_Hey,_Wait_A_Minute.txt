Hey, wait a minute something just ain't right hey, wait a minute  
Something's just not fair  
I was supposed to win the lottery  
I'm supposed to be a millionaire  
I'm supposed to be a worldwide tourist  
With lots of equity and life insurance  
Yes I'm supposed to be a gold card member  
Rubbin' elbows with the big time spenders  
I'm supposed to be a wealthy man  
But all I've got are blistered hands  
Hey, wait a minute!  
  
Hey, wait a minute  
There's got to be a better way  
I'm workin' twice as hard but gettin' no richer  
Than I was yesterday  
I'm supposed to drive a big mercedes  
Live in a mansion full of naked ladies  
I'm supposed to own my own casino  
Be a superstar like sammy, frank and dino  
Some day I'm gonna be a big success  
And tell my boss to kiss my ass  
  
Hey, wait a minute  
Something must be wrong  
I'm supposed to be dining on caviar  
And drinking dom perignon  
Yes I'm supposed to have open invitations  
To classy country clubs all across the nation  
Yes I'm supposed to have jewelry and diamonds  
And a fifty foot yacht I can sail around the islands  
I'm supposed to be so carefree  
But all I've got is misery  
Hey, wait a minute  
Something's just not right
