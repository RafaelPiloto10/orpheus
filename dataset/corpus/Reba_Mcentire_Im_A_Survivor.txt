I was born three months too early  
The doctor gave me thirty days  
But I must have had my mama's will  
And Gods amazing grace  
  
I guess I'll keep on livin'  
Even if this loves to die for  
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'  
You're walking out and I'm not trying  
To change your mind cause I was born to be  
  
[Chorus]  
The baby girl without a chance  
A victim of circumstance  
The one who ought a give up,but she's just  
Too hard headed!  
A single mom who works two jobs  
Who loves her kids and never stops  
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter  
I'm a survivor  
  
I don't believe in self pity  
It only brings you down  
May be the queen of broken hearts  
But I don't hide behind the crown  
When the deck is stacked against me  
  
I just play a different game  
My roots are planted in the past  
And though my life is changing fast  
Who I am is who I want to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A single mom who works two jobs  
Who loves her kids and never stops  
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter  
I'm a survivor  
  
But I must have had my mamas will  
And Gods amazing grace
