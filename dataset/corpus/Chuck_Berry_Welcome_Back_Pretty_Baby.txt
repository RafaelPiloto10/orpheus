Hello, pretty baby  
How did your vacation go ?  
You know I long to be with you  
Because I really missed you so  
You must have many things to tell me  
But only one I yearn to know  
Shall we dance, pretty baby  
And does your love for me remain ?  
It's been a long hot summer  
With no one to entertain  
Ah, it's really boss to hold your hand, baby  
Dance and talk with you again  
Bye, bye for now  
But I shall call you on the phone  
I want to tell you how boss it was  
To have been your chaperone  
And if you choose me for your steady  
Darling, you'll never walk alone
