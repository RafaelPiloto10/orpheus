Hear what glorious song of angels  
Is now ringing through the air  
Never valley, never mountain  
Heard an anthem half so fair.  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man.  
  
Messengers of God's free mercy  
Are now seen by human eye  
Shepherds hear the wondrous message  
"Glory be to God on high."  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man.  
  
Let us also sing the praises  
Of our God so full of love  
Who on Christmas sent a Savior  
Sent a Savior from above.  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man...
