Bubba is a friend, he's a beer drinkin' buddy of mine  
But lately somethin's happened that ain't hard to define  
Bubba's got himself a cousin and I'm gonna make her mine  
And she's brushin' both his teeth  
And she's makin' him biscuits and gravy I just know it  
And she's lovin him in that double wide late late at night  
  
Y'know, I wish that I had Bubba's girl  
I want Bubba's girl  
Why can't I find a cousin like that?  
Like bubbas girl  
I want I want Bubba's girl  
Why can't I find a cousin like that!  
  
Hey!
