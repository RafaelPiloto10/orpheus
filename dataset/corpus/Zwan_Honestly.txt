I believe  
I believe  
I believe  
I believe the love you talk about with me  
Is it true, do I care  
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside  
But it's you that you erase  
  
Cause there's no place that I could be without you  
It's too far to discard the life I once knew  
Honestly, all the weather storms are bringing  
Are just a picture of my dreams  
Cause when I think of you as mine  
And allow myself with time  
To lead into the life we want  
I feel loved, honestly  
I feel loved, this honestly  
  
I believe you mean the best that life can bring  
I believe in it all  
Honestly, you can try  
Your heart is just as long as mine  
Is it ours to let go  
  
Cause there's no place that I could be without you  
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew  
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough  
To cover up the pain in us  
Cause when I think of you as mine  
And allow myself with time  
To lead into the life we want  
I feel loved, honestly  
I'll make a joke so you must laugh  
I'll break your heart so you must ask  
Is this the way to get us back  
I don't know, honestly  
I don't know, this honestly  
  
There's no place that I could be without you  
Honestly  
  
There's no place that I could be without you  
There's no place that I could gleam without you  
There's no place that I could dream without you  
There's no place that I could be without you  
Honestly
