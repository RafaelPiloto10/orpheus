United (I get tired of speaking)  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
  
I live with my heartache, you bet that I do  
I'm sad and I'm shaken, I'm empty and so blue  
Magical function, I gave it all to you  
They say they'll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say they'll never let you down  
United we fall  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
What if you're alone at night?  
What if we're all heaven's children?  
  
I grew up in darkness, my enemies few  
I gave you my life, it was easy for you  
No explanation, this boy has grown up too  
They say they'll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say they'll never let you down  
United we fall  
I believe the world should always be our standing ground  
  
And I believe the world should hold us close  
And spin this great big world around  
Don't be scared at night alone  
And spin this great big world around  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
What if they break hearts for you?  
(And I will never let go)  
What if you're intent is true?  
(No matter how we control)  
What if you're just tired of crying?  
(I will never let go, no matter how we control)  
Heaven's children  
  
I was young, but still I knew  
People were just frightened too  
I would talk, they would not hear me  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
  
I have been a lonely boy  
I have been a broken man  
I am here and still I'm crying
