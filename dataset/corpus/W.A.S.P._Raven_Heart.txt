ANGEL OF ORLEANS in me  
I'll tell you no lies  
Ravens have bore me wings to fly  
King of the night time forever  
I'll embrace my immortal  
Forever night  
One crimson kiss is bleeding  
It's all I'm living for  
Bring me the nighttime forever  
Tales of the darkside here is all right  
Take me hand and I'll show ya  
My raven heart  
Raven - say you want me to  
It's all you're dying for  
Forever night  
Rain the dark on forever you  
Raven heart  
No there ain't nothing dark that I won't do  
My raven heart'll bleed all over you
