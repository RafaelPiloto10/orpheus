Someone states the obvious  
Someone sneers at all you love  
Someone preaches ugly manners  
excluding some, including me  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
All feelings blunted, all passion spent  
Everybody does what everybody does  
All the broken promises  
to recreate a status quo  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll
