[Verse 1: gucci mane]  
Do you know who I am? Baby girl my name the shit  
I'm the shit, yeah the shit, gucci mane off in this bitch  
When I spit stupid swift, I feel like I got a gift  
Leave the truck 'bout forty thousand, but this one is?  
I'mma roll to a blimp, ladies ask me do I pimp  
Cause I walk with a limp, so much ice you feel a chill  
Light a spliff, take a wiff, if you feel like take a sniff  
Drink a fifth, pop a?, one of those then plead the fifth  
40k on a wednesday, catch me in the m  
Look at me, look at them, don't I look better than him  
Girl, my rims match my jewels, pinky same color my wheels  
And my drop top match my ears, no flaugin' I keep it real

Engine bigger than a mo'fucker, but on the dashboard you see fish  
See-through, all blue, I'm bigger than a barracuda, fuck you  
Whole bunch of niggas in my clique, they the realest

Microphones I blaze, any little beat, any track I'll kill it  
Fuckin' a model straight playboy, I stick my ding-a-ling down they throat like

My woman fuck me good and make kush cookies  
Pockets on snookie, I wouldn't fuck snookie

Eat a red bone, like red velvet cake  
Fuck a nigga wife, and eat the wedding cake  
And if that nigga trippin', tell him yellow tape
