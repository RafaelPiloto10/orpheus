Oh, the people would come from far and away  
They'd dance all night 'till the break of day  
When the caller would holler "Do-si-do"  
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go  
  
Late in the evening about sun down  
High on the hill and above the town  
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord a how it'd ring  
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing  
  
Oh, he played an old piece he called 'Soldier's Joy'  
And he had one he called 'Boston Boy'  
The greatest of all was 'Ginny Lyn'  
To me that's where the fiddlin' begin  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, I'll never forget that mournful day  
When Uncle Pen was called away  
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow  
You knew it was time for him to go  
  
[Chorus:]
