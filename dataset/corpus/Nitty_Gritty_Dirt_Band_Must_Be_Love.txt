Never had trouble sleepin'  
Always had someone next to me  
Nights I won't remember  
I fooled around til the fool was me  
  
Never thought much about you  
On and off like a well worn shoe  
Now I worry where you're walkin'  
I guess the shoe's on another foot  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt, I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy, it must be love  
  
Lately I'm hearin' rumors  
You've been makin' serious plans  
Should I have held you when I had you  
Right here in the palm of my hand  
  
Chorus  
  
This much heartache, it must be love  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt, I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy  
A little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt and I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy, drives me crazy  
  
This much heartache, it must be love  
  
Must be love, it must be love  
Oh it must be love, must be love  
It must be love, must be love  
It must be love, oh it must be love  
Must be love, oh it must be love
