All the big fools in town got together  
Every hopeless lovin' heart I know was there  
We all sat around and told our own best story  
Then they made me the big fool of the year.  
  
Oh, they gave to me a little golden statue  
Of the torch that I carried for you, dear  
They said no one else could even come close to me  
And that I was the big fool of the year.  
  
I'll put mine up beside  
Any foolish love in town  
'Cause there's none can hold a light  
To this torch I carried round.  
  
I can't say I'm to proud of the honor  
But then I guess I do deserve it, dear  
For to love you after all you've made me suffer  
Surely makes me the big fool of the year.  
  
Yes, you've made me the big fool of the year
