Lunch, lunch will keep us together  
There's no meal that's better  
Just give me a fork and a spoon, it's almost noon  
Make me some food 'cause I wanna eat soon  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together  
  
Hot dogs, Mac and cheese  
French fries and ketchup I'll drown  
When the others say they're stuffed  
Who's still chowing it down?  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
Bite down and chew forever  
Lunch will keep us together  
Ate it before and I'll eat it again  
Alone or with friends  
Keep the food coming and I'll tell you when  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together, whatever  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together, tastes good  
  
Hot dogs, Mac and cheese  
French fries and ketchup I'll drown  
When the others say they're stuffed  
Who's still chowing it down?  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
Bite down and chew forever  
Lunch will keep us together  
Ate it before and I'll eat it again  
Alone or with friends  
Keep the food coming and I'll tell you when  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Now stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together, whatever  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
Tastes good, yummy, yummy  
I can't stop, I can't stop  
(Lunch a-coming, keep it on)  
Alright, everything
