I have never known a love like this,  
Before in my life,  
Tears can turn into bliss,  
With only a kiss, only a kiss.  
  
And I have never held a girl,  
Like you so close in my arms,  
You appeared in my world,  
And offered me hope for one more time.  
  
I've never been so afraid,  
That love is just a dream,  
Darling I'll awake and you'll be gone,  
Never believe that I'll love somebody,  
I'll love somebody, someone like you,  
I'll love somebody, I could love somebody.  
  
You're too early for the sun,  
Too early for the moon,  
Too early for the rain,  
Coming down on me,  
You make me feel so close to home,  
So far away, like nowhere else I've never been.  
  
You're too early for the stars,  
Too early for the wind,  
Too early for my heart,  
To open up again,  
  
But when I see you I just laugh,  
And I believe, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.  
  
I have never known a life like this,  
Except in my dreams,  
One kiss and I was renewed,  
Now I'm alive, I have survived.  
  
I have never loved a girl,  
Like you, except in my dreams,  
All my songs are for you,  
I finally see my dreams come true.  
  
I've never been so afraid,  
That love is just a dream,  
Darling I'll awake and you'll be gone,  
Never believe that I'll love somebody,  
I'll love somebody, someone like you,  
I'll love somebody, I could love somebody.  
  
You're too early for the sun,  
Too early for the moon,  
Too early for the rain,  
Coming down on you,  
You make me feel so close to home,  
So far away, like nowhere else I've never been.  
  
You're just too early for the stars,  
Too early for the wind,  
Too early for my heart,  
To open up again.  
  
But when I see you I just laugh,  
And I believe, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.  
  
Ooh, Darling, welcome to the wind,  
As we sail our ship of dreams into uncharted waters,  
Forget about the stars, and love will lead you higher,  
So girl, let's ride the wind.  
  
Surrender to the sun,  
Surrender to the moon,  
Surrender to the rain,  
Surrender to the stars,  
Surrender to your heart,  
Surrender to the wind.  
Take a chance,  
Open up, let me love again.  
  
Surrender to the sun,  
Surrender to the moon,  
Surrender to the rain,  
Surrender to the stars,  
Surrender to your fears,  
Surrender to your tears,  
Take a chance,  
Open up, let me love again.
