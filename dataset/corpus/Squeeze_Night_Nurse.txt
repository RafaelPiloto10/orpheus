Tell her try her best just to make it quick  
Woman tend to the sick  
Because there must be something she can do  
This heart is broken in two  
Tell her it's a case of emergency  
There's a patient by the name of Mickey  
  
Night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
My night nurse oh god  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
  
I don't want to see no doc  
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock  
Because there's no prescription for me  
She's the one the only remedy  
  
My night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
  
My night nurse  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
I'm hurt my love  
  
I don't want to see no doc  
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock  
Because there 's no prescription for me  
She's the one the only remedy  
  
Night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
  
My night nurse  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
I'm hurt my love  
And I'm sure no no doctor got a cure  
  
My night nurse  
My night nurse  
My night nurse
