I found out what I've been missing  
Always on the run  
I've been looking for someone  
  
Now you're here like you've been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me, baby  
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me,  
Never too much  
Baby, you give good love  
  
Never stopping I was always searching  
For that perfect love  
The kind that girls like me dream of  
  
Now you're here like you've been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me, baby  
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me,  
Never too much  
Baby, you give good love  
  
Now I've stopped looking around  
Each night, what this life's all about  
Our love is here to stay, to stay  
Baby, you give good love  
  
So good  
Take this heart of mine  
Into your hands  
You give good love to me  
Never too much  
No, no, no, no, no  
You give good love to me  
So good, so good  
  
You give me good love  
Good love, good love  
Yeah you do  
You know what I need
