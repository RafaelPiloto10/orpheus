Shattered, but I'm not broken  
Wounded, but time will heal  
Heavy the load, the cross I bear  
Lonely the road I trod, I dare  
Shaken, but here I stand  
Weary, Still I press on  
Long are the nights, the tears I cry  
Dark are the days, no sun in the sky, yes  
  
Yet still I rise  
Never to give up  
Never to give in against all odds  
Yet still I rise  
High above the clouds  
At times I feel low  
Yet still I rise  
  
Sometimes I'm troubled, but not in despair  
Struggling, I make my way through  
Trials, they come to make me strong  
I must endure, I must hold on  
  
Yet still I rise  
Never to give up  
Never to give in against all odds  
Yet still I rise  
High above the clouds  
At times I feel low  
Yet still I rise  
Above all my problems  
Above all my eyes can see  
Knowing God is able to strengthen me  
To strengthen me  
  
Yet still I rise  
Never to give up  
Oh, Never to give in against all odds  
Yet still I rise  
High above the clouds  
At times I feel low  
Yet still I  
I need to know which way to go  
Yet still I  
At times I feel low  
Yet still I  
Oh Oh Oh I rise  
Yet still I rise  
Oh yes I do, yeah yeah
