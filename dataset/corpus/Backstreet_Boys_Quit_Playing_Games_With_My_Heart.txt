Baby, oh  
  
Even in my heart I see  
You're not bein' true to me  
Deep within my soul I feel  
Nothing's like it used to be  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Before you tear us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
I should've known from the start  
You know you got to stop (from my heart)  
You're tearing us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
I live my life the way  
To keep you comin' back to me  
Everything I do is for you  
So what is it that you can't see  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
You better quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong  
Don't leave me hangin' here forever  
Oh baby, baby this is not right, let's stop this tonight  
  
Baby, (oh) quit playin' games  
Baby  
  
Sometimes I wish I could  
Turn back time, impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Baby  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
(my heart)  
Baby (my heart)  
  
With my heart
