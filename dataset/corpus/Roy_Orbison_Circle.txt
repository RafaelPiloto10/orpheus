Try to keep from thinking, thinking means remembering  
Remembering means hurtin' hurtin' ain't so funny  
Funny how it hits you, hits you out of nowhere  
Nowhere to hide from it, it will last forever  
  
Forever is a long time, time keeps on a-creeping  
Creeping toward tomorrow, tomorrow starts it over  
Over all the lovin', lovin' and the good times  
Good times turn to bad times, bad times start me thinking  
  
Thinking is remembering, remembering starts the circle  
Circle in a circle, circle rounding circle  
Circle is unbroken, unbroken is the circle  
Never ending circle, circle without ending  
  
Thinking in a circle, circle empty circle  
Circle without ending....
