I know some lovers would be satisfied  
With sweet, 'I love yous' and some pretty lines  
But that won't get you in this heart of mine  
No, you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words, sweet words that you say  
It is all in the things that you do, I'm telling you  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof from you  
(Oh, baby)  
And if the love you got is strong and true  
And if you love me like you say, you do  
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth  
And your kiss could never tell a lie  
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes  
There is one way to ease any doubt, I tell you now  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, I won't be impressed unless I get some tenderness  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof, oh, oh, from you, oh, oh  
(I need lovin' proof)  
If the love is right  
(I need lovin' proof)  
Prove it, prove it all night  
(I need lovin' proof)  
From you  
'Cause you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words, sweet words that you say  
It is all in the things you do, I'm telling you, telling you, baby  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and tell me something from the heart  
I need lovin' proof, give me lovin' proof, oh, oh, from you  
(Lovin' proof)  
If you want me to believe, I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, lovin' proof  
(I need lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me, show me  
(And tell me something from the heart)  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
If you want me to believe I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, lovin' proof  
(Ooh, baby, baby)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Ooh, ooh, give me, give me, give me)  
If you want me to believe I'm the only one you need
