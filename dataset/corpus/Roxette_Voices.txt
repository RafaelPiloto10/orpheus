I knew this would happen  
And I don't want to be around  
When it gets out.  
I've closed the last picture  
  
And painted the windows  
Inside and out.  
Give me your dreams  
And I'll give you my time,  
  
Together we'll cross the borderline.  
Voices -  
Cracking the night,  
Voices -  
  
That cut like a knife,  
Voices -  
Hear them singing...  
From sparks to the fire,  
  
From here to obsession they cover the end.  
Twisting a match  
And see the reflections of hunters of men.  
Give me your dreams  
  
And I'll give you my time,  
Until we make it to the borderline.  
Voices...
