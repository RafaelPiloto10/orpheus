From nowhere through the caravan  
Round the campfire light  
Lovely woman in motion  
With hair as dark as night  
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark  
That hypnotized me with love  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She danced around and round  
  
Guitar's melody  
From the fire her face was aglow  
How she enchanted me  
I'd like to hold her near  
And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
  
All through the caravan  
She was dancing with all the men  
Waiting for the rising sun  
Everyone was having fun  
Hated to see her go  
Knowing that she'll never know  
That I love her  
That I love her  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman
