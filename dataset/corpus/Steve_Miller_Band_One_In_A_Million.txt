Oh, I'd like to be like a bird up in the sky  
Hoppin' from branch to branch and learning to fly  
I'd fly right over the hill  
Right to your window sill, your window sill  
I'm just crazy about you darlin'  
You're one in a million  
Or I'd like to be like a fish down deep in the sea  
Swimmin' from canyon to canyon and feeling free  
I'd pull up on your line  
Let you catch me any time, any time  
I'm just crazy about you darlin'  
You're one in a million  
Or I'd like to be like a great big bumble bee  
I'd live in a hive that was hangin' from your tree  
I'd make sweet honey for you  
That's just what I would do, only for you  
I'm just crazy about you darlin'  
You, you, you  
You're one in a million
