Now I'm levitating  
Cause I feel like I've been waiting  
For a lifetime  
For your touch  
  
Now I'm six feet off the ground  
And I may never come back down, yeah  
Cause I still feel your kiss  
It's on my lips  
And I keep wishing  
You come back around, oh  
  
When you came along  
(When you came along)  
You know you save me from  
(You know you save me from)  
Ordinary day  
(Yeah!)  
  
You left me with your touch  
So thank you very much!  
  
Oh yeah!  
Thank you very much!  
  
I want to thank you for this smile  
Although I don't say this much  
It's usually not my style  
I was sleeping and yesterday  
You gave my world a shakin'  
My eyes are open wide, oh  
  
Can't believe it's true  
(I can't believe it's true)  
I've been kissing you  
(Cos I've been kissing you)  
Now everything I do  
(Everything I'm)  
I'm sucker to your touch  
So thank you very much!  
  
I want to say  
  
Thank you very much!  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
(Imagine my surprise!)  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
(Cos I can't say goodbye)  
Some day  
I may fall  
But till that day  
I'll be feeling high  
So high  
Yeah, yeah  
Thank you very much!  
I want to thank you  
For the love that you gave me  
Cause it's all in your touch  
  
Can't believe it's true  
(I don't believe it's true)  
I've been kissing you  
(Cos I've been kissing you)  
Now everything I do  
(Well everything I'm)  
I'm sucker to your touch  
So thank you very much  
  
One more time!  
Thank you very much!  
I got a feeling, girl  
You can be my world  
We were meant to be together  
Can't you see it got me, oh yeah!  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye
