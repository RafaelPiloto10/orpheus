You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Never let her go  
  
You think you lost her number but you've only lost a little bit of time  
She's waiting just to see you boy, a continental girl so fine  
Mirrors on the ceiling make it hard for you to sleep at night  
The opportunity is now  
You know you got to do what's right  
  
So, you take yourself down to her  
Before it gets too late  
There's no need to telephone  
Cause this can hardly wait  
The meaning of a moment has never been so strong  
A girl like this, a night like this  
It's right where you belong  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don"t you go)  
  
She found you in a restaurant when you were with another girl  
Remember?  
You tried to tell her how it was just to live in a harmless world  
Remember how she looked at you  
Remember how she stole your eyes  
And now you're all alone at night  
Runnin' out of alibis  
  
So, you take yourself down to her  
Before it gets too late  
There's no need to telephone  
Cause this can hardly wait  
The meaning of a moment has never been so strong  
A girl like this, a night like this  
It's right where you belong  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don't you go)  
  
You've got to take your time  
Take your time  
Take your time whenever you see her  
Save her every moment you can  
  
With your every wonderful feeling  
Let her know that you will be her man  
Open arms are never too open  
Lovin' hearts are never too free  
  
Let the circle never be broken  
Let it be what you want it to be  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don't you go)  
  
Hold her now  
Hold her now  
Never let her go
