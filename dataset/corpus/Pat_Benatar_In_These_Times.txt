What's the use in staying  
When everything's a lie  
I hear what you're saying  
And it makes me want to cry  
  
You know the truth is so overrated  
That should come as no surprise  
It's all so complicated  
Especially in these times  
  
Don't it make you crazy  
Don't it make you ask yourself why  
Nobody's got an answer  
Especially in these times  
  
Life is like a puzzle  
Best to chose the edges first  
And work back to the middle  
To the places where it hurts  
  
Lately I've been thinkin'  
Maybe there's a chance for us  
If we take it slow now  
And don't expect too much  
  
Don't it make you wonder  
Don't it make you ask yourself why  
Nobody's got an answer  
Especially in these times  
And don't it make you crazy  
Don't it make you ask yourself why  
Nobody's got an answer  
Especially in these times  
  
Ooh, ooh  
(What's the use in stayin', when everything's a lie  
And there's nothing sacred, especially in these times)  
  
Hey don't it make you crazy  
Don't it make you ask yourself why  
Nobody's got an answer  
Especially in these times  
And don't it make you wonder  
Don't it make you ask yourself why  
Nobody's got an answer  
Especially in these times  
In these times
