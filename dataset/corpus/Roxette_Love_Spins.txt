Hold back the night  
I wonder what she's doing when she's not in sight  
I wonder where she's going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if she's sleeping alone  
  
And hold back the pain  
I cover up the teardrops in the pouring rain  
My heart has been run over by a runaway train  
I wonder if she's ever alone  
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!  
  
Her love spins like a merry-go-round  
Going up and down, she's far away bound  
Her love - expression of vision and sound  
It's setting me up, and then it's kicking me down  
  
Don't fade to gray,  
I wonder if she's ever coming back to stay  
She's running on the edge she hit the harder way  
I wonder if she's only a dream  
  
So hold back the night,  
I wonder what she's doing when she's not in sight  
I wonder where she's going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if she's lost in a dream  
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!  
  
Her love spins...
