Lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
That I'm down on my knees  
Lord, have mercy on me, please  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Jesus, I must confess  
That in all my loneliness  
I've forsaken, and I've sinned  
Leaving fragments of a man so broken  
  
I could tell you what I've done  
Or should I tell you where I went wrong?  
  
Well, the more that I start to play  
My deceitful, evil ways  
Keep on growing stronger by the day  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked a sinful road  
So I'm gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord, have mercy on me, please  
  
Mother Mary full of grace  
In my weakness, I've lost faith  
I've been careless, and I have been warned  
And the devil inside me is torn  
God bless the men that I have scorned  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
So I'm gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord have mercy on me, please  
  
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah  
Whoa, yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
Oh-oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh  
  
So don't let me fool around no more  
Send your angels down to guide me through that door  
Well, I've gone and confessed my regrets  
And I pray I'm not held in contempt  
I'm so lost, and I need you to help me repent  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
Oh, I'm begging, I'm pleading, I'm needing  
I want you to know  
So I'm down upon my knees  
Oh lord, I need forgiveness  
I need forgiveness from you
