Baby, here I am again  
Kicking dust in the canyon wind  
Waiting for that sun to go down  
Made it up Mulholland Drive  
Hell bent on getting high  
High above the lights of town  
  
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
  
Thirty days and thirty nights  
Been putting up a real good fight  
And there were times I thought you'd win  
It's so easy to forget  
The bitter taste the morning left  
Swore I wouldn't go back there again  
  
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
  
When it comes to you  
Oh, the damage I could do  
It's always your favorite sins, that do you in  
  
You and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
Never enough, you and tequila, you and tequila make me crazy
