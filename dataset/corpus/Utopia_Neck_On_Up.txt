I gave the girls the eye  
I've given lust a try  
I'm just an average guy  
From the neck on down  
I used to have my fun  
When all was said and done  
I only wanted someone  
From the neck on down  
Maybe it's one too many mornings after  
Maybe I'm sick of my own nervous laughter  
  
Now I'm looking for heaven  
From the neck on up  
For a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up  
  
I was a typical man  
I had a master plan  
I thought that heaven began  
From the waist on down  
And I had always said  
That I could use my head  
But I was thinking instead  
From the waist on down  
Maybe it's one too many frozen shoulders or  
Maybe I haven't noticed getting older  
  
Trapped in a dream  
Something has to change in this endless stream  
Of ships that pass in the night  
Is this what I want out of life?  
I want to know what this game is about  
I want someone to try and figure me out  
  
I can't determine why  
But I'm a different guy  
Your modus operandi  
Turned me inside out  
It's not that I don't care  
About your fine hardware  
But you've got something else there  
I can't figure out  
Maybe I just can't finish what I've started or  
Maybe it's simply that I've been outsmarted  
  
Now I've found my heaven  
From the neck on up  
You're a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up
