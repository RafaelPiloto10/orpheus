I think this intro should be more dramatic  
Ah man  
It's LL season, let's ride  
  
Hands up, hands up  
Hands up, slip into the bath salt  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Uh, boss of all bosses  
Face in the car, make a young girl noxious  
Yea, this beat salad when I toss this  
Never go against me, you lack resources  
What? I skywalk with the forces  
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches  
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses  
Maserati coup, take galloping horses  
Nah, there's never been one like me  
They're looking for a new me as if there might be  
Even with a love song, that's unlikely  
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me  
Uh, killin' Queens all day  
I got what you want, what you willin' to pay?  
Your boy ladies love sound, clean on the track  
Slip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Honestly I was scared to come back  
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react  
Said my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap  
But now I teach class, put back Tony  
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass  
Giving all for my soul to have another smash  
Yea, LL Cool J  
30 years later, be me for a day  
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway  
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray  
Cats on my team, got NBA  
But it's my black, from the web we stay  
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age  
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised  
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains  
But the money's coming in in 360 ways  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
They's are kinda salty over there
