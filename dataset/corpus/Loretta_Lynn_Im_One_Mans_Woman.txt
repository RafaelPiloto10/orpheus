You know that I love you my love made me your fool  
The way down deep inside I know you never will be true  
But I'll keep holdin' on for life just as long as I can  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
But I can't let that change me into something I can't stand  
I give you all the love I have but your love is out of hand  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
[ piano ]  
Sometimes I have a notion to get revenge but then  
Since I'm in love who cares about the place I've never been  
When temptation smiled at me back to your arms I ran  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
I'm one man's woman...
