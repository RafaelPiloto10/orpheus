I sold my soul for the second time, 'cause the man don't pay me.  
I begged my landlord for some more time, he said "Son, the bill's waiting."  
My best friend called me the other night, he said, "Man, are you crazy?"  
My girlfriend told me to get a life, she said, "Boy, you lazy."  
  
But I don't mind, as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine.  
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.  
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.  
  
[Solo]  
  
I don't mind, as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine.  
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.  
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.  
  
I lost my faith in the summertime, 'cause it don't stop raining.  
The sky all day is black as night, but I know I can't blame me.  
I begged my Doctor for one more line, he said "Son, words fail me!"  
There ain't no place to be killing time, I guess I'm just lazy.  
  
I don't mind, as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine.  
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.  
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.
