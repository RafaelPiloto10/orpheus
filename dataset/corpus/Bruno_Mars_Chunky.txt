[Verse 1]  
She got to shake her little something  
(Shake her little something)  
Throwing that thing from left, right, side to side  
She got to have her own money  
(She got her own money)  
Shout out to the girls that pay they rent on time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If you ain't here to party take your ass back home  
If you getting naughty, baby here's my phone  
Slide with your boy to the bar  
Slide with your boy to the car  
I've been searching everywhere and now here you are  
[Chorus]  
Chunky  
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops  
That drop it down in daisy dukes  
(I wanna get down)  
Yeah, I am the one, I'm trying to recruit  
I'm looking at you  
Yeah, you baby  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now let me hear you say you ready (I'm ready)  
Girl, you better have you hair, weave strapped on tight  
Girl once we can go, where we rolling  
We'll cha-cha 'til the morning  
So just say alright (alright)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If you ain't here to party take your ass back home  
If you getting naughty, baby here's my phone  
Slide with your boy to the bar  
Slide with your boy to the car  
I've been searching everywhere and now here you are  
  
[Chorus]  
Chunky  
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops  
That drop it down in daisy dukes  
(I wanna get down)  
Yeah, I am the one, I'm trying to recruit  
I'm looking at you  
Yeah, you baby  
  
[Bridge]  
You got what I want (I got what you want)  
You got what I need (I got what you need)  
Girl you 7-27-42  
Squeeze all of that into my coop  
Girl, I choose you  
  
[Chorus]  
Chunky  
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops  
That drop it down in daisy dukes  
(I wanna get down)  
Yeah, I am the one, I'm trying to recruit  
I'm looking at you  
Yeah, you baby
