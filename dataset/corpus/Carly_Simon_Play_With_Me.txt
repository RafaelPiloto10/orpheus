Play  
You can play with me  
But take it easy  
Have  
You can have your fun  
But only with me  
  
I've had  
Some big time winners  
Played games  
You'd never imagine  
I'd know  
But now I'm ready  
To quit those sinners  
I've turned myself  
Into the ground  
And now  
I feel so slow  
  
Put a smile on my face  
But don't bloodshot  
My eyes  
The love  
That you give to me  
Has enough surprise  
  
Baby  
You know what I was  
You've seen me  
At parties before  
And don't cha know  
That all  
That running around  
Was wild and gay  
But in the end  
Just a bore  
  
So play  
You can play with me  
But take it easy  
I said take it easy  
Take is easy
