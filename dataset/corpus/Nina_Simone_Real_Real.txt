I say real real  
Our love is real to me  
It thrills me  
With perfect liberty  
When you tell me you love me  
And you hold me and kiss me  
Then I know it's real real  
It's so real to me  
  
I say real real  
Our love is real to me  
Please thrills me  
With your kisses sweet  
Tell your papa and your mama  
One day soon we're gonna  
Have a great weddin' day  
It's so real to me  
  
I say real real  
Out love is real to me  
It gives me perfect liberty  
When you tell me you love me  
And you hold me and kiss me  
Then I know it's real  
It's so real to me  
  
I say real now, real  
It's so real to me  
Please thrill me  
With your kisses sweet  
Tell your papa and your mama  
One day soon we're gonna  
Have a great weddin' day  
It's so real so me  
So real so real  
It's so real to me
