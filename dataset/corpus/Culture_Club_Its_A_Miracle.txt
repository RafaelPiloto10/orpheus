Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Who's in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
There's no one there to keep you warm  
It's no surprise there's something in my eyes  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Dance with the counterfeit  
The plastic smiles and micro heat  
I'll meet you there, I'll meet you there  
Run to the edge of town  
Where Hollywood lay its footprints down  
Monroe was there but do you really care  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
  
Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Who's in disguise, who's in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
There's no one there to keep you warm  
It's no surprise there's something in my eyes  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion
