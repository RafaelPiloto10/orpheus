I know you've been in love before  
I know it some times seems like war  
But I just want to show you there's no use  
To hold up those scars anymore  
  
Cause honey I'm gonna love you and  
I'm gonna take care of you  
And I'm gonna love you all our lives  
You will be needed  
All your words of wisdom headed  
And I'm gonna love you all our lives  
  
They say it's pretty in the snow  
Maybe we'll find out if its so  
We can take a photograph and write underneath  
The places we wanted to go
