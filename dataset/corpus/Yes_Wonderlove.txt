I believed that one day love would cast a line  
I believed there was something more for me to find  
Hoping today  
Hoping tomorrow  
Taking it all in stride  
I believed  
I could be chasing my mind  
  
There you were  
Like a dream to me  
Wonderlove  
Could this really be  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
I believe if only we could take the time  
Eventually we would learn each other's life  
Open your heart  
Give it a moment  
Leaving the cares behind  
Happily  
We could be two of a kind  
  
There you were  
Like a dream to me  
Wonderlove  
We were meant to be  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
It was the very next day that I came alive  
The door flung open  
There was a vision  
Couldn't believe my eyes  
Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it  
Everyone believing here at last receiving  
Wonderlove  
It's a place we all belong  
Wonderlove  
  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're my world  
  
I believe I could walk a thousand miles  
Just to see the vision of your simple smile  
Everyday  
Wanting to follow  
Forever by your side  
Faithfully  
You are my destiny  
  
There you were  
Wonderlove  
We were meant to be  
Wonderlove  
It's the world where we belong  
Wonderlove  
Together we will faithfully  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to  
If you're looking for the wisdom of the world  
All you've got to do is let it coming through  
Be forever  
  
Just imagine  
Wonderlove
