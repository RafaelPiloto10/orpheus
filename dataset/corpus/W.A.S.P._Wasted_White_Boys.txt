GIVE ME A LINE  
And pour me wine  
I'll do the Devil's daughter  
Fill my glass and kick your ass  
I'll do it any time  
Oh, I don't want no Holy rollers  
On you knees  
I don't need  
There's no time to waste tonight  
No don't hold me rollers  
Cause I might die tonight  
It's come down to blows  
I am - wasted and out of order  
With a bloody nose  
Oh I don't want no Holy rollers  
Demon swill with a thirst to kill  
I'll do it anytime  
There's no time to waste tonight  
On your knees  
No don't hold me rollers  
Howl at the moon in the night  
Cause I might die tonight  
I don't need  
Wasted boys feeling no pain  
I'm the devil alright  
Just give me shooters and that demon cocaine  
I'm a wasted white  
White boys better  
Run for you lives  
It's do or die, die  
I'll tell you why  
Rather die that get civilized  
Wasted white boys ride free and I'd  
Oh let me ride
