Well she's washed and polished  
And full of high octane  
Ridin' with the top down  
Crusin' in the fast land  
Her red hairs blowin' bright as a flame  
Cadillac red's her name  
  
Cadillac red  
Singin' as she passes by  
Cadillac red  
See that hillbilly fly  
Catch her if you can  
She can out run any man  
Cadillac red  
  
Her radio's loud and she's rollin' to the back beat  
Her best girlfriends are piled in the backseat  
She's puttin' her lipstick on  
Cause' there's a Mustang blowin' his horn  
  
Cadillac red  
Singin' as she passes by  
Cadillac red  
See that hillbilly fly  
Catch her if you can  
She can out run any man  
Cadillac red  
  
Hey, hey, Cadillac red  
Hey, hey, Cadillac red  
Hey, hey, Cadillac red  
Hey, hey, Cadillac red
