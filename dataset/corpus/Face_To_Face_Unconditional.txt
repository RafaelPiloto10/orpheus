Is there a way to become invisible?  
You say you might but you wouldn't dare  
I think it works when it's unintentional  
I know you hear me and I know that you don't care  
I'm not invisible  
  
I didn't say that you were unemotional  
You put it on like the clothes you wear  
You've got emotion but it's one-dimensional  
Your full of hate full of anger full of fear  
I'm not invisible  
  
No love is unconditional  
No way to walk that line  
You couldn't make it if you tried  
Is there a way to become invisible?  
I've done my best to be seen and heard  
I'm not amazing and I'm not original  
I'm not so sure did you even catch a word?  
I'm not invisible  
  
No love is unconditional  
No love is unconditional  
No love is unconditional  
No love is unconditional
