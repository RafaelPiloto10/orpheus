[Verse 1]  
Angel, oh oh oh oh  
Knew you were special from the moment I saw you, I saw you, yeah  
I said angel, oh oh oh oh  
I feel you're closer every time I call you, I call you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings  
But I know what I am and the life I live, yeah, the life I live  
And even though I sin, maybe we are born to live  
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this, yeah if we're meant for
this  
  
[Chorus]  
And if we're not, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love  
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said angel, woah oh oh oh  
You'll probably never take me back and I know this, yeah I know this, aw man  
I said angel, woah oh oh oh  
I'm so desensitized to feeling these emotions, yeah, no emotions baby  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings  
But I know what I am and the life I live, yeah, the life I live  
And even though I sin, we are born to live  
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this, yeah if we're meant for
this  
  
[Chorus]  
And if we're not, hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love  
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Bridge]  
And even though we live inside  
A dangerously empty life  
You always seem to bring the light  
You always seem to bring the light  
And even though we live inside  
A dangerously empty life  
You always seem to bring me light  
You always seem to bring me light  
  
[Chorus 2: The Weeknd and Maty Noyes]  
I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love  
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh  
I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love  
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh  
I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody  
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love  
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh  
  
[Outro: The Weeknd and Maty Noyes]  
Ooh somebody baby, I hope you find somebody

Somebody to love, somebody to love
