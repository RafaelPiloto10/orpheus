[Chorus]  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
Oh you come and you go,  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
Just like the morning sun.  
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me.  
  
Version girl, what's your name?  
Don't you know I long to say.  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Version girl, what's you name?  
Oh you come  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.  
  
[Chorus]
