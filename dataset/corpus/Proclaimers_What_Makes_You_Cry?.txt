Now I've got a question baby  
What makes you cry?  
'Cause I haven't seen any water  
In the corners of your eyes  
  
For a day, or a week  
Or a month, or a year  
Haven't seen much of you  
Since you left me my dear  
  
Can't you see that I'm hurting  
How I'm falling apart  
Don't you care about my drinking  
Or my poor lonely heart  
  
I thought you liked football  
You didn't mind those videos  
And my dog didn't mean  
To ruin your clothes (he can't help it)  
  
Now you won't take my phone calls  
You sent my letters back  
You're paying for a lawyer  
To stab me in the back  
  
Then I saw you on the street  
You looked happy, that's a fact  
I'm impressed - it's a hell of an act  
  
Angel - admit it, admit it  
Darlin' - admit it, admit it  
Your love for me didn't die  
It's just sleepin'  
  
Now I hope you can hear me  
Wherever you are  
In a cheap hotel room  
Or the back seat of a car  
  
I make up those situations  
I don't know if they're true  
But I'll tell you, for now, they'll do  
  
Angel - admit it, admit it  
Darlin' - admit it, admit it  
Your love for me didn't die  
It's just sleepin'  
And it wakes every night  
To your weeping'  
  
Now I've got a question baby  
What makes you cry?
