Filled your head with lead 'cause I want you dead  
Girlie girlie bitch, you fucking freaky bitch  
I knowing what you think, you think your shit don't stink  
Take you out to dine and dine and wine and dine  
  
I tell you you look fine, then we fuck till I break your spine  
Bitchy bitchy hoe, we fucking on the floor  
We fucking in the bed then I'll shoot you in your head  
You never make me cry, before that bitch you die  
  
Wicked clown sadistic Sadistic psycholistic  
I do like Nate the Mack and club ya in the back  
I'm not like other guys I'm quick to blacken your eyes  
Tommy son take off your coat I'll make you feel at home  
  
Then take out my billy club and go upside your dome  
Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe  
You have a can of mace I'll shoot you in your face  
I grab you by the neck and rip that shit out  
  
Don't think that I'd hit ya but I'd punch and stomp and kick ya  
You wouldn't hit a lad, what bitch, what hoe  
Bitch, you told me that you loved me I thought that shit was true  
But then you sucked on my boy's dick until his balls turned blue  
  
Freaky freaky trick, take your fucking pick, suck or fuck or what?  
Nasty nasty slut I guess love is the word, you act like you ain't heard  
I'm not like other guys I'm quick to blacken your eyes  
Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe  
  
I heard you gotta neck, why, uh, why don't you let me, uh  
Why don't you uh why don't you let me break it, bitch?  
I think I hurt a hoe a helpless drunken hoe  
Someone tell me so do I hear a hoe?  
  
Bitch, get in the car then I'll take you to the bar  
But I took her to the alley, and kicked her with the balley  
Stomped her in her face, her chicky chicky face  
You took my heart and bit it so I took your lip and split it  
  
You took my life and crushed it I took your head and bust it  
I take your leg and break it I take your life and take it  
And bitch it's no surprise I'm not like other guys  
Take it, take it, take it cut off your head and bake it  
  
And bitch it's no surprise I'm quick to blacken your eyes  
Tommy son take off your coat I'll make you feel at home  
Take that razor to your throat, I'm from the ghetto zone  
Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe
