Can't get to sleep tonight  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter how I try  
Gotta get you off of my mind  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
Spoke to you today  
Called you on the telephone  
You sounded very far away  
But baby I love you, I still love you, oh ah  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter what I do  
Just can't get you off of my mind  
You know I'm stuck on you, stuck like glue  
We both live separately  
Found somebody new  
And he's real, real good to me  
But baby, I love you, I still love you, yeah  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
Don't want to believe, that it's over  
I keep telling myself, one more time  
So I lie awake with a heartache, you're always on my mind  
Haunting my memory, think about you all the time, oh oh  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter how I try  
Just can't get you off of my mind  
Sleep tonight  
Spoke to you today  
Called you on the telephone  
You sounded very far away  
But I love you, I still love, yeah  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter what I do, what I do  
It all keep coming back to you  
Can't get you off of my mind, get to sleep tonight  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter how I try, what I do  
It all keep coming back to you  
Can't get you off of my mind  
You know I'm stuck like glue, stuck like glue  
I'm stuck like glue to you  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No matter how I try  
Gotta get you off of my mind  
Can't get to sleep tonight  
No, I can't get to sleep tonight  
Baby, can't get to sleep tonight  
Honey, can't get to sleep tonight
