One, two, three  
Yes, I've been waitin', but you just don't come around  
You've been droppin' in on everyone all over town  
Say what you like, but you just don't know your place  
And everywhere we go, people seem to know your face  
You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night  
Never knowing where you've been, you say, "It's alright"  
I placed all my faith in you, then you let me down  
Everything I said is true, but you don't hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame  
They said it was too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
They said I was too late, for your love  
They said I was too late, you're gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
Yes, every now and then, my mind turns things around  
And I believe it's true, that our love can still be found  
Just one thing I care about, from sea to shining sea  
And you know that's the love you give, the love you give to me  
You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night  
Never knowing where you've been, you say, "It's alright"  
I placed all my faith in you, then you let me down  
Everything I said is true, but you don't hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame  
They said it was too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
They said I've been too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends
