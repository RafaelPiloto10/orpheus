Jimmy's outside with his motor engine hummin'  
Sent me along to see if you were comin'  
Out onto the highway gonna break the city limits  
Jimmy's gettin ready gonna put his foot in it  
Soft shoe Louie drinkin with his floozy Sue  
Got the invitation the burn out's due  
I'd be a rebel when I'm good and ready  
Headin for the bar  
Tell Jimmy to cool it  
But not to go too far  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Louie and Jimmy didn't know about the plan  
Cops out on the highway  
Gonna take the job at hand  
Been hidin out for Louie gonna get him canned  
Gonna catch him in the action  
He's gonna wanna make a stand  
Jimmy's impatient wants to burn on rubber  
He's gotta wait for Louie  
Cause there ain't no other  
The undisputed king of the road said "Jimmy, I'm ready You better shift your
load"  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
C'mon and get it, boy  
Louie and Jimmy's out to have a fight  
Shakin hands with the man below  
Stokin' out the flames  
Flames burnin' higher  
One of them has gotta go  
One of them has gotta go  
Highway nine and they're starting to roll  
Jimmy's hearts thumpin  
Blood runnin cold  
Louie looks over and gives a sly smile  
Says look in your mirror boy  
Cops are behind  
Get a move on Jimmy  
You're fallin for the trap  
There's only one winner  
The loser takes the rap  
Well, Bye bye Jimmy,  
Don't wait for me inside  
I'm goin back to floozy Sue  
And thanks for the ride  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine
