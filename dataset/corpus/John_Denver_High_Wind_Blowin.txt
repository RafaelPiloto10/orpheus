There's such a high wind blowing  
It's snowing in my bed  
Oh baby, you started flowers growing  
Where nothing grew instead.  
I need some things to hide the failure  
Of my garden, and the way it grew  
Oh baby, I didn't know I could depend on you  
There's such a high wind blowing  
I won't get to sleep tonight  
I think that warm wind feels alright  
There's such a high wind blowing  
I won't get to sleep at all,  
I feel like I'm gonna fall  
Into your fine high wind.  
  
You look like twilight falling  
On the ocean in the setting sun  
Oh baby, do you know what you have done  
I feel like you have changed my mind  
About living the way I do  
Oh baby, I didn't know I could depend on you  
There's such a high wind blowing  
I won't get to sleep tonight  
I think that warm wind feels alright  
There's such a high wind blowing  
I won't get to sleep at all  
I feel like I'm gonna fall  
Into your fine high wind.
