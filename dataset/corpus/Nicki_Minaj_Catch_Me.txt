Extracurricular  
Parallel to none  
I am perpendicular  
Hit em with the "O" now that just ridiculous  
We coulda cleared up all these particulars  
That coulda been a homicide vehicular  
You wasn't in no state to speed off  
You was bugging out yeah you was peed off  
We was just chilling up at the ski loft  
Thinking we was on you tellin me we off  
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call  
That's the effect they call a snowball  
Next thing you know I was runnin down a hall sayin Please come back I have
given my all  
  
I have given my all  
Funny how you could always make me feel small  
I have given my all  
Catch me catch me  
I think I'm gonna fall  
My mind is made up  
I'm waiting for you  
I'm waiting on you, waiting boy  
My mind is set

You wanted oh so bad to prove points  
But your game always makes me lose points  
And your game always make me concur  
And maybe I shoulda never taken you from her  
But with all of the aforementioned  
I am still trapped in your dimension  
So I will be on the mountain waiting  
Cause I am in need of more attention  
Could have called back  
Just to say something  
Imma fall back  
In the bass drum  
Please come to destination  
I'm not doin well exclamation  
You succeeded at your attempts to make me  
Need you desperately to vindicate me  
It's funny how you could always make me feel small  
I have given my all  
Catch me catch me  
I think I'm gonna fall  
My mind is made up  
I'm waitin for you  
I'm waitin on you, waiting boy  
My mind is set
