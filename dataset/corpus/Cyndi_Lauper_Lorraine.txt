Long ago a lonely man stood  
Off of a quiet avenue  
A pretty girl in passing chanced to look  
That's when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain  
Pounding on the railing  
The beat's a sweet, soft refrain  
Of how he found you LORRAINE  
He's rocking on a porch you used to know  
Here where he swore his love was true  
He sips his drink and dreams the days of old  
Of when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain...
