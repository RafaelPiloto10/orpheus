This is the third of June, 1988  
A highly unimportant day  
Some airplane gliding into one of the bigger clouds over Manhattan  
In a downtown far away, Mr. Toomy, our face in a crowd  
The city was slow and tired  
The Wall Street boys wearing their ties around their neck  
Like boxer's towels after a fight  
Mr. Toomy stopped his pinstripe suit outside a barber shop  
Looked at his face, took off his jacket and stepped on it  
  
Who's that, what's that, what do you mean  
I'll never know where I lost my dream  
Who's that, what's that, gimme your name  
Third of June, end of game  
  
No looking to the right  
No looking to the left  
Lenny is a target and always on track  
Lenny is a target and nobody shoots  
Lenny is a target lost the route  
Ruins of a child's old fantasy  
Ruins of a child was [?]  
Lenny is a target and nobody shoots  
Lenny is a target lost the route  
  
Who's that, what's that, what do you mean  
I'll never know when I lost my dream  
Who's that, what's that, gimme your name  
Third of June, end of game  
  
Mr. Toomy stopped his pinstripe suit outside a barber shop  
Looked at his face  
Took off his jacket  
Put it on the pavement  
Stepped on it  
And started preaching like a monk from another world  
After some minutes, he had a little crowd  
Which disappeared when a police car passed by slowly  
Like rolling gloom  
And Mr. Toomy throws his voice 'til he was the only one in the area  
At this early night of June 3rd, 1988  
  
Who's that, what's that, what do you mean  
I'll never know when I lost my dream  
Who's that, what's that, gimme your name  
Third of June, end of game
