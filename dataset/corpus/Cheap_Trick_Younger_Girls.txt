Try to bend me, try to shake me  
Try and turn my head around  
Oh try to change me, rearrange me  
I think you know about the boy you found  
A fantasy like this is hit and run  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
I had a dream about girls like you  
You said call us, you'll get two  
One for your money, two for the show  
I'll give you something more  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
It's hard enough to make you want to cry  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
It's hard enough to make you want to cry  
And it drives me out of my mind  
I'm in love with you, baby  
My poor innocent baby  
Don't you say maybe  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
Feels so good, let me in  
I might jump right out of my skin  
Don't you ever grow up little girl  
Sweet young thing, not so innocent  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls
