Damn these old wheels  
Rolling too slow  
I stare down this white line  
With so far to go  
  
Headlights keep coming  
Loneliness humming along  
Who poured this rain  
Who made these clouds  
  
I stare through this windshield  
Thinking out loud  
Time keeps on crawling  
Love keeps on calling me home  
  
I'd jump all these mountains and take to the skies  
Sail through the heavens with stars in my eyes  
  
If my heart had wings  
I would fly to you and lie  
Beside you as you dream  
If my heart had wings  
  
We both committed  
We both agreed  
You do what you have to to get what you need  
Feeling you near me with so many miles in between  
Lord, it ain't easy out here in the dark  
To keep us together so far apart  
  
If my heart had wings  
I would fly to you and lie  
Beside you as you dream  
If my heart had wings  
  
Stuck on this circle  
Spinning around  
Cut loose from this rope  
That's tying me down  
  
If my heart had wings  
I would fly to you and lie  
Beside you as you dream  
If my heart had  
If my heart had wings  
I would fly to you and lie  
Beside you as you dream  
If my heart had wings
