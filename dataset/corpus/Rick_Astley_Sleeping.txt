I toss and turn, I'm turning around but I cannot sleep  
I'm hypnotized, I'm paralyzed by a different beat  
I hear your voice getting louder now, yet so out of reach  
But I'm mistaken, it's only the echo of you  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
And the night goes on and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on  
  
A crowded bar, the mating game so I'm out of place  
It's so bizarre, she coming onto me, but I see your face  
The DJ plays familiar songs and it takes me back  
But I'm mistaken, it's only the echo of you  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
And I need healing it's been so long  
And the night goes on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
  
I hear your voice, I hear your voice calling  
I hear your voice? on and on and on and on  
  
I toss and turn I'm turning around but I just can't sleep  
I'm hypnotized I'm paralyzed  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I need healing it's been so long  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I m not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I need healing it's been so long  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I m not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)
