Oh Maria, oh Maria, oh Maria, oh, ah  
Oh when she speaks, this Spanish words  
It's like a fire in my soul, and it hurts  
And when she moves, I cannot sleep  
I think I'm strong, but I know I'm so weak  
When she's next to me  
Oh it's like ecstasy  
  
Lonely Maria, Maria, Maria  
You're such a beautiful but lonely senorita  
Lonely Maria, Maria, Maria  
Oh do you have the time, to kiss me oh Maria  
Maria, Maria, I know  
Maria I miss you so  
Maria, Maria don't go  
Baby I need you so  
  
Oh when she danced, and when she smiles  
It's like an old old Spanish lullaby  
And when she talks, see now her dance  
It's like an old old Spanish love romance  
When she's next to me  
Oh it's like ecstasy
