We had a good thing going  
But it's all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
That is so hard to find  
  
We've been in love  
But you didn't really care  
I wanted you  
And your love to share  
  
I said baby  
Is it something I've done  
I said baby  
Is it something I've said  
Don't make me cry  
No no no no no  
  
We had a good thing going  
But it's all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
That is so hard to find  
  
I didn't know you  
Had a doubt in your mind  
With a kiss you  
Didn't show any sign  
You made a fool out of me  
And I was too blind  
I couldn't see  
It was over for me yeah  
  
We had a good thing going  
But it's all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
But it's all over now  
All over now  
All over now
