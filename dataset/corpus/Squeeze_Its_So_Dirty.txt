Well you'd better not tell I've had a good night  
Me and this bird she's a bit of alright  
Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched  
She is the business for a bit of old skirt  
It's so dirty when it's in the right mood  
Give it some brandy and some chinese food  
Take her for a spin with your stereo jack  
Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had  
Give it some gold to put round its neck  
Bet here old man puts you on the deck  
But its so dirty with me - it so dirty with me  
Its so dirty with me - its so dirty with me  
  
Well you'd better watch out here comes a tornado  
You'll end up looking like a mashed potato  
If her old man gets word of what's going on here  
You'll end up at the bottom of someone's next beer  
  
Well I've got a bud ain't frightened by shooters  
So lets have a drink for a couple of troopers  
No her old man won't know I've been giving it some  
Unless you tell him the news but we know that ain't done
