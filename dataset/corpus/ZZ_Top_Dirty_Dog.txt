Hey baby, watcha gonna do?  
Now that I've left you and I said we're through  
All along you been runnin' round  
But you ain't the only game in town  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog a scurvy dog  
  
Hey baby, when we got it on  
You made me feel like there ain't nothin' wrong  
Just don't bug me like you're so naive  
I'm crackin' up, I'm gonna take my leave  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog  
  
Hey baby well it's over now,  
I'll make my exit and I'll take a bow  
Your problem's cured with a dollar bill  
And if it won't I know a flea collar will  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog a scurvy dog.  
Arf! arf!  
  
Hey! Get that dog out of my yard!
