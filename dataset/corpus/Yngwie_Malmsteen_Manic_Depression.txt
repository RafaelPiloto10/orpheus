Manic depression's touching my soul  
I know what I want but I just don't know  
How to, huh, go about gettin' it  
Feeling sweet feeling,  
Drops from my fingers, fingers  
Manic depression's a catchin' my soul  
Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain  
You make love, you break love  
It's, a, all the same  
When it's, when it's over, baby  
Music, sweet music  
I wish I could caress, caress, caress  
Manic depression's a frustrating mess  
you'ow!  
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off,  
And, huh, go on down  
All the way down  
Really ain't no use in me hanging around  
In,a, your kinda scene  
Music, sweet music  
I wish I could caress, in a kiss, kiss  
Manic depression is a frustrating mess  
you'ow!  
Yeah  
Ow!  
Music sweet music, sweet music, sweet music, uh. . .  
Music sweet music, sweet music. . .yeah  
Ooooooo....  
Depression . . .
