You said  
I cannot get there from here, baby  
And I don't care where I'm goin'  
Here's to your thin red line  
I'm stepping over  
  
Thought you'd never miss me  
'Til I got a Fat City address  
Non-stop talker, what a rocker!  
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress  
  
Change, nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah you hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah you hit the ground running  
  
No, I don't ask for permission  
This is my chance to fly  
Maybe enough ain't enough for you  
But it's my turn to try  
  
Thought you'd never miss me  
'Til I got a Fat City address  
Non-stop talker, what a rocker!  
Blue-eyed murder in a side-swiped dress  
  
Change, nothing stays the same  
Unchained, and ya hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running  
  
Change, nothing stays the same  
Unchained, and ya hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running  
  
Take a look at this!  
Hey, man, that suit is you!  
You'll get some leg tonight for sure!  
Tell us how you do!  
(Come on, Dave, give me a break.)  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, one break coming up!  
  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change, and nothing stays the same  
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running
