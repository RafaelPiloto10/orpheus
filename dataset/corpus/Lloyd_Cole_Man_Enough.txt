Now that the low life has no meaning  
'Cause you've been there  
Now you're gone  
But your heart won't keep from cheating  
It's stringing you along  
Stranger to me  
Well, what's the lowdown?  
Are you man enough to pray  
For a better way of living?  
I believe I've lost my way  
Oh, May, could you please hold me?  
I believe I might fall  
I believe that I might fall  
Could there be a better way of living  
Better than the easy way?  
Could the wretched be forgiven?  
Are you man enough to pray?  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance I'd lost my way  
Would you help me find it, babe?  
Oh, May, could you please hold me?  
I believe that I might fall  
I believe I might fall  
Now that the low life has no meaning  
'Cause you've been there  
Now you're gone  
But your heart won't keep from cheating  
It's stringing you along  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance I'd lost my way  
Would you help me find it, babe?  
Oh, May, could you please hold me?  
I believe that I might fall  
I believe that I might fall  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance I'd lost my way  
Am I man enough to pray?  
Am I man enough to pray?  
Are you man enough to pray?  
Are you man enough to pray?
