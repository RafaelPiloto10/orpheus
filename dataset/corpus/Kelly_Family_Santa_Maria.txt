To the sky to the mountains  
To he river to the valley  
To my hometown to my country  
To the place were I was born  
To my mother to my father  
To my sisters and my brothers  
To my friends and myself  
And to those I love so well  
  
Santa Maria prega per noi  
Santa Maria prega per noi  
To the world and the people  
And the crises in their pains  
For the children's of tomorrow  
For the wars that never end  
Santa Maria  
  
To the sky to the mountain  
To the river to the valley  
To my hometown to my country  
To the place were I was born  
To the heroes that we need today  
For the lonely with no one to cry  
To the mothers their source of live  
To this world with so much pain  
Santa Maria
