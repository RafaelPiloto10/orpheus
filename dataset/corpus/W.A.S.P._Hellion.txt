Hell-hound, hot leather on your legs  
That smokin powder keg  
You're riding on is hell-bound  
And you're the one they claim  
It's going down in flames  
You're riding Hades' rails (Hellion)  
  
Hellion  
The Devil's Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die  
  
Well child, you're sweatin' and you're stoned  
That alcohol you downed  
Makes you crazy- All night, you damn the hurt and pain  
And drink the devils rain  
It's screaming out your name  
  
Hellion  
The Devil's Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die  
The Gods you worship are steel  
At the altar of rock 'n' roll you kneel  
A slave who forever rocks  
Is chained in the devil's locks  
And slain by the bloody axe I wail  
  
Hellion  
The Devil's Hellion child  
Hellion  
Will never have to die
