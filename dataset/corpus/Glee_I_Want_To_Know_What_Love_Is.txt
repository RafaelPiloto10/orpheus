I gotta take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
Ooh, whoa-oh  
  
This mountain I must climb  
Feels like a world upon my shoulders  
But through the clouds I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
Whoa-oh, oh  
I'm gonna take a little time  
(A little time to look around me)  
I've got nowhere left to hide  
(It looks like love has finally found me)  
  
In my life (In my life)  
(There's been heartache and pain)  
  
(I don't know,) if I can face it again  
(Can't stop now)  
  
I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life (This lonely life)  
  
(Oh) I wanna know what love is  
(Oh, oh!) I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
(Yeah) I know you can show me  
  
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)  
I want you  
  
(To show me) To show me  
(I want to feel what love is) And I know, I know  
(I know you can show me) Let's talk about love, yeah!  
  
(I wanna know what love is) Love that you feel inside  
(I want you to show me) I want you to show me, yeah  
(I wanna feel what love is) No, you just can't hide  
(I know you can show me) Show me, yeah, yeah  
  
Yeah!
