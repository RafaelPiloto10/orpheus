Sometimes I get to a point where  
I don't give a damn about  
anything... anymore  
  
Sometimes I get to a point where  
I feel numb and I just don't care  
  
Sometimes I feel like I just  
don't care  
  
I sit in my car  
and listen to the radio  
  
I think about the past  
and it seems so long ago  
  
I know the pain  
is slowly going to fade  
  
This life is going to get better  
(Things are going to be better)  
  
I wait until  
my ex-wife has gone away  
  
I walk around the house  
Getting lost inside the old days  
  
I see the picture where  
everybody's smiling...  
  
I know...  
I got to keep it on the inside  
  
I want to get lost  
from my life sometimes  
  
Sit on the side  
and watch the world go by  
  
I want to get lost  
and I don't know why  
  
Sometimes I want to get lost  
and I don't know why  
  
(Sometimes I want to get lost  
and dream for a while)  
  
Waiting for my little girl  
Waiting on the school bus  
  
We're going to the movies  
Yeah just the two of us  
  
Sit inside the dark dream  
for a while  
  
Our life is going to get better  
(Yeah it's going to be better)  
  
I wake up weird  
in the middle of the night  
  
I walk up the floor  
until my mind gets right  
  
I think about the past  
and it makes me want to cry  
  
I know...  
I got to keep it on the inside  
  
I want to get lost  
from my life sometimes  
  
Sit on the side  
and watch world go by  
  
I want to get lost in the dark  
and dream for awhile  
  
Just sit inside a dark room  
and dream for awhile  
  
The only thing that ever makes  
sense to me  
Is the words to a song from  
an American movie  
  
The only thing that ever made  
made sense in my life  
Is the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Alive and happy in  
the summertime  
  
I am just like everyone I know  
  
I am afraid of things that I  
don't know  
  
I am afraid of ever really  
being alone  
  
I want to find myself a brand  
new heart  
  
I want to find a girl  
and make a brand new start  
  
I want to find a girl and get lost  
in the dark  
  
The only thing that ever makes  
sense to me  
Is the words to a song from  
an American moive  
  
The only thing that ever made  
made sense in my life  
Is the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Through the window of a  
summer night  
  
I sit alone in the backyard  
Wishing I could be inside  
  
Just the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Makes me happy just to be alive  
  
Sometimes I am happy  
just to be alive
