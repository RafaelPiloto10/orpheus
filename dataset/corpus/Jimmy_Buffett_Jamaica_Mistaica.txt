Some folks say that I've got the perfect life  
Three swell kids, lots of toys and a lovely wife  
I fly, I sail, I throw caution to the wind  
Drift like a stratus cloud above the Caribbean  
  
But every now and then, the dragons come to call  
Just when you least expect it you'll be dodgin' cannonballs  
I've seen too much not to stay in touch  
With a world full of love and luck  
I've got a big suspicion 'bout ammunition  
I never forget to duck  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back, come back back to Jamaica  
Don't chu know we made a big mistaica  
We'd be so sad if you told us good-bye  
And we promise not to shoot you out of the sky  
  
It was a beautiful day, the kind you want to toast  
We were tree top flyin' movin' west along the coast  
Then we landed in the water, just about my favorite thrill  
When some asshole started firing as we taxied to Negril  
  
Just about to lose my temper as I endeavored to explain  
We had only come for chicken we were not a ganja plane  
Well, you should have seen their faces when they finally realized  
We were not some coked up cowboy sporting guns and alibis  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They shot from the lighthouse, they shot from highway  
They shot from the top of the cliff, they had all gone haywire  
We're catchin' fire, and there wasn't even a spliff  
  
Well, the word got out all over the island  
Friends, strangers, they were all apologizin'  
Some thought me crazy foe being way too nice  
But it's just another shitty day in paradise  
  
[Chorus]
