You stole my heart the moment you came to town  
I said hello but you were gone when I turned around  
You can't get away, can't get away, even if you try now  
I want to tell you but the words just can't be found  
  
I like the way you move and just the way you are  
I can't take anymore, 'cause girl, you're pushin' too hard  
You can't get away, can't let you go, what's a boy to do now  
You got me askin' myself how I survived this far  
  
[Chorus:]  
I gotta get away from you, girl  
'Cause I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you  
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do  
Never been afraid of, never been afraid of love 'til I met you  
Ooh, yes you say  
  
Can't be something that you never ever had  
When I stop and think about you, it makes me laugh  
You took me by surprise, I saw it in your eyes, I never had a chance, girl  
Now that I see what you are, it doesn't hurt so bad  
  
[Chorus]
