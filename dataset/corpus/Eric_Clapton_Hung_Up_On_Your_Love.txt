I was ready to take a chance,  
I found myself a new romance.  
Then you call that same old night,  
Always change my mind.  
  
Oh no, not again.  
Oh no, not again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just when I thought it was over, you come back  
And I'm hung up on your love again.  
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.  
Now I'm hung up on your love again.  
  
Just as I was doing good,  
You come back, just to prove you could.  
Things will always be the same,  
With me the victim of the game.  
  
Oh no, not again.  
Oh no, not again.  
  
[Chorus: x4]
