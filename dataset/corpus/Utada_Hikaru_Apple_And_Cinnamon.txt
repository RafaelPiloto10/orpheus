Tell me what is on your mind  
Help me, 'cause I'd like to know  
What the hell is going on?  
Never thought I'd sing this song  
  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Happiness don't last that long  
But what we had was beautiful  
  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Please don't look at me like that, oh  
Please don't look at me, don't look at me like that, oh  
You can't look at me like that, aah  
Please don't look at me, don't look at me like that, oh  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last
