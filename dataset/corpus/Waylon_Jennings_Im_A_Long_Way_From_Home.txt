I'm a long way from home and so all alone homesick like I never thought I'd be  
I'm a long way from home everything is wrong someone please watch over me  
I'm not a custom to this feeling loneliness is burning in my soul  
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told  
  
I wish I knew the force within me that keeps my mind out of control  
What makes me reach for things that I can't see  
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told  
I'm a long way from home...
