I'se The be'why that builds the boat and  
I'se The be'why that sails her and  
I'se The be'why that catches the fish and  
Brings 'em home to Liza  
  
[Chorus]  
Hip-yer-partner Sally Tibbo  
Hip-yer-partner Sally Brown  
Fogo, Twillingate, Morton's Harbour,  
All around the circle  
  
Sods and rinds to cover your flake,  
Cake and tea for supper  
Cod fish in the spring of the year,  
Fried in maggoty butter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want your maggoty fish  
They're no good for winter  
Well I can buy as good as that,  
Way down in Bonavista!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I took Liza to a dance,  
As fast as she can travel,  
And every step that she could take,  
Was up to her knees in gravel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Susan White she's outta sight,  
Her petticoat wants a border,  
Well old Sam Oliver in the dark,  
He kissed her in the corner!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'se The be'why that builds the boat and  
I'se The be'why that sails her and  
I'se The be'why that catches the fish and  
Brings 'em home to Liza  
  
[Chorus]
