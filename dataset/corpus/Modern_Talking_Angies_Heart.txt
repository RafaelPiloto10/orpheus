Every little moment  
Oh, she dreams of you  
Half a million miles of love come true  
How can you mend all the heartaches you've made ?  
  
What is easy for two, is so hard for one  
What is gonna happen when the summer's gone ?  
How can you mend all the heartaches that you've made ?  
Baby, how can you mend all the heartaches that you've made ?  
  
Someone is breaking Angie's heart  
What about the thing called love ?  
He's breaking Angie's heart  
Her heart, her heart  
  
Someone is breaking Angie's heart  
One night is not enough  
Everybody got to believe in someone  
Ooh Angie  
  
Angie, there will never be another you  
If it doesn't fit that your dreams come true  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?  
Tears of love, you wasted for this love affair  
  
And his love will really hurt you, oh to care  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?  
Baby, how can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?
