If you've been feeling blue  
Hey, it's been the same for me  
Now I'm here with you  
You're exactly what I need  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me show you now  
This heart to heart is meant to be  
  
Everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
A connection between you and me  
Can't you see it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
We've got magic here, it's the power of love I know  
It's dancing in the air, I can feel the feeling grow  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me hold you now  
And I won't ever let you go  
  
Everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
Nothing's ever gonna separate us  
You and me, it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me hold you now  
And I won't ever let you go  
  
Say, everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
A connection between you and me  
Can't you see it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
(it's a matter of love)
