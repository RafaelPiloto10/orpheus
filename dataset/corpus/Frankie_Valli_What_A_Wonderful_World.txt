I see trees of green, red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I say to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
I see skies of blue, clouds of white  
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  
And I say to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ?How do you do??  
They're really saying is, ?I love you?  
  
I hear babies cry, I've watched them grow  
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  
And I say to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ?How do you do??

They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  
And I say to myself  
What a wonderful world  
What a wonderful world
