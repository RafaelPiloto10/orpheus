Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good  
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes  
The sun is shining so I head for the park,  
With a bottle of Tequila, and a new pack of cigarettes  
  
I got a cousin and she got a friend,  
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help  
At his apartment I knocked on the door,  
He wouldn't come out until he got paid.  
Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through.  
  
It's no fun being an illegal alien  
It's no fun being an illegal alien  
  
Down at the office had to fill out the forms  
A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose,  
Up to the counter to see what they think  
They said 'It doesn't count man, it ain't written in ink'.  
Don't trust anybody least not around here, cause  
  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
An illegal alien, O.K.  
  
Consideration for your fellow man  
Wouldn't hurt anybody, sure fits in with my plan  
Over the border, there lies the promised land  
  
So don't tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through.  
  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien.
