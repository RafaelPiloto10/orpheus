Some days I think this old machine is out to get me  
Some days she does what I tell her  
It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week  
I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar  
  
I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do  
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe, could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention  
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you  
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul  
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who  
  
I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut  
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru  
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea  
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me  
  
I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules  
So say a little prayer every day  
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain  
You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way  
  
I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do  
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe, could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels
