I am a mosaic  
That was found at  
The bottom of your garden  
I'm just wondering but the crack begin to show  
Look closely and then you'll know  
Then you'll know  
  
I am a beauty that once was  
Tell the country nothing something special  
But never out of your league of  
Battle with this twice now  
He came to me said  
"heres how"  
Spoke a single line  
And we dance in our scene  
I'll just die in your arms  
And my life is complete  
  
I am a mosaic  
That was found when you didn't know any better  
I am broken now (x3)  
And image that is scattered  
Around and (x5)  
A million ways I, I  
Didn't have to hurt (x3)  
Fought away this twice  
And now all we came to reason  
"heres how"  
Spoke a single line  
We danced in our scene  
I could just die in your arms and my life is complete  
  
Craddled your legs  
And took to your feet  
You're the strongest love  
I ever did meet  
Spoke a single line  
While we danced in our scene  
Just die in your arms and my life is complete
