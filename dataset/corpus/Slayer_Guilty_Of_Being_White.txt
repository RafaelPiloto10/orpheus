I'm sorry  
For something I didn't do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didn't know who  
  
You blame me  
For slavery  
A hundred years before I was born  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Guilty of being white  
  
I'm sorry  
For something I didn't do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didn't know who  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Guilty of being white  
  
I'm convicted  
Of a racist crime  
I've only served  
19 years of my life  
  
I'm sorry  
For something I didn't do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didn't know who  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Guilty of being white  
  
Guilty of being right
