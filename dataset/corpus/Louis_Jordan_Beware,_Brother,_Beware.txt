Now, fellas, yes, you, fellas, listen to me, I got something to tell you  
And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly  
Now pay attention  
  
You see these girls with these fine diamonds, fox furs and fine clothes  
Well, jack, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man that
knows  
They ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them  
You're gonna get yourself a schoolin'  
  
If she saves your dough, and won't go to a show  
Beware, Brother, Beware  
And if she's easy to kiss and never resists  
Becareful, becareful  
  
And if you go for a walk, and she just listens while you talk  
She's tryin' to hook you  
  
And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'  
Don't do it, don't do it  
And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row  
Bring her down front, bring her right down front  
  
If you go for a snack, and she wants a booth in the back  
Watch it, she's tryin' to hook you  
  
And listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk  
And when she goes out with you she wants a hot dog and a malted milk  
  
She's been used to goin' to carnegie hall, and when you take her out night
clubing  
She wants to have one meatball  
  
If she grabs your hand and says, "darling, you're such a nice man"  
Beware, I'm telling you  
  
Listen to me, you thinks he's listening to me  
You better listen to me, I'm telling you what's being put down  
You better pick up on it  
Now listen to this  
  
If her sister calls you brother, you better get further  
I'm telling you, you better hear me  
  
And if she's kind of wild, and she says, "darling, please give me a trial"  
Don't do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her  
If she looks up in your face and just melts into place  
Let her melt, forget it  
  
You think he's paying attention  
Should I ask him about the... Should I...  
But should I tell him about the... Tell him everything, ok I'll tell him  
  
Listen, if she calls you on the phone, and she says,  
"darling, are you all alone?"  
Tell her, "no, you've got three girls with you"  
  
Don't pay no attention to women  
Stand up for your right, be a man, that's right  
  
Should I tell him about the thing...  
Well listen, this is very important  
If you turn out the light and she don't fight  
That's all, that's all,  
That's the end, it's too late  
She's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her  
  
Put down that racing form and pay attention to me  
Now listen  
  
If you get home about two and you don't know what to do  
And you pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you  
Get your business straight  
And set the date, and don't be late  
  
Brother, beware, beware, beware  
Brother, you better beware
