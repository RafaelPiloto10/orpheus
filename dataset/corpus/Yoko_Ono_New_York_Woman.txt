It was getting dark in a snow-covered park  
I thought I saw you smiling  
You left town to marry a Texas millionaire  
I wonder how you are doing  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I love you  
  
I heard him on the air discussing world affairs  
And something about his global vision  
That's when I wondered if you made the right decision  
I want to know what you're thinking  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I miss you  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I miss you  
  
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, my friend  
  
I miss you  
Oh, I miss you  
Oh, I miss you  
Oh, I miss you
