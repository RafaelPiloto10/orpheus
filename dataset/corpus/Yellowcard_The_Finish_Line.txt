Hello friend, it's been too long and every town sings the same sad song.  
Without you here, this hotel year  
will sure slow down, with so much left to hear.  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now  
  
The finish line is almost here  
And someone softly whispers in my ear  
"Times like these, are memories,  
to hold deep down inside of you and me"  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now  
  
I'm not leaving you  
I'm not leaving  
I'm not leaving you  
(Goodbye friend, it won't be long)  
I'm not leaving  
(And until then we'll sing the same sad song)  
  
(Same sad song)  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now
