You make me live  
I wanna say  
Efharisto  
  
I wanna write you a song,  
So you'll understand  
All that you see in my  
Eyes and read in my hand  
Is what I honestly feel  
This time I know that it's for real  
And 'til I find the right way  
This is what I wanna say  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I wanna say  
Efharisto  
  
You are to me like the sun  
So warm in the sky  
You are like sweet summer rain  
As soft as a sigh  
  
You're like the ocean so deep  
Rocking me gently in my sleep  
Don't know where I'm gonna start  
So I just say it from the heart  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I say it from my heart  
For your love  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I wanna say Efharisto  
  
Efharisto  
Efharisto
