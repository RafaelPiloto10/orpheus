Golden sun is rising in the sky  
Emerald birds glide through a rainbow as they fly  
Bringing beauty Holly enters my mind.  
  
Where the crystal ocean finds the shore  
Diamond waves reflect the love we shared before  
Through the silence Holly enters my mind.  
  
All alone as I walk by the sea  
Thoughts of Holly are my company  
For she calls to me with each shining ray  
With each season's change  
With the sun and the sea and the sky she remains.  
  
Though the world must take her far away  
On a velvet wind she comes to me each day  
When I'm lonely Holly enters my mind  
When I'm lonely Holly enters my mind
