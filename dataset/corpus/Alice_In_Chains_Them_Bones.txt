I believe them bones are me  
Some say we're born into the grave  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them bones  
  
Dust rise right on over my time  
Empty fossil of the new scene  
I feel so alone, gonna wind up a  
Big ole pile a them bones  
  
Toll due bad dream come true  
I lie dead gone under red sky  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them  
  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them bones
