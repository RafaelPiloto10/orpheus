When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know that it's only just begun  
Those smiling faces, you know I just can't forget 'em  
But I love you  
  
When I think of all the things I've seen  
And I know that it's only the beginning  
You know those smiling faces, I just can't forget 'em  
But for now, I love you  
  
Just for a little while  
Oh baby, just to see you smile  
Just for a little while  
  
When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know that it's only just begun  
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus, you know I can't forget 'em  
But for now, I love you  
Right this minute, baby now  
I love you  
At least for now, I love you
