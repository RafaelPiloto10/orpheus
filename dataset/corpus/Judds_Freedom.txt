Every dawn becomes a new day  
A time to love, a time to cry  
Every river knows its own way  
And it's the same for you and I  
And every heart must have a reason  
A winding road, a midnight flight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Freedom, freedom  
What we all need is freedom in our hearts  
Freedom, freedom  
What we all need is freedom in our hearts  
  
We fight and die defending honor  
The pride and prejudice we hide  
A mother's tears, a father's anger  
From trying to stop the pain and lies  
So we pretend to look for answers  
While I blame you and you blame me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We don't need the pain anymore  
To move our mountains, to reach our shores  
What I've found is the choice I bring  
What I can do to let freedom ring?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Freedom from the darkness  
Freedom from the violence  
Freedom from the hate  
Freedom from the fear  
Freedom from the hunger  
Freedom from the forgiveness  
Freedom from the past  
Freedom from the mistakes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell the people now  
Freedom, freedom  
What we all need is freedom in our hearts  
Freedom, freedom  
What we all need is freedom in our hearts
