Last year's wishes are this year's apologies  
Every last time I come home  
I take my last chance  
To burn a bridge or two  
I only keep myself this sick in the head  
'Cause I know how the words get you  
  
We're the new face of failure  
Prettier and younger, but not any better off  
Bullet proof loneliness  
At best, at best  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(1x)  
  
Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep  
Out of the woods but I love  
A tree I used to lay beneath  
Kiss teeth stained red  
From a sour bottle baby girl  
With eyes the size of baby worlds  
  
We're the new face of failure  
Prettier and younger, but not any better off  
Bullet proof loneliness  
At best, at best  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(3x)  
  
The best way to make it through  
With hearts and wrists in tact  
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad  
Ain't bad  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(2x)  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
(honeymoon)  
If I woke up next to you  
(honeymoon)
