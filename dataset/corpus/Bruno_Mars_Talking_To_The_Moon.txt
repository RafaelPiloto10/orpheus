I know you're somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away  
I want you back  
I want you back  
My neighbors think I'm crazy  
But they don't understand  
You're all I have  
You're all I have  
  
[Chorus]  
At night when the stars  
Light up my room  
I sit by myself  
Talking to the moon  
Tryin' to get to you  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
Oh  
  
I'm feeling like I'm famous  
The talk of the town  
They say I've gone mad  
Yeah I've gone mad  
But they don't know what I know  
  
'Cause when the sun goes down  
someone's talking back  
Yeah they're talking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ah, ah, ah)  
  
Do you ever hear me calling?  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
'Cause every night  
I'm talking to the moon  
Still trying to get to you  
  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
I know you're somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away
