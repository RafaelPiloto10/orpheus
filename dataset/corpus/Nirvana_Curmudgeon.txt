I can't hide, no  
On the mantle  
I'm not sad  
Tilling that hoe  
  
It's the season  
I'm all reason  
I have seen  
All I have grown  
  
Sheared at the seams  
Cheat on me  
And not seen  
At the seams  
  
I'm a lender  
I'm a planter  
I put something  
In the garden  
  
In the handle  
On the mantle  
I'm not Santa  
I'm a god  
  
I want a lady  
Can you save me?  
It's the sulfur  
I have grown  
  
'Tis the season  
I'm all reason  
I have fleas  
So run on home
