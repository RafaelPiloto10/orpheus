If they had ever told me how sweet a kiss could be  
I would have said, "Impossible, impossible for me"  
And if they said, I'd find you beyond the rainbow's end  
I would have said, "Impossible, impossible, my friend"  
  
To dream about what might have been  
Is strange enough for me  
But now it seems I'm living in  
A dream too beautiful to be  
  
If they had said a moonbeam could calm a stormy sea  
I would have said, "Impossible," but now at last I see  
That nothing is impossible if you are here with me  
  
I would have said, "Impossible," but now at last I see  
That nothing is impossible if you are here with me
