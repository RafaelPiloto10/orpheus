[Verse 1]  
Could You be healer  
To a heart that's been wounded  
In a battle that's never seen  
  
[Verse 2]  
Could You be teacher  
To a mind of confusion  
Tell me what does this all mean  
  
[Verse 3]  
Are You deliverer  
Of an imprisoned feeling in chains  
Can You set my spirit free  
  
And just one more question  
Allow me this question  
Could You be Messiah to me (2x)  
  
[Verse 4]  
Could You be father  
To a soul that's been abandoned  
By a world too busy to hear  
  
[Verse 5]  
Could You be friend  
To a helpless survivor  
Can You take away my fears  
  
[Verse 6]  
I heard them all sharing  
This new found conviction in them  
Are You all that they make You to be  
  
And just one more question  
Allow me this question  
Could You be Messiah to me  
Please be Messiah to me  
  
Now I've been looking for someone like You  
And I'm so tired, I'm tired  
I've read every book and I've sang every song  
  
My mind maybe right but my heart feels so wrong  
Tell me how much further can my life go along  
Which way do the roads lead where do I belong...  
  
Are You forgiver  
Of my most unknown secrets  
Provider of all that I need  
  
Could You be brother  
The one who knows better  
Would You now stand in the lead  
  
When all this is over all the thunder and lightning  
In the daylight just what will I see  
The answers to my questions to all of my questions  
  
Could You be Messiah to me (2x)  
Could You be Messiah  
Please be Messiah to me...
