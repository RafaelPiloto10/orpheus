I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a message in the middle of the bottom  
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em  
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen  
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a-callin  
There's a special way to know you got his lovin'  
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him  
There's a special time for lovin' and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone  
  
I have a feelin' deep inside that I've got you  
I'll keep you. why not? it'll make me feel better  
If there's a woman on this earth who should love you  
It's me boy, don't fight it, admit it, you love it  
If you think there's someone else who can move you  
I'll lose you, no problem, you're free to go get her  
I just refuse to let a lady step in on my show  
If you choose, do it now or forget it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a special time for lovin' and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone.  
  
Message in the middle of the bottom [Repeat: x5]
