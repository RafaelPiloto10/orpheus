Home for the holidays,  
I believe I've missed each and every face,  
Come on and play my music,  
Let's turn on the love light in the place  
  
It's time I found myself,  
Totally surrounded in your circles  
Whoa, my friends  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
That I'll always remember,  
And I can recall,  
Whenever I find myself too all alone,  
I can sing me home.  
  
Uneasy highway,  
Traveling where the Westerly winds can fly,  
Somebody tried to tell me,  
But the men forgot to tell me why,  
  
I gotta count on being gone,  
Come on woman, come on daddy,  
Be what you want from me,  
I'm this strong, I'll be weak  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
That I'll always remember,  
I can recall,  
Whenever I find myself too all alone,  
I can make believe I've never gone,  
I never know where I belong,  
Sing me home.  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate me home  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,
