Since my baby left me  
I found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street at heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely I could die  
Although it's always crowded  
I still can find some room  
Where those broken hearted lovers  
Cry away their gloom, oh!  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely  
Get so lonely I could die  
Bellhop's tears keep flowing  
Desk clerk dressed in black  
They been so long on lonely street  
They ain't never comin' back  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely  
Get so lonely I could die  
If your baby leaves you  
And you have a tale to tell  
Just take a walk  
Down lonely street to heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely I could die
