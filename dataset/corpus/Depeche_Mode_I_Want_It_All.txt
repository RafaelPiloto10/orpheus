I see a river  
It's oceans that I want  
You have to give me everything  
But everything's not enough  
  
It's my desire  
To give myself to you  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I try  
Sometimes I lie with you  
Sometimes I cry  
Sometimes I die it's true  
Somewhere I find something that's kind in you  
  
And I've crossed the line again  
A line I drew in sand  
And still you give me everything  
But everything's not enough  
  
I'm ready but not willing  
To give myself to you  
Sometimes  
  
Come on over lay down beside me  
And I'll try  
Come on over lay down beside me  
And I'll try  
And I'll try  
  
I want it all
