I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow  
Let it take me where I want to go  
Till you open the door, there's so much more  
I've never seen it before  
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings  
But you came along and you changed everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
  
I watched from a distance as you made life your own  
Every sky was your own kind of blue  
And I wanted to know how that would feel  
And you made it so real  
You showed me something that I couldn't see  
You opened my eyes and you made me believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier oh  
  
Baby you showed me what livin' is for  
I don't wanna hide anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier!
