I'm so alone now  
Turn to stone now  
Won't someone free me  
Love me or need me  
Surrounded by lovers I stand apart  
Won't someone hold me  
When I am lonely  
Let the sun shine on my golden heart  
Music's playing  
I'm still praying  
Venus made me  
Eros betrayed me  
Instead of love's arrow  
He used a poison dart  
So if you could love me  
Take good care of me  
You'd take this spell off my golden heart  
I used to dance and  
I knew romance till  
A dagger of glass tore my world apart  
But if you could hold me  
When I am lonely  
I'd love you back with a golden heart
