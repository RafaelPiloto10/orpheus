Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye  
Oh no one else could take her place in my life  
Oh we had something good  
So tell me why she would  
Go and make me cry  
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye  
  
I remember how she'd hold me  
And say she'd stay forever true  
Back when the future looked so rosy  
But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue  
  
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye  
Oh no one else could take her place in my life  
Oh we had something good  
So tell me why she would  
Go and make me cry  
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye  
  
Don't know what I didn't give her  
That she gets from someone new  
I only know how much I miss her  
And wish my heart was only broke in two  
  
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye  
Oh no one else could take her place in my life  
Oh we had something good  
So tell me why she would  
Go and make me cry  
Oh me, oh my  
Why did she go and make me cry  
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
