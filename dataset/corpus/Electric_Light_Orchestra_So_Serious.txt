Night after night, I try to make it all fit together  
Night after night, I see you as someone I remember  
You took me by surprise, opened up my eyes  
Now we gotta talk this over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious  
  
Day after day, I know it's not the way that you wanted it  
Day after day, I try to find the key but it don't fit  
But you know how it is, no matter what I did  
We gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'm thinking over everything you said to me  
Tonight, tonight, I'm sorry but I just didn't see  
And now it's up to you, there's nothing else to do  
We've gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious
