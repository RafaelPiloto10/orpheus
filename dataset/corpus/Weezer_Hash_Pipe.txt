Uhhh!  
I can't help my feelings  
I'll go out of my mind  
These playas out to get me  
'Cause they like my behind  
I can't love my business  
If I can't get a trick  
Down on Santa Monica where tricks aren't for kids  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa,  
C'mon and kick me  
Whoa,  
C'mon and kick me  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
C'mon and kick me-e-e  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
You got your problems  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
I got my eyes wide  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
You got your big G's  
I got my hash pipe  
  
Uhhh!  
I can't help my bookies  
They get out of control  
I know that you don't care  
But I want you to know  
The least likely flavor is from the favorite treat  
Abandon the bottle for the taste of her teat  
  
[Chorus: x2]
