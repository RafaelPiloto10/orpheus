You can put it down to lack of patience  
You can put it down to lack of sleep  
But it's in my head to stay in bed  
Tucked under the sheets  
They said if you try to get on I'd get on  
They said there were chances  
But now my chance has gone  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep  
Now it may be a sad reflection  
On the way young people feel  
But early Monday morning  
Is losing its appeal  
I open my curtains at 7a.m.  
Just so you think I'm up with the rest of the men  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep  
You'd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a break  
But that's one risk you'd never take  
The evenings yours, the mornings mine  
But don't knock me, I'm doing fine  
You'd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a rest  
But just for now you know what's best  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep
