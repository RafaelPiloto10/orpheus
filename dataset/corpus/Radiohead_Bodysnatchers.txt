I do not  
Understand  
What it is  
I've done wrong  
Full of holes  
Check the pulse  
Blink your eyes  
One for yes  
Two for no  
  
I have no idea what I am talking about  
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out  
Oh  
  
Make a sound  
Move back home  
Get an invitation  
With the edges  
Sawn off  
  
I have no idea what you are talking about  
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out  
Oh  
  
Has the light gone out for you?  
Cause the light's gone for me  
It is the 21st century  
It is the 21st century  
You can fight it like a dog  
And they brought me to my knees  
They got scared and they put me in  
They got scared and they put me in  
All the lies run around my face  
All the lies run around my face  
And for anyone else to see  
And for anyone else to see  
  
I'm alive  
  
I've seen it coming
