I swear sometimes you're taking me for granted  
I swear sometime you're a whore  
I swear but I know there ain't no reason  
Cause everything is such a bore  
  
At night I had a dream, though it made me sick  
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick, (my goodness!)  
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault  
Said it's time that it happened to me  
But I know that the show was much more than a blow  
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low  
Waiting for the tide to get low  
  
If I was an ant, live upon the wall  
Tell me baby would it make any difference at all  
If I was a roach on a tree tell me would you smoke me?  
Bright lights put me in a trance  
But it ain't house music, makes me want to dance (word)  
I don't gamble but I bet  
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette  
Hold me close I always play the mack  
With the monkey on my back.
