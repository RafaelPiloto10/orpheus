Ain't nobody else but you [Repeat x3]  
  
There is nobody  
Who can make me cry  
Nobody can do  
Nobody but you (2x)  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There is nobody  
Who can make me lie  
Nobody else can do it  
Nobody but you [Repeat x2]  
Ain't nobody else but you  
Nobody, nobody but you  
Gimme one more chance to make it right  
Time has come for us to reunite  
Baby it's true  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There's no one like you  
  
There is nobody  
Who can make it right  
Nobody else can do  
Nobody but you  
You know what to do  
Nobody else but you  
Nobody, nobody but you  
Somebody tell me  
Cause I can't eat or sleep  
When you're not close to my body  
You're a bittersweet delight  
Come and help me through the night  
  
Ain't nobody else can make me cry  
Ain't nobody else can make me lie  
Nobody but you  
Ain't nobody else but you  
Nobody but you  
Gimme one more chance to make it right  
Time has come for us to reunite  
Cause baby it's true  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There's no one like you
