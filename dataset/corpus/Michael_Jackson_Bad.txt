Your butt is mine  
Gonna tell you right  
Just show your face  
In broad daylight  
I'm telling you  
On how I feel  
Gonna hurt your mind  
Don't shoot to kill  
Come on  
  
Come on  
Lay it on me  
All right  
  
I'm giving you  
On count of three  
To show your stuff  
Or let it be  
I'm telling you  
Just watch your mouth  
I know your game  
What you're about  
  
Well they say the sky's the limit  
And to me that's really true  
But my friend you have seen nothin'  
Just wait 'til I get through  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I'm bad, I'm bad come on  
You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know  
You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know  
And the whole world has to  
Answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
Who's bad  
  
The word is out  
You're doin' wrong  
Gonna lock you up  
Before too long  
Your lyin' eyes  
Gonna tell you right  
So listen up  
Don't make a fight  
Your talk is cheap  
You're not a man  
You're throwin' stones  
To hide your hands  
  
But they say the sky's the limit  
And to me that's really true  
And my friends you have seen nothin'  
Just wait 'til I get through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can change the world tomorrow  
This could be a better place  
If you don't like what I'm sayin'  
Then won't you slap my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who's bad?
