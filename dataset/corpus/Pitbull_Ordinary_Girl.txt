Chorus:  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
Can't help thinking about all the things she said  
She said good girls are just like bad girls  
If she's a bad girl, then makes her a good girl!  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head!  
  
I'm in the club, in love with this girl that's been dancing for me  
I know she likes, cause she tells me she don't want my money  
I think she's special, yow, I'm certain she's got what I need  
She ain't the girl next door, but she's perfect for me!  
Cause the way she moves, the way she smells, the way she feels I can tell
it...  
... Get out of this shit  
Baby never look back, I don't care about the past  
Yeah I know about life, what to do with the bad  
Must to... Turn right when the day needs right  
  
Chorus:  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
Can't help thinking about all the things she said  
She said good girls are just like bad girls  
If she's a bad girl, then makes her a good girl!  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head!  
  
Man, I went crazy when she hit the floor  
... Everyone wants to know  
Who she is, because she want new, new in town  
And you can tell by the way she dance, she can put it down  
And at this point I'm just fantasizing with this girl now  
And my mind is playing tricks on me  
Is ay my mind...
