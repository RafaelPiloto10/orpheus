Love takes time we all agree  
and time's not the easiest to cheat  
The water changes one degree  
When will the shiver  
of this river  
turn to sea  
  
The river does no good, no harm  
Tempts us like pirates to its calm  
Lover's shanty, devil's psalm  
Goddamn this river  
and its shiver  
and its charm  
  
If you've got love's A to Z  
Don't go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This river's hooked the floating dead  
  
Our lives go bounding down the strewn  
When will we realize minnow dreams  
The frustration eating you and me  
Our only wish  
to be the fish  
that meets the sea  
  
We cannot tell a he or she  
But us fish can tell a we  
We know the seed we know the tree  
When will my conker  
conquer thee  
  
The cheaper woman and myself  
We've both got ladders in our tights  
When you've been left on the top shelf  
You've got those ladders in your sights
