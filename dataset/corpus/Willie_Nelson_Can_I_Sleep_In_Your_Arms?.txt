Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong  
  
Don't know why but the one I love left me  
Left me lonely and cold and so weak  
And I need someone's arms to hold me till  
I'm strong enough to get back on my feet  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong  
  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong
