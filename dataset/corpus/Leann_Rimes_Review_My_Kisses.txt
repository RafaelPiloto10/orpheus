I'm only happy when I'm with you  
I only feel good when I'm talking to you  
And I'm a mess when you don't call me  
Call me at night  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
And did you think of me  
  
It's hard to breathe  
And my heart's sinking  
I'm slipping fast  
As I am reaching for you  
It's gonna hurt cause  
I have been there before  
Can't take much more  
Can't take another night  
Without you here beside me  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to review my kisses  
On every inch of your body  
I want to reveal my secrets  
That only you should know  
I feel all this pain inside me  
That only your lips can make better  
I want to review my kisses  
So you won't forget that you are mine  
  
Don't want to care  
More than you do  
Don't want to be the one  
Who's out in the rain  
Don't want to get that  
Call where you sound so cold  
So far away, so far away  
Like the distant roll of thunder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a cave in the darkness  
And I'm lost inside you  
Don't go  
  
I want to review my kisses  
On every inch of your body  
I want to reveal my secrets  
That only you should know  
I feel like a childless mother  
Longing to hold her baby  
If I could review my kisses  
Then you won't forget that you are mine
