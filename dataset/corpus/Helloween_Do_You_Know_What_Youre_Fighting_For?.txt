Day by day you work off your claws  
The line of fate in them may not pay your loans  
You got to keep going and going on strive  
Day by day  
  
Do you know? Ooh, do you know? Ooh..  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Disenchantment, alienation  
A slog to feed future, estranged generations  
And retired, will you get rewarded  
Your brave restraint?  
  
Do you know? Ooh, do you know? Ooh..  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Ooh, will they need you?  
Will they pay you?
