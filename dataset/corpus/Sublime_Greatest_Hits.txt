Wake up in the morning and it's hard to live.  
Hard to live, yes, it's hard to live  
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give,  
And every single day it's getting harder to give,  
But God would be up for being down with a ho.  
Lord knows that I got fuckin' mic control.  
Do you got the mic control?  
You notice your style is well original.  
  
This man, makin money,  
How I know.  
It won't be no man of me.  
In my bed I watch T.V.  
I'm drunk by noon,  
But that's O.K.  
I'll be president someday.  
Light my cigarette and  
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink.  
Load the box and then pump that shit.  
Got my greatest hits.  
Got my greatest hits.  
  
Is this band, makin money?  
I don't know.  
The writing on the wall.  
All my friends drink alcohol.  
I'm too drunk to light the bong.  
I'm too stoned to write this song.  
Light my cigarette and  
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink.  
Load the box and then pump that shit.  
Got my greatest hits  
  
Wake up in the morning and it's hard to live.  
Hard to live, hard to live  
It's hard to live and it will be a long time  
Before shit starts to give,  
And every single day it's getting harder to give,  
But God would be up for being down with a ho.  
Lord knows that I got fuckin' mic control.  
Do you got mic control?  
You notice your style is well original.

Light my cigarette and

Load the box and then pump that shit.  
It's the Ziggens Greatest Hit,  
The Ziggens Greatest Hit,  
The Ziggens his Great-est Hit
