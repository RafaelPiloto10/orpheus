Constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
Steer your life by these stars  
On the unconditional chance  
'Tis here where Hell and Heaven dance  
This is the constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
Well we think you'd better wake up capt'n  
There's something happen'n up ahead  
We've never seen anything like it  
We've never seen anything like it before  
  
I want a full report  
That's it  
What do you mean, "That's it?"  
That's all you get  
You'd better do something 'bout it  
What am I supposed to do about it?  
We don't know, but you can't run away from it  
Maybe you'd better face it  
I can't do that  
C'mon face it!  
I can't do that  
C'mon, c'mon face it  
What am I gonna do?  
It is gonna hurt, it is gonna hurt me bad?  
  
Ooh here's the constellation of the heart  
  
Who said anything about it hurting?  
It's gonna be beautiful  
It's gonna be wonderful  
It's gonna be paradise  
  
(Just being alive, it can really hurt...)  
Ooh find me the man with the ladder  
And he might lift me up to the stars  
  
(Without the pain there'd be no learning  
Without the hurting we'd never change.)  
  
Oooh and if you see the woman with the key  
I hear she's opening up the doors to Heaven  
Oh and here comes the man with the stick  
He said he'd fish me out of the moon  
  
Ohoh here's the constellation of the heart  
It is the constellation of the heart  
  
Oh yes it is the constellation of the heart
