Stretching, filing,  
Against her skin,  
Blessed are those,  
Who are not kin,  
In sin we breathe,  
In sex we tie,  
Duct tape her legs,  
To the red sky,  
Foolsome flesh allowances,  
The pansies raided the pantry of,  
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous,  
Delight, deny not the flavor,  
Custard dreams,  
Abusing, musing,  
Marmalade flesh  
Naked spread am I,  
  
Actors of the tragic fanthom,  
Extend your legs to great saturn,  
Brown table tops scream for cover,  
At the sight of your new lover,  
If today I die,  
And can't deny,  
The poison chosen,  
For tonight.  
Borrowed dreams,  
Hollowed reveries,  
Metal pillows,  
Pewter yellows,  
Furry roadkill,  
House on the hill,  
Pouring gravy,  
On her thighs still,  
If today I die,  
And can't deny,  
The poison chosen,  
For tonight.  
  
Borrowed dreams,

House on the hill,  
Pouring gravy,  
On her thighs still,  
  
If today I die,  
And can't deny,  
The poison chosen,  
For tonight.
