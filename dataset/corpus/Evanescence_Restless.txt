She embraced  
With a smile  
As she opened the door  
A cold wind blows  
It puts a chill  
Into my heart  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my love I gave to you  
  
(killer guitar riff)  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart

Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my love I gave to you
