The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee  
The white men came to trade and borrow  
But then they would not leave  
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea  
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery  
We welcomed them as brothers, knowing nothing of their greed  
Born hunters not the hunted, as the white man hunts for me  
We are descendants of the animals we live among them free  
Our trail of tears would end, one day at wounded knee  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
When we do the ghost dance, the buffalo will return  
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn  
Great spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky  
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Red cloud, black hawk, sitting bull  
Crazy horse, Geronimo  
Strong and brave  
Warriors to the grave  
There has been much killing  
There will be much more  
The medicine man is dancing  
He's calling us to war  
Hatchets sing with pride  
Let the white men die  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me
