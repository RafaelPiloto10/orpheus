Told you once about your friends and neighbours  
They were always seeking but they'll never find it  
It's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Where to go and where to see  
It's always been this way and it can never be  
It's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Give it all and ask no return  
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn  
That's it's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Don't you know that it's so good for you  
You can be making love and see it all go through  
But it's alright, yes it's alright
