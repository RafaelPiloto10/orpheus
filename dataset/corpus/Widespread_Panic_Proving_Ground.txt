I really wanna move like I'd like to  
Sometimes I remember myself  
I really wanna feel like I'm supposed to  
Sometimes I remember how to feel  
  
How did I find myself just this way  
My body keeps on moving  
But my style gets in my way  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
By jumping in the middle of a river  
  
Well, we were shaking cliches like we used to  
You just remember the smell  
Breaking my brain like a boy who just  
Can't forget her smell  
  
Now, how do you like the way I drive  
Take us a little bit different way every next time (time)  
  
Find out just how dry I am  
By jumping the middle of a river  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
How tall I am  
  
I really wanna move like I'd like to  
Sometimes I remember myself  
I really wanna feel like I'm supposed to  
Sometimes I remember how to feel  
  
How did I find myself just this way  
My body keeps moving  
But my thoughts get in the way  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
By jumping in the middle
