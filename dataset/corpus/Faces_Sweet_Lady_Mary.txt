Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head  
Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed  
I tried to help her, but I did not know how  
I tried to love her, but it's all over now  
Nothing left to comfort me, except a sunny day  
Steal away, steal away  
  
Over the stones along the dusty old road  
With every footstep one more tale is told  
With every turning one more side to see  
Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me  
A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget  
The lady lied with every breath, I accept  
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit  
I knew all along I'd have to quit.  
Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
I think I'll go back home and start all again  
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain  
And on a new day when I've mended the wound  
Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound  
But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time  
I better steal away, steal away  
  
Ooh-hoo  
Steal away-ay.
