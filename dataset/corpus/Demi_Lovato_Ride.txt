I'm gonna rock this place like outta space  
Give you something that you never had  
I'm gonna paint my nails  
And style my hair  
And save me a strawberry bubble bath  
  
I'm gonna sweep my mind  
And the time I'll find  
That I got summet to say  
I'm gonna jump around  
And paint this town  
Let me hear you say  
Hey  
  
Take me, take me down, take me down  
Ride  
Now follow, follow me now, follow me now  
Ride  
  
Turn it up
