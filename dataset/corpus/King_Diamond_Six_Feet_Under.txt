My family just couldn't wait, I should have seen it coming  
What a nice CONSPIRACY, what a nice surprise  
But now it's all too late  
I am six feet under, It's so very hard to breath  
My family, they put me here in a coffin made of glass  
So I can see them in their glory or they can see me in my misery  
They're standing all around my grave  
  
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass  
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath  
  
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass  
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath  
My hands are turning blue  
While my nails are turning to Red  
  
Looking up into faces of greed  
I'm sweating cold and white with fear  
Sinister smiles upon their lips  
One of them is waving me goodbye  
I am six feet under, It's so very hard to breath  
My lovely sister is laughing at me, I cannot hear but I can see  
Now she is kicking soil into my face  
I swear I will return to haunt her  
  
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass  
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath  
My hands are turning blue  
While my nails are turning to Red
