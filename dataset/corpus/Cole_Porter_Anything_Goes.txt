Times have changed  
And we've often rewound the clock  
Since the Puritans got a shock  
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.  
If today  
Any shock they should try to stem  
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  
Plymouth Rock would land on them.  
  
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking.  
But now, God knows,  
Anything goes.  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four-letter words  
Writing prose.  
Anything goes.  
If driving fast cars you like,  
If low bars you like,  
If old hymns you like,  
If bare limbs you like,  
If Mae West you like,  
Or me undressed you like,  
Why, nobody will oppose.  
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-  
Truding in nudist parties in  
Studios.  
Anything goes.  
  
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)  
Can get Russian reds to "yes" her,  
Then I suppose  
Anything goes.  
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-  
Ough money to let Max Gordon  
Produce his shows,  
Anything goes.  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today,  
And black's white today,  
And day's night today,  
And that gent today  
You gave a cent today  
Once had several chateaux.  
When folks who still can ride in jitneys  
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys  
Lack baby clo'es,  
Anything goes.  
  
If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction  
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,  
Then Anna shows  
Anything goes.  
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up  
Now turns a handspring landing up-  
On her toes,  
Anything goes.  
Just think of those shocks you've got  
And those knocks you've got  
And those blues you've got  
From that news you've got  
And those pains you've got  
(If any brains you've got)  
From those little radios.  
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,  
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons  
'Cause Franklin knows  
Anything goes.
