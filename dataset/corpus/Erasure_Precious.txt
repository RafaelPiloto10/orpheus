The ebb and flow of the tide  
Will carry me forth into your arms  
And though I'll miss you tonight  
The thought of your love keeps me warm  
As the moon comes out over the water  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep  
The river sleeping sound  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
Soul will keep thee, rife and weepy, calling out to you  
The dip and roar of the crowd  
Will dizzy me forth into your arms  
And if we pass it all around  
We'll be of the same point of view  
As the world spins round, here ever after  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep  
The river sleeping sound  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
On a bed of silver sand  
I'll take you lightly by the hand  
And we'll dance on by the moon  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
Shattered, dreamy, calm and sweetly, fool enough for two  
When the stars play hide and seek  
I shall be dreaming deep of you (I shall be dreaming)  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep (I shall be praying)  
On a bed of silver sand  
I'll take you lightly by the hand (I shall be dreaming)  
And we'll dance on by the moon  
I shall be dreaming deep of you (I shall be praying)
