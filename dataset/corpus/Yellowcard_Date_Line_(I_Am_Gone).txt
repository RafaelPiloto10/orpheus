Is this just a matter of  
Me getting what I needed  
Till I was safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline?  
And it's just a matter of  
Me keeping myself seated  
Till the pilot killed the overdrive  
And landed in a place where you can't  
Find me there  
Find me there  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secret's safe  
And you call my name  
Then I am gone  
  
I'm tired of you and me (tired of you and me)  
And the space that's in between (space that's in between)  
And I would rather be somewhere with better thoughts and warmer air  
I'm tired of trying to be (tired of trying to be)  
Somebody different than me (different than me)  
I'm tired of trying to shine it on  
When the lights go out tonight, I'm gone  
I'll run from here  
Run  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secret's safe  
And you call my name  
When the hurt gets real  
And you still can't feel  
When you can't escape  
And you cannot stay  
Then I am gone  
  
Safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline  
I landed in a place that you can't find  
You can't find me there  
You can't find me there  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secret's safe  
And you call my name  
When the hurt gets real (the hurt gets real)  
And you still can't feel (still can't feel)  
When you can't escape (can't escape)  
And you cannot stay  
Then I am gone  
  
Safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline  
I landed in a place that you can't find  
  
When the last plane leaves  
And you cry for me  
When you lie awake  
And you feel it break  
Then I am gone
