I'm gonna stick by you, everyday  
I won't let you down now  
No matter what they say  
I won't let them get to you, no way  
I'll stick by you  
I'm going to stick by you  
Now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I won't let you go  
I won't let them get to you, oh no  
  
I'll stick by you  
And when the laughter seems to fade away  
And Mr Sun becomes a rainy day  
Oh I don't matter cause you'll know anyway  
I won't let you down  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'll stick by you  
  
Going to stick by you, now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I won't let them get to you, no  
I'll stick by you, I'll stick by you  
I'll stick by you, I'll stick by you
