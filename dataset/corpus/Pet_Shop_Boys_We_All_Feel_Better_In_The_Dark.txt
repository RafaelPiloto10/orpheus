The music's pumping through me, I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me, the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me, and I know I want it now  
These feelings that I'm feeling must be satisfied somehow  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My body surges with energy, shivers down my spine  
I look deep into your eyes, and I know that you'll be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The music's pumping through me, I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me, the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me, and I know I want it now  
These feelings that I'm feeling must be satisfied somehow  
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it!  
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it!  
  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
  
[Chorus]
