I'm depending on you  
Everything that you do  
I'm depending on you  
To see me through  
You know that I love you  
And there is nothing I can do  
But depend on you  
I'm depending on you  
This is our last chance  
And I'm depending on you  
To try to save our romance  
Because you're the only girl  
That I understand  
When you tell me I'm your man  
Promise me that you will never leave me  
Promise me that you will never say goodbye  
Promise me that you will never break my heart  
And now you're making me cry  
I'm depending on you  
This is our last chance  
I'm depending on you  
Just to try to save our romance  
Because you're the only girl  
That I understand  
Honey, tell me I'm your man
