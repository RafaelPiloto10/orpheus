When you check in the cheatin' hotel, you'll be back  
For another spin at the wheel and a race at the track  
They're off and runnin' down at the bar  
This is Heather - This is John  
They're all down at the cheatin' hotel lookin' for fun  
  
Yea I'm the bartender in here and it's quite a scene  
The women get dressed to kill and slip off their rings  
Their husbands meet them an hour later  
She'll have friends all around the table  
And introduce the old man as one of her latest flings  
  
Then they go out on the dance floor  
Now there's a new man to sway for  
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine  
Then the slow dances get much closer  
And now's the time for low words  
That guy there with your wife's my husband but it's OK  
  
Then I watch all of them leave  
Then they share a stare and a squeeze  
Now I don't know if it's wrong or right  
I'm sure it feels good at the time  
But if you keep on playin' this game you'll lose your mind  
  
'Cause they're thinkin' about him or her  
Then they feel like a piece of dirt  
It's time to check out of the cheatin' hotel and go home for good  
  
We get quite a few attractive lonely wives  
They come in the bar together about six forty-five  
And sit down and say with their eyes  
My friend and I are lookin' for a good time  
It don't take long to find a couple of guys at the cheatin' hotel  
  
And then they go out on the dance floor  
Now they got a new man to sway for  
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine  
Then the slow dances get much closer  
And now they whisper low words  
Are you married, why yes I am but that's OK  
  
And they know it's really not, look at all the trouble they got  
If you check in the cheatin' hotel  
Somebody somewhere's gonna tell  
And you'll be in the room from hell and you can't get away  
  
The light blinks on and off  
Bartender last round for us all  
Oh they had a mighty hard fall down here at the cheatin' hotel
