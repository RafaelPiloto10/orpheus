This is metal rhythm  
A new song on the Radio  
Some new face  
A picture on your wall  
Talk to me  
You say it's nothing personal  
But somethings wrong  
It's eating me alive  
I can't fine the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothings's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
I'm On Automatic  
I've heard it all before  
Some new flavour  
With nothing in the hear  
This isn't music  
This is survival  
But I'm still here  
Now isn't that strange  
I can't find the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
Nothing's ever hurt like this
