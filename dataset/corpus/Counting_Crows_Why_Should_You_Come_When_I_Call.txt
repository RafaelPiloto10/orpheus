It's 1:30 in the morning  
That's alright by me  
You just waiting by the phone  
I should give a little warning  
But I need the things I need  
I'm not proud to need a hand  
But I just don't understand  
So, Why should you come when I call  
  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Ain't necessarily a bad thing  
To believe the things I say  
Cause you can make yourself feel good  
You know it's really not a good thing  
  
To give everything to me  
I'm just waiting for the show  
Cause I got no where to go  
So, Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Cause nothing makes me feel so good  
  
Gets me high  
So I sleep at night  
And that's enough and everything  
  
Alright  
I feel nice  
So sorry in the morning  
Could believe what you believe  
  
I'm used to waking up alone  
And if you think about it  
Anyone you think about is a better love than me  
But if you've not fallin' quite asleep?  
  
I might call tonight  
If that's alright  
Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own
