You know they say you best be careful what you're lookin' for  
Everything you want in life to the girl nextdoor  
Well it could happen to you now anyday  
When someone you don't know could blow you away  
  
Better watch out who you trust  
And be careful what you say  
'Cause you know you got too much  
To give it away, give it away  
Give it away, give it away  
  
Along came Mary Jane and her friends  
Knockin'at your door  
Lookin' for some long-term suckers  
Like she's has before  
  
Did you notice me as I noticed you  
From your face  
Don't look so long  
Cause' you're gone from your place  
  
Better watch out who you trust  
And be careful what you say  
'Cause you know you got too much  
To give it away  
  
Now I don't care where you come from  
Or what you do or say  
'Cause you've got way too much to give it away  
  
Something clicked and you're kickin' today  
Something kicked in today  
Feels so good, feels just right  
Gotta find that fun everyday  
  
Don't give it away, give it away  
Give it away, give it away  
Don't throw it away, give it away  
Don't dream it away, give it away!
