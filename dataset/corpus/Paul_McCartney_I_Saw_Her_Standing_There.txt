Well, she was just 17,  
You know what I mean,  
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.  
So, how could I dance with another (ooh)  
And I saw her standin' there.  
  
Well she looked at me, and a I, I could see  
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.  
She wouldn't dance with another (whoo)  
And I saw her standin' there.  
  
Well, my heart went "boom,"  
When I crossed that room,  
And I held her hand in myeee-eee  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night,  
And we held each other tight,  
And before too long I fell in love with her.  
Now I'll never dance with another (whoo)  
And I saw her standing there (ahhh--ha-ha-ha)

Well, my heart went "boom,"  
When I crossed that room,  
And I held her hand in myeee-eee  
  
Oh, we danced through the night,  
And we held each other tight,  
And before too long I fell in love with her.  
Now I'll never dance with another (ooo)  
Since I saw her standing there  
Oh, since I saw her standing there  
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
