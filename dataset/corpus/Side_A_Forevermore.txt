There are times  
When I just want to look at your face  
With the stars in the night  
There are times  
When I just want to feel your embrace  
In the cold of the night  
I just can't believe that you are mine now  
  
You were just a dream that I once knew  
I never thought I would be right for you  
I just can't compare you with  
Anything in this world  
You're all I need to be with forevermore  
  
All those years I've longed to hold you in my arms  
I've been dreaming of you  
Every night,  
I've been watching all the stars that fall down  
Wishing you would be mine  
I just can't believe that you were mine now  
  
You were just a dream that I once knew  
I never thought I would be right for you  
I just can't compare you with  
Anything in this world  
You're all I need to be with forevermore  
  
Time and again  
There are these changes that we cannot end  
Sure a star that keeps going on and on  
My love for you will be forevermore  
  
Wishing you would be mine  
I just can't believe that you were mine now  
  
You were just a dream that I once knew  
I never thought I would be right for you  
I just can't compare you with  
Anything in this world  
As endless as forever  
Our love will stay together  
You're all I need to be with forever more  
(As endless as forever  
Our love will stay together)  
You're all I need  
To be with forevermore
