Remember when I dove  
Into the crowd  
And I got a bloody knee  
Under my skin  
A mark from wiping out  
It brings back the memories  
Every bone's been broken  
And my heart is still wide open  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stop  
Don't care if I lose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
I'm going down in flames for you  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
One more thing I'm addicted too  
  
With each scar there's a map  
That tells a story  
What a souvenir of Young  
Love's like jumping out  
An airplane riding a tidal  
Wave on an ocean of emotion  
My heart rips me wide open  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I cover up these scars  
(We'll make it we'll make it  
But we break it)  
And I can't stop seeing stars  
(Lets hope not die)  
Whenever you're around  
Around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't stop no I can't stop  
No I can't stop  
Oh I'm going out in flames  
Oh I'm going down in flames  
Oh  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose
