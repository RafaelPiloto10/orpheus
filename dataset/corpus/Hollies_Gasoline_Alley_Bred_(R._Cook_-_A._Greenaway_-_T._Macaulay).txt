Woman get your hair out of curlers  
Time to get your butt out of bed  
Get down your hats and your baggage my child  
Goin' back home, gettin' back to the homestead  
  
I'm a-gonna heat me some water  
Put a shine upon my shoes  
Telephone my ma, keep the room above Joe's  
'Cause we're coming back coming back to the homestead  
Everything is packed, gettin' back to the homestead  
This time, this time we'll stay, baby  
  
I know that we could have made it  
We had ideas in our heads  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
But we're Gasoline Alley bred  
Yet the years haven't really been wasted  
And I know it in my head  
We did good for the life that we've tasted  
'Cause we're Gasoline Alley, Gasoline Alley bred  
  
Woman you can really believe it  
I did everything a man could do  
Breaking my back just to make us a dime  
That won't mean a damn when no one wants to know you  
  
Woman I know how you feel it  
I've seen the hurt upon your face  
How many time do you think that I've cried  
Knowing every day that your heart was getting broken  
Holding back your pride till you were nearly choking  
Oh, let's get away, baby  
  
I know that we could have made it  
We had ideas in our heads  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
But we're Gasoline Alley bred  
Yet the years haven't really been wasted  
And I know it in my head  
We did good for the life that we've tasted  
'Cause we're Gasoline Alley, Gasoline Alley bred  
  
(Gasoline Alley) Gasoline Alley Bred  
(Gasoline Alley) Gasoline Alley Bred  
(Gasoline Alley) Gasoline Alley Bred  
(Gasoline Alley) Gasoline Alley Bred
