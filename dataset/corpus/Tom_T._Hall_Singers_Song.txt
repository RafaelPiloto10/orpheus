Now that I know what I know why did the learning come so slow  
There are deeds that I have done there in the songs I've sung  
And no building stands with my name on the side  
I've left no trails for little kids to ride  
God had his wish and I had mine  
He gave me words and I made them rhyme  
If there's good in what I bring it's in the songs I sing  
So let me sing and go on by build your castles to the sky  
I make mine with words and tones and so I work alone  
And no building stands
