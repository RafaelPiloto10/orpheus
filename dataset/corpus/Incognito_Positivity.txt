(Oh)  
(Get up face the power)  
(Oh, hey)  
  
It's early in the morning  
The light outside is blinding  
You don't want to know  
You're so tired of complainin'  
'Cause your nine to five ain't workin'  
While your dreams just seem to grow and grow  
  
Nothing's clear  
It's so confusin'  
Intuition's left you  
There's no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go (Don't you know)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Spend the days here waiting  
And all your nights in wishin'  
Seasons come and go  
As you sleep the tide is risin'  
One by one your dreams are drownin'  
While you stare and watch the waters flow  
  
Nothing's clear  
It's so confusin'  
Intuition's left you  
There's no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go (Don't you know)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Don't spend your days  
Watching the way  
(Face the power)  
(Got to please your mind)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity
