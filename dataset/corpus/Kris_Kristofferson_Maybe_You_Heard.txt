Maybe you've heard, your ole buddy's gone crazy  
Searching for words, too deep, sweet reason and rhyme  
Living alone, more and more and he's prone to be lazy  
Turning to stone, blasted and blind.  
Chorus:  
Don't turn away there, hey, goddamn you, he was your brother  
Turn on your father, sister, mother, brother  
He was your friend.  
Don't you condemn him, leave it to strangers  
You ought to know him, give him a hand, if you can  
But at least for jesus christ's sake, understand him.  
Maybe you've heard that they say that the lady's been changing  
Day after day, more than her mind  
Learning to play, where the part has her turning to strangers  
Going too far, line after line.  
Chorus:  
Don't turn away there - hey - goddamn you, you used to love her  
Turn on your father, sister, mother, mister  
She was your friend.  
Don't you condemn her, leave it to strangers  
You ought to know her, give her a hand, if you can  
But at least for jesus christ's sake, understand her.
