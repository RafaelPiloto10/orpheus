Lucky at love  
Well, maybe so  
There's still a lot of things  
You'll never know  
Like why each time  
The sky begins to snow  
You cry  
  
You're faithful to her  
In your careless way  
So you miss her when  
She's far away  
But every time you think  
You've got it straight  
You fall  
  
You face the future  
With a weary past  
Those dreams you banked upon  
Are fading fast  
You know you love her  
But it may not last  
Your fear  
  
It's never easy  
And it's never clear  
Who's to navigate  
And who's to steer  
So you flounder  
Drifting ever near the rocks  
  
It's hard to say  
Where love went wrong  
It's hard to say just when  
It's hard to walk away from love  
It may never come again  
  
You do your best  
To keep your hand in play  
And try to keep  
Those lonesome blues at bay  
You think you're winning  
But it's hard to say sometimes  
  
It's hard to say  
Where love went wrong  
It's hard to say just when  
It's hard to walk away from love  
It may never come again  
  
Lucky at love  
Well, maybe so  
There's still a lot of things  
You'll never know  
Like why each time  
The sky begins to snow  
You cry
