Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
We glide on a magic carpet ride  
All around us stars collide  
And there's poetry inside my head  
It seems I can hear some haunting theme  
Yet there's something in your scheme  
That's too real to be a dream instead!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
The sound all around begins to pound  
An' I know we're homeward bound  
To a world we've often found before  
We climb into space an' out of time  
Then the bells begin to chime  
We're in rhythm and in rhyme, once more!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop...
