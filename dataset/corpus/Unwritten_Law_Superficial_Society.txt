So I'm not good enough  
To hang with your friends  
You say it's a bluff but  
It's no lie  
You want to be cool  
And hang with both side  
But what would they say  
I'm the fool  
  
It's a superficial society  
And it's a bunch of bullshit can't you see  
Why won't you wake up to reality  
I guess backstabbing ain't the way of life for me  
  
Open your mind and close your eyes  
To the things that really persist  
It's not your hair or the things you wear that  
Make someone socially exist  
It's hard to find yourself sometimes  
Around people with a cool policy  
Why don't you let yourself unwind and  
Leave that lame society  
  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Well it's all superficial to me  
Superficial society  
Superficial society
