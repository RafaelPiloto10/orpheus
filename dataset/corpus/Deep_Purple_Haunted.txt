I hear the beating of your wings  
And you're playing on my strings  
In mysterious ways  
You draw me in  
To a love  
Beyond all understanding  
  
Beyond my reach  
So far away  
But it seems  
Like only yesterday  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile  
Then fades away  
  
I hear your footsteps on the ground  
Tempting me to turn around  
It's just the echo  
Of a disenchanted lover  
Shuffling aimlessly  
Homeward bound  
  
To empty rooms  
And picture frames  
And Friends  
Who can't recall our names  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile  
Then fades away
