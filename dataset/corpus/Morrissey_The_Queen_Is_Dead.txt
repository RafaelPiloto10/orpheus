(Take me back to dear old Blighty  
Put me on the train to London Town  
Take me anywhere, drop me anywhere  
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham,  
But I don't care!  
I should like to see my)  
  
(By land, by sea)  
  
Farewell  
To this lands cheerless marches  
Hemmed in like a boar between arches  
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling  
I'm truly sorry  
But it sounds like a wonderful thing  
  
I say Charles, don't you ever crave  
To appear on the front of the Daily mail  
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?  
  
And so,  
I checked all  
The registered historical facts  
And I was shocked into shame to discover  
How I'm the 18th pale descendent  
Of some old queen or other  
Has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Some 9-year old tough peddles drugs  
(I swear to God I swear  
I never even knew what drugs were)  
  
And so, I broke into the Palace  
With a sponge and a rusty spanner  
She said:  
"Eh, I know you  
And you cannot sing"  
I said:  
"that's nothing  
You should hear me play piano"  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But when you're tied  
To your Mother's apron  
No one talks about castration  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
Like love and law and poverty  
These are the things that kill me  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But the rain that flattens my hair  
These are the things that kill me  
(All their lies about make up  
And long hair they're still there)  
  
Passed the Pub who saps your body  
And the church  
Who'll snatch your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Pass the pub that wrecks your body  
And the church  
All they want is your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely
