Get up and jump, get up and jump, get up, get up,get up and jump  
Jump on up  
Jump on down  
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around  
Jump the day away  
Jump all over town  
Cause jumpin' is O.K. in a jumpin' kinda way, hey hey!  
Jump a boy  
Jump a girl  
Jump a rope  
Jump for joy  
Just don't stop jumpin'  
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'  
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?  
When you're just standing or sitting still  
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill  
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos  
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!  
Jump a nun  
Jump a Jack  
Jump for fun  
Jump back  
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?  
And now, it's time for a jump attack  
Get up and jump (x8)  
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie  
To the tune of slima Billy  
Lookin' like you're mighty silly  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?  
Mister Mexican jumpin' bean knows  
His fun is skeaky clean  
Christ, how'd ya think that he got so clean?  
Not from sittin' on his goddamn spleen. Get up!  
Oh, I be jumpin' I be jumpin' I be jumpin' alone  
I be jumpin' for the phone  
I be jumpin' Misses Jones  
I really want to jump on Kinski's bones  
Get up and jump (x8)  
Get up and jump (x8)  
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie  
To the tune of slima Billy  
Lookin' like you're mighty silly  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?
