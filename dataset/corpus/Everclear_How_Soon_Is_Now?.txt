I am the son, I am the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth, how can you say  
I go about things the wrong way  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
I am the son, I am the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I'm the son and heir of nothing in particular  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is a club if you'd like to go  
You could meet someone who really loves you  
So you go and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home and you cry and you want to die
