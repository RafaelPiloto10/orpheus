I can hardly wait to see her coming down the stairs  
A demon's playin' in my head a melody I can't forget  
She's a beauty in her sorrow, each step a falling chord  
That crackles in the giant mirrors at the marble walls  
I feel so different today, I'm ready to explode  
Into kaleidoscopes of strange delight  
Come embrace me, say you'll love me till the very end  
Before I vanish in the shifting sands of time  
Death, the lover  
Death, the lover  
Come embrace  
Say you'll love me  
'Til the very end  
Come, embrace  
'Til the very end of time  
Once I was so sure not knowing  
Leaving traces in the dust  
'Til you said there's nothing new  
Except the things that we forgot  
Here I stand awaiting for a signal from oblivion  
In the twilight of the old uncertainties  
Now she spreads her wings she's comin'  
Like a massive wave of love  
Rolling black as night into my arms  
Now she's comin' in a burning flash of kisses  
Rushing from her lips into the center of my mind.
