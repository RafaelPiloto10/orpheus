I can't see, cause it's burning deep inside.  
Like gasoline, a fire running wild.  
No more fear, cause I'm getting closer now.  
So unreal, but I like it anyhow.  
  
I go faster and faster and faster  
and faster and faster and faster and faster.  
  
I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
And I can't hide from the feeling cause it's right.  
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for love.  
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
  
I can feel that you've mesmerized my heart.  
I feel so free.  
I'm alive, I'm breaking out.  
I won't give in, cause I'm proud of all my scars.  
And I can see I've been wasting too much time.  
I go faster and faster and faster  
and faster and faster and faster and faster.  
  
I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
And I can't hide from the feeling cause it's right.  
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for love.  
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
  
I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
And I can't hide from the feeling cause it's right.  
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for love.  
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies.  
  
A fairytale of lies.
