Chorus  
Mr. politician please don't deceive us.  
Mr. politician you're there to relieve us.  
Just how can we tell, mister,  
When to believe in you.  
  
Oh won't you tell me oh who we're lookin' out for?  
Mr. politician could be perfect but people it's doubtful.  
We want a leader who'll fight for the people.  
We want somebody to take us to the steeple.  
  
We'd like to point him out to you people,  
But don't look now.  
  
Chorus  
  
We want a leader of the people,  
We want him honest, not deceitful.  
We want an angel in the public eye,  
And we won't give it up lord until we die.
