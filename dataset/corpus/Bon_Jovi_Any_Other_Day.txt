Alarm clock rings, 6:45  
Must have hit that snooze button least three times  
Wishing this morning was still last night  
On any other day, just might wanna die  
  
Traffic backed up 20 miles to the east  
Must have hit every damn red light on the street  
Weatherman says "It's gonna rain for a week"  
Hey, what can you do?  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
  
On any other day, I might just stay in bed  
Sit down in a sea of blankets  
Pull them up over my head  
Get your papers in the morning  
Just to get a little edge  
Then maybe just give up in time to do it all again  
  
Hey, I like where this is going  
Yeah, 'cause I know where it's been  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
Yeah, yeah!  
  
Alarm clock rings, 6:45  
I like waking up with you on my mind  
Knowing that you're saving me  
One more time  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
  
Whoa  
Oh yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you
