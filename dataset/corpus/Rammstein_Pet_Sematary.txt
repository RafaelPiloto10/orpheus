Under the arc of the weather stain boards  
Ancient goblins and warlords  
Come out of the ground, not making a sound  
The smell of death is all around  
And the nights come and the cold wind blows  
No one cares and nobody knows  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
I'll follow Victor to a sacred place  
There ain't no dream I can escape  
Molars and fangs and clicking of bones  
Spirits moaning among the tombstones  
When the night has come and the moon is bright  
Someone cries and something ain't right  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
Oh no  
The moon is full, the air is still  
All of a sudden I feel a chill  
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away  
Skeletons dance, I curse this day  
And on the night when the wolves cry out  
Listen close and you can hear me shout  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
Oh no
