(B.Cockburn)  
  
Sun's up, mm, hmm, looks okay  
The world survives into another day  
And I'm thinking about eternity  
And this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Yeah, I had another dream about lions at the door  
They weren't half as frightening as they were before  
I'm thinking about eternity  
Some kind of ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Walls windows trees, waves coming through  
You'll be into me and I'll be into you  
Together in eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Big orange flying boat rises off the lake  
Thousand-year-old dinosaur doing a double take  
Pointing a finger at eternity  
I'm sitting here in the middle of this ecstasy  
Last night again there where lions at the door  
But I wasn't frightened like I was before  
Thinking about eternity  
And the ecstasy that's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin'  
  
[Solo]  
  
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay  
One of these days we're going to sail away  
Sail into eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where they are  
I wanna know  
Where the lions are
