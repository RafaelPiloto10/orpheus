I was standing at the end of my rainbow  
With no where to go and no pot of gold in sight  
All my wishes were way too much to hope for  
But when I saw you I knew I'd seen the light  
  
And not a moment too soon  
With not a minute to spare  
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer  
In my darkest hour  
When my world was filled with gloom  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
  
I used to think that love would never find me  
And the one who cares was lost somewhere in time  
But when you found me I knew I'd found forever  
  
And not a moment too soon  
With not a minute to spare  
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer  
In my darkest hour  
When my world was filled with gloom  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
Not a moment too soon
