Take off your hat, kick off your shoes  
I know you ain't goin' anywhere  
Run 'round the town singin' your blues  
I know you ain't goin' anywhere.  
  
You've always been a good friend of mine,  
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.  
  
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself  
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?  
Put up a fight you believe to be right  
And someday the sun will shine through.  
  
You've always got something to hide  
Something you just can't tell  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.  
  
And I know what you're wishing for  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
  
You've always been a good friend of mine,  
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.
