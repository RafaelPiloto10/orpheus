The night we met I knew I needed you so  
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go  
  
So won't you say you love me  
I'll make you so proud of me  
We'll make them turn their heads  
Every place we go  
  
So won't you be (be my be my baby)  
Be my little baby (my one and only baby)  
Say you'll be my darling (be my be my baby)  
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)  
  
I'll make you happy baby  
Just wait and see  
For every kiss you give me  
I'll give you three  
  
Oh since the day I saw you  
I have been waiting for you  
You know I will adore you  
Till eternity  
  
So won't you please (be by be my baby)  
Be my little baby (my one and only baby)  
Say you'll be my darling (be my be my baby)  
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)  
  
So come on and be (be my be my baby)  
Be my little baby (my one and only darling)  
Say you'll be my darling (be my be my baby)  
Be my baby now  
  
(Be my be my baby)  
Be my little baby (my one and only baby)  
Oh oh oh oh (be my be my baby)  
Oh oh oh oh (my one and only baby)
