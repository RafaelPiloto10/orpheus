First the high then the low  
I'm getting ero-mantic vertigo  
In the rain then the drought  
Oh that's what loving you is all about  
  
Fly, fly into this night  
Oh and rectify my dreams  
I, I love you more than life  
Though seldom I'm serene  
Feel the cold in the heat  
I'm questioning my blind fidelity  
Love is sweet love is tart  
Loving you's a crime when we're apart  
  
Fly, fly into this night  
Oh and steal my fantasies  
I, I love you more than life  
Though seldom I'm at peace
