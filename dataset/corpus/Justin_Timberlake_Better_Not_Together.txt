Love feels lost  
Where is it to be found?  
My heart is still here  
We have to go around and around  
In all the time  
I was loving you faithfully  
And you took my love  
And you turn around on me  
Now I don't wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl back  
Let me work it out for it is over  
What are we doing?  
What can we see to work it out?  
What are we doing?  
Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
It's hard to let go  
Girl we ment through so many things  
But for you to grow, have to go on and spring your wings  
I see your tear, you surce for a pride of day  
You should have hold it through  
When you gave my love away  
Now I don't wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Had to leave it like that, but my thought Imma back  
We tried to work it out  
But it's over  
What are we doing?  
What can we see to work it out?  
What are we doing?  
Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
Girl it's just too much for me to say  
You were tell me that you love me  
And now I watch you walk away  
But girl the way you fight  
It's just the mine  
That's way I spend it this way  
No, what else to say?  
But girl you know that I still love you, yeah  
What are we doing?  
What can we see to work it out?  
What are we doing?  
Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
I realize  
Were just better not together
