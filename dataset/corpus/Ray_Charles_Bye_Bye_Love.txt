Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet happiness, hello emptiness  
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y  
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness  
I feel like I could di-ie  
Bye bye my love goodby-eye  
  
There goes my baby with-a someone new  
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue  
She was my baby till he stepped in  
Goodbye to romance that might have been  
  
CHORUS  
  
I'm-a through with romance, I'm a-through with love  
I'm through with a'countin' the stars above  
And there's the reason that I'm so free  
My lovin' baby is through with me  
  
CHORUS  
  
Bye bye my love goodby-eye  
Bye bye my love goodby-eye  
  
FADE: Bye bye my love goodby-eye  
Bye bye my love goodby-eye
