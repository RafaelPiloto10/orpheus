Why did I show my hand  
Now you know your wish  
Is my command  
I never longed for things I didn't have  
But that's no longer true  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
I know I'm not the same  
I don't need a fortune  
Don't care about fame  
But my soul is a burning flame  
Can't sleep the whole night through  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
I want your sweet caress  
I dream of your tenderness  
Oh I never, ever felt like this  
I swear  
Look what you've done for me  
Oh boy, it's poetry  
When I see the wind in your hair  
  
The tears well up inside  
Oh, what will turn the tide  
And I've been waiting for you to decide  
That you love me too  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
What else could I do  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
You, you, you, you  
On you  
Oh, yeah  
Since I laid eyes  
On you, you, you
