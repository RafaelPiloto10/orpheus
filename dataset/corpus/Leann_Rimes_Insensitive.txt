How do you cool your lips  
After a summer's kiss  
How do you rid the sweat  
After the body bliss  
How do you turn your eyes  
From the romantic glare  
How do you block the sound of a voice  
You'd know anywhere  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I really should have known  
By the time you drove me home  
By the vagueness in your eyes  
Your casual good-byes  
By the chill in your embrace  
The expression on your face  
That told me you might have some advice to give  
On how to be insensitive  
  
How do you numb your skin  
After the warmest touch  
How do you slow your blood  
After the body rush  
How do you free your soul  
After you've found a friend  
How do you teach your heart it's time  
To fall in love again  
  
Oh you probably won't remember me  
It's probably ancient history  
I'm one of the chosen few  
Who went ahead and fell for you  
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch  
I fell too fast, I feel too much  
I thought that you might have some advice to give  
On how to be insensitive  
  
[Chorus]
