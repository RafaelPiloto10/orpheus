Never dreamt I would hope  
While I count the miles  
Through the wind and the rain  
I can see your smile  
There ain't no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Got it in my sight  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There ain't no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Touch it through the night  
Driving into the light  
When I'm on my own  
When I'm all alone  
  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream?  
Is it a dream coming true?  
Meet me halfway  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There are no words to say  
I can see you in the distance  
Hear you through the night  
Ain't no easy way  
When you're on your own  
When you're all alone  
  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream?  
Is it a dream coming true?  
Meet me halfway
