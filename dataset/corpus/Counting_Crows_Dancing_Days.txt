(Original by - Led Zeppelin)  
  
Dancing days are here again  
As the summer evenings grow  
I got my flower, I got my power  
I got a woman who knows.  
Chorus  
  
I said it's alright  
You know it's alright  
I guess it's all in my heart  
  
You'll be my only, my one and only  
Is that the way it should start?  
Crazy ways are evident  
In the way that you're wearing your clothes  
Suppin' boze is precedent  
As the evening starts to glow.  
Chorus  
I told your mamma I'd get you home  
But I didn't tell her I had no car  
I saw a lion he was standing alone  
With a tadpole in a jar.  
Chorus  
Dancing days are here again  
As the summer evening grows  
You are my flower, you are my power  
You are my woman who knows.  
Chorus
