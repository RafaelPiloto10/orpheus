Livin' (livin') is dyin' (dyin') 'cause love you left me cryin'.  
Now there's no use tryin' to go on.  
Each night and day baby.  
Pretendin' there'll be a happy endin'.  
Burning down deep inside.  
Got a heart break that I can't hide.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.  
You're the proud one.  
Believe me.  
This big man is down on his knees.  
Baby please.  
  
Oh baby (baby), remember (baby), when you were warm and tender.  
Beggin' me surrender to your charm.  
You gave me your sweet lips.  
Said use them.  
Oh, why did I abuse them.  
Didn't know good from bad.  
Girl I didn't know what I had.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.  
You're the proud one.  
Believe me.  
This big man is down on his knees.  
Baby please.  
  
Oh baby I love you.  
Please come back.  
I need you.  
I need you.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.
