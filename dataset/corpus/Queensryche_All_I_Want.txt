You mystify with the things that you say.  
You're telling me you're leaving, that you're going away  
To take a trip to find, and leave behind the love.  
  
I've got a destination, a suggestion for you.  
You won't need a jet plane or a luxury cruise.  
Just take a look in my eyes, and realize the love.  
  
I can't live without us,  
So I hope that you will  
Stay with me forever.  
It's all I want from you.  
The thought of our disintegration is killing me.  
I love you.  
  
Living blind without you,  
Don't want to try to live without your love.  
I feel so lonely now with you gone.  
  
But don't take for granted, your condition of me,  
'Cause there'll be retribution, the kind you wouldn't believe  
Let's get back to living, see what tomorrow brings.  
  
Stay with me forever.  
It's all I want from you.  
And if we stay together,  
All our dreams will come true  
  
Stay with me forever.  
It's all I want from you.  
The thought of our disintegration is killing me.  
I love you.
