We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment,  
We are choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside  
This holy reality, this holy experience.  
Choosing to be here in  
  
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion.  
  
Alive, I  
  
In this holy reality, in this holy experience. Choosing to be here in  
  
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion.  
  
Twirling round with this familiar parable.  
Spinning, weaving round each new experience.  
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and
breathing.  
  
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality.  
Embrace this moment. Remember. We are eternal.  
All this pain is an illusion.
