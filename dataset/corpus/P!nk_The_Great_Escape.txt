[Verse 1]  
I can understand how when the edges are rough,  
And they cut you like the tiniest slithers of glass.  
And you feel too much,  
And you don't know how long you're gonna last.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Find a way to make the heart go away.  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Like you're trying to scream underwater.  
  
[Chorus]  
But, I won't let you make the great escape,  
I'm never gonna watch you checkin' out of this place.  
I'm not gonna lose you, cause the passion and the pain,  
Are gonna keep you alive someday.  
Gonna keep you alive someday.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I feel like I could wave my fist in front of your face,  
And you wouldn't flinch or even feel a thing.  
And you've retreated to your silent corner,  
Like you decided the fight was over for ya.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Find a way to make the heart go away.  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Everyone needs a floor they can fall through!  
  
[Chorus]  
I won't let you make the great escape,  
I'm never gonna watch you checkin' outta this place.  
I'm not gonna lose you, cause the passion and pain,  
Are gonna keep you alive someday.  
They're gonna keep you alive someday.  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me,  
And I don't need a pill to make me numb.  
And I wrote the book on runnin',  
But that chapter of my life will soon be done.  
  
[Outro]  
I'm the king of the great escape,  
You're not gonna watch me checkin' outta this place.  
You're not gonna lose me, cause the passion and pain,  
Are gonna keep us alive someday.  
Yeah, the passion and the pain are gonna keep us alive  
Someday, someday.
