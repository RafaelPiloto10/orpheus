Bye bye bluebird, bye bye bluebird  
You were lots of fun to know  
But I have to let you go  
Bye bye bluebird, bye bye bluebird  
You're the flyin' saucer kind  
In and out and hard to find  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
When you came I flipped my lid  
I never thought I'd lose you kid  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Though we were a perfect pair  
It was a flight-by-night affair  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Oh I should have clipped your wings  
I'm not gonna do these things  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
If you ever should be near  
Don't forget to drop in here  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Call me when you're short of dough  
Or maybe just to say hello  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
No hard feelings anyway  
It's nice to know we had our way  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird
