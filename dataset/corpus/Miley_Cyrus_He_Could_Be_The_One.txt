Smooth-talking  
So rocking  
He's got everything that a girl's wantin  
Guitar cutie  
Who plays it groovy  
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid  
  
Think I may be falling for his smile  
Get butterflies when he says my name  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
The way that he's lookin at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me, telling me maybe he could be the
one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat  
  
He's lightning  
Sparks are flying  
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and  
I'm goin' crazy  
About him lately  
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing  
  
Think I'm really digging on his vibe  
He really blows me away!  
  
Woooo!  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
And when he's looking at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's been telling me, telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat  
  
And he's got a way of making me feel  
Like everything I do is  
Perfectly fine  
The stars are aligned when I'm with him  
And I'm so into him...  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
And when he's looking at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's been telling me, telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat
