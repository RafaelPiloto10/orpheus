We're all(we're all) just babies in my veiw  
So crawl baby crawl baby

Miss lady  
You coulda been born a little later but I don't care  
So what if yo head sports a couple of gray hairs  
Same hea and actually I think its funky  
(in a Claire Huxtible type of way)  
Miss lady  
It looks to me like you need a little juice in ya life  
Call me when dat big old house get lonelyfied  
And I'll telleport from here to there  
You show me how its sposed to be done  
I'll make sure you have young fun  
  
Pretty pink baby blue  
Why dont(why dontcha) teach me sumthin new  
We're all(we're all) just babies in my veiw  
So crawl baby crawl baby
