Maybe you'll want to give me kisses sweet  
But only for one night and no repeat  
And maybe you'll go away and never call  
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all  
Oh, little boy!  
  
In that case I don't want nobody  
I do believe that that would only break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me  
If you got the notion  
I second that emotion  
So, if you feel like giving me  
A little time of devotion  
I second that emotion  
  
Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down  
And you don't have the time to hang around  
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools  
And so it makes you wise to break the rules  
Oh, little girl!  
  
In that case I don't want nobody  
I do believe that that would only break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me  
If you got the notion  
I second that emotion  
So, if you feel like giving me  
A little time of devotion  
I second that emotion  
  
In that case I don't want nobody  
I do believe that that would only break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me  
If you got the notion  
I second that emotion
