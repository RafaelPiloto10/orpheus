[Verse 1]  
She said "I know, I know, I know your music  
I prefer your old shit to your new shit  
That song with Pitbull, it was kinda cool  
But after that, you went left and I couldn't fuck with you"  
Well damn, couldn't help but appreciate  
That she was bold enough to say this to my face  
She even went as far to give me her Twitter name  
She said, "I tweeted you and told you the same thing"  
But, she said, "I never thought I'd meet  
And you cuter in real life than on TV  
You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want, what the hell you want with me?"  
  
[Chorus]  
I told her, "Baby, there is a difference  
Between what you really want and what you can get  
I can have anything, but I don't want just anything  
I want you tonight, I want you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said, "You got, you got, you got me twisted  
What my celebrity got to do with it?  
Just cause I can have don't mean I want them chicks  
I take quality over quantity any day, you dig?"  
She said, "I'm hood though, Ne-Yo  
And I know you be on your goody good though, Ne-Yo  
Get ratchet, yes I could, though, Ne-Yo  
Mess up your image, I probably would though, Ne-Yo"  
I said, "You don't scare me  
The word "gentleman" starts with "G""  
She said, "You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want, what you want with me?"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Now that she sat there, lookin' at me like she wasn't sure  
Questionin' my intentions, why and what for  
Thinkin', "He can have actresses, singers or models galore  
I work in a nail shop, every day in that bitch from 8 until 4"  
Shawty's a rose that grows through the cracks in the concrete  
Her mother's body but her brother's knowledge of the street  
Kick all you beautiful lies, shawty ain't goin' for 'em  
She type stubborn, like her daddy, but she don't know him  
Got me feelin' like I ain't good enough  
I ain't a D-boy or a thug so I ain't hood enough  
Or maybe it's the other way around and shawty's self esteem is down  
Not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck, nah mama  
I'm really tryna get to know  
What's under your garden, not just what's under your clothes  
You feel me?  
And don't concern yourself with status, I don't  
It ain't about what I can have, it's about what I want, you dig?  
  
[Chorus]
