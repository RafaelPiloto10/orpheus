I'm growing tired on the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary, far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Days are dark and dreary  
Everywhere I go  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under Heaven's door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
I'm growing tired on the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary, far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Days are dark and dreary  
Everywhere I go  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Mississippi and you
