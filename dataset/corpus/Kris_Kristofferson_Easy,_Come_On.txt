Everybody called the lady Easy  
For the way the lady was to please  
Everybody told her she was crazy  
Lovin' all that love away for free  
  
People hate to see you make it Easy  
They'll never understand  
Some take life for granted  
'Cause it seems to take so long  
Easy takes it any way she can  
  
[Chorus:]  
Easy, come on, take it easy  
Come on, here we go again  
Let it go as easy as you can  
It's the sweetest and the saddest place  
A body's ever been  
Feelin' Easy come and go again  
  
(Easy  
To please  
She was crazy  
And Free)  
  
So let's take our time and make it, Easy  
Bring that bottle from the shelf  
Everybody's laughin' when there's money, love and friends  
When they're gone, the jokes are on yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easy, come on, take it easy  
Come on, here we go again  
Bring us down a bottle from the shelf  
'Cause it's easy come to anyone with money, love and friends  
When they're gone, the jokes are on yourself
