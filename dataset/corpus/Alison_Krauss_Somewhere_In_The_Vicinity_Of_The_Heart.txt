Thousand miles  
Of lonesome highway  
Drinking gallons of coffee in a little cafe  
Brought me here, and it's so good to find there's someone who's got  
The same story as mine  
  
Just look at us, we're a couple hard cases  
So how'd we end up where we are?  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
I don't know where it's callin me  
Well I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
(Alison)  
Been so long  
I can't believe I'd get somethin so sweet  
Where an ache used to be, don't fall  
If love anymore but I'd never met anyone like you before  
Stay here with me for a couple more weeks  
I think there's somethin goin' on  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
Don't know where it's callin me  
I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
(Shenandoah)  
Well it sure took a while to find it  
It's been waiting there all this time  
(Both)  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
(Alison)  
Don't know where it's callin me  
(Shenandoah)  
Well I just know it starts  
(Both)  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
