Such a pretty girl  
The anger didn't hide it  
You shaved your head, pulled a face  
Dressed yourself up without grace  
It didn't hide a life times damage  
It didn't hide a life times fears  
Against your better judgement  
You put your whole self up for sale  
The horror show when you where young  
We couldn't wait to hear about it  
But even whores  
Don't kiss with tongues  
Nonetheless I do believe  
You cry real tears  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
The wrong side of a lifetime's drinking  
It's where it seems I'm coming from  
I took my demons by the hand  
Bent them, twisted them  
Until they scanned and rhymed  
And I took your love  
And all the hurt inside  
Laid it out on the market stall  
Agony at a knockdown price  
Reduced to clear is what I cry  
The wrong side of a lifetime's wishful thinking  
Dragged me here to pills and ale  
Come and listen  
Come and listen to my tale  
Come and get it  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
All the hurt  
All the secrets  
All the damage  
All the shame  
All the dirty absolutions  
All the rage  
All the rage  
All the rage
