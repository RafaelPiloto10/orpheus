Good mornin' dearly beloved  
We are gathered here today  
To watch two people we know  
Make a big mistake  
They'll stand up at the altar  
And solemnly swear "I do"  
They'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new  
  
Her daddy's in the front row  
Mutterin' "Oh no, here we go again"  
They had a couple dates  
Now she's three months late  
And it's twenty bucks a plate I spent, oh  
  
Good mornin' dearly beloved  
I'd like to welcome y'all  
To see the side effects  
Of sex and alcohol  
Please bow your heads and join me  
In a prayer for these two  
Who'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new  
  
The bride is a flirt and the groom is worse  
As he's putting the ring on her  
He's checkin' out the bridesmaids  
Thinkin' that he might take  
The maid of honor's honor, oh  
  
Welcome dearly beloved  
We are here this afternoon  
To throw rice as these two  
Drive down the road to ruin  
With cans tied to the bumper  
And a draggin' muffler too  
They'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new  
  
So raise your glass and join me  
Here's to the bride and groom  
They'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new
