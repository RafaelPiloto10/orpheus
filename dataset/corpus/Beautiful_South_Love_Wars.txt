Love wars, love wars  
Love wars, love wars  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
But it's taking me under  
Since you're not here  
  
Its better when it's hard to get  
But this hide and go seek  
Well, it's making me weep  
  
I promise to stop boxing you 'round  
So don't scratch my face  
End of round eight  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
  
The talks we had don't change a thing  
They only bring rain  
On top of pain  
  
Flash back and uncover tracks  
From when you left  
With my best friend  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't want)  
Love wars  
  
Love bombs explodin' in air  
Until the last one  
I really don't care  
  
I remember losing my head  
And calling you things  
Like dirty names  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't want)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we can't start)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars
