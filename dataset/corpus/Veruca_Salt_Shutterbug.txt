It's freezing in Bristol  
There's love on the tele  
A girl grinning at me  
She's doing the shimmy  
  
And she's cruel  
And she's skinny  
And she's a fool  
For the last living rock king  
  
It's her thrill  
It's her wonder  
It's her will  
It's her way home  
  
She's right where she always wanted to be  
She can't change  
Change...  
Change...  
  
It's lightening in London  
(It's lightening in London)  
Where's shit on the tele  
(there's shit on TV)  
  
You're pushing my buttons  
(pushing my buttons)  
You know how to touch me  
And I knew  
  
That you'd choose me  
By the times  
That you tried to refuse me  
It's your thrill  
  
It's your wonder  
It's your will  
It's your way home  
You're right where you always wanted to be  
  
You can't change  
Change...  
Change...  
(woah)  
  
It's morning in Philly  
(it's morning in Philly)  
My head's feeling heavy  
(my head's feeling heavy)  
  
The sun makes me dizzy  
(the sun makes me sick)  
You monkey, you left me  
And I know  
  
That you miss me  
By the way  
That you kiss and resist me  
It's my thrill  
  
It's my wonder  
It's my will  
It's my way home  
I'm right where I always dreamed I would be  
  
I can't change  
Change...  
Change...  
(woah)
