I wash my hands of this situation,  
Of this complication that you call a relationship.  
Scrub these walls, I might even repaint 'em  
Cause your memory stained them  
And this colour just ain't it  
Scratch that idea, take this mess right here  
Watch it burn, burn  
  
Cause a loss in love is a lesson learned.  
Oh I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,  
Knowing that I don't need you no more.  
I'm so much better for it.  
  
And I'm movin', cleanin' out my closet  
And I'ma get rid of all of this  
All of what you left in here  
Uh, you've been officially evicted  
Cause you just don't get it  
So let me make it nice 'n' clear  
Baby no more games  
Love and respect and truthin'  
You must learn, learn  
  
But a loss in love is a lesson learned.  
Oh I'm so much better for it.  
  
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,  
Knowing that I don't need you no more.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,  
Knowing that I don't need you no more.  
I'm so much better for it.  
  
And I'm better for no longer giving you  
I'm gonna shoot me down out of the blue  
Better for finally realisin' the truth  
That I can do so much better than you  
  
Oh I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,  
Knowing that I don't need you no more.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,  
Knowing that I don't need you no more.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for it.  
I'm so much better for it
