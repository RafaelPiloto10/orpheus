You said you were loving me  
You said I could never see  
The forest for the trees  
Where you're concerned  
  
Just another game you've lost  
And just another stream you'll cross  
And just another bridge  
You'll have to burn  
  
So you're on your way to Texas, girl  
You're Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
You'd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all  
  
But you won't think about me much  
And you won't even miss my touch  
And you won't ever see my face at night  
  
You are so intent on losing  
That's the kind of life you're choosing  
Now you've got me much too weak to fight  
  
So you're on your way to Texas, girl  
You're Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
You'd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all
