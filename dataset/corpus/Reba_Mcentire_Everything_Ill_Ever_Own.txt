Funny you can hold it in your hand  
And never cause you're afraid to play  
And you can feel your dreams  
Softly slipping through your fingers  
Till they're so far away  
  
Sitting there surrounded  
By your many life's possessions  
Feeling so much more than all the load  
You realized you've learned one more  
Of living's many lessons  
Love's worth more than all you'll ever own  
  
[Chorus]  
What I'd give if you were here beside me  
We could spend forever here alone  
Oh what I'd give what would I give  
Just that moment  
Just everything I'll ever own  
  
Funny when I really had it all  
I never knew  
Cause I just couldn't see  
The wealth I hoped to find  
Couldn't even hold a candle  
To the love you gave to me  
  
I've taken love for granted  
And I've taken love for pleasure  
Never taking time to understand  
Now I know that loving you  
Has been my greatest treasure  
And I let it slip right through my hands  
  
[Chorus]
