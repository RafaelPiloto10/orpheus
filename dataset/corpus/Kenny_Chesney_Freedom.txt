People always tell me their life story  
Love they lost, their taste of glory  
He sat next to me at the counter in the diner  
Said I used to be wall street but this is much finer  
  
He had a leather look on a steal horse harley  
A dark eyed girlfriend he called charlie  
He looked a little lost walking out the door  
I think I knew what he was looking for  
  
Freedom, sweet Freedom  
  
I gassed her up climbed back in my cab  
To my wife I'm a husband, to my kids I'm a dad  
To the credit card companies I'm just another sucker  
To the IRS a long hall trucker  
  
Some say that freedoms the power do one pleases  
You can live like the devil or hold on to Jesus  
I found the one thing I was born to do  
Girl that's why I'm running back to you  
  
Freedom, sweet freedom  
  
Oooh,  
He climbed up in my truck with his green duffel bag  
I knew he was a soldier cause I saw his dog tags  
We talked about it  
We cried about it  
Then a steel horse Harley came roaring on past  
I knew it was charlie hangin' on real fast  
We talked about it  
We laughed about it  
  
Through the joy and pain that living brings  
Just know we all own the same thing  
  
Freedom, sweet freedom  
  
Its what the junkie needs that the needle can't give  
Depressed and forgotten are praying for it  
Its what the brave and courageous are fighting for  
An open sail on a distant shore  
  
Freedom
