I always wondered if I could give  
Enough love for a woman to live on  
But as I grow, as I learn and live,  
I find it's best to forget and forgive.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours!  
  
When I was young I was so filled with love,  
Jealousy stung but never deep enough  
'Cause I feel rain falling from above.  
I only thirst for your to share my cup.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours, people. Take me.
