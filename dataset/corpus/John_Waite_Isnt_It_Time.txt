Falling in love was the  
Last thing I had on my mind  
Holding you is a warmth  
That I thought I could never find  
(Sitting here all alone)  
Just trying to decide  
(Whether to go all alone)  
Or stay by your side  
(Then I stop myself because)  
I know I could cry  
I just can't find the answers  
To the questions that keep going through my mind  
Hey babe  
Isn't it time  
(Isn't time it took time to wait)  
(Falling in love could be your mistake)  
Isn't it time  
(Isn't time you took time to wait)  
(Falling in love could be your mistake)  
I've seen visions of someone like you in my life  
A love that's strong reaching out  
Holding me through the darkest night  
(Sitting here all alone)  
Just trying to decide  
(Whether to go all alone)  
Or stay by your side  
(then I stop myself because)  
I don't want to cry  
I just can't find the answers  
To the questions that keep going through my mind  
Hey babe  
Isn't it time  
(Isn't it time it took time to wait)  
(Falling in love could be your mistake)  
(Isn't time you took time to wait)  
(Falling in love could be your mistake)  
(Isn't time you took time to wait)  
(Falling in love could be your mistake)  
I feel a warmth in my heart  
And my soul that I never knew  
This love affair gives me strength  
That I need just to get me through  
(Sitting here all alone)  
Just wondering why  
(Then I stop myself because)  
I know I could cry  
(Then I think of you)  
And everything seems alright  
I've finally found the answers  
To the questions that keep going through my mind  
Hey babe  
Isn't it time  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
(Don't have to wait)  
I know it's time  
Ooh yeah  
I know it's time  
It must be time  
(Don't have to wait)  
(Losing this love could be your mistake)  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
(Don't have to wait)  
It ought a be time  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
It must be time  
(Don't have to wait)  
(Losing this love could be your mistake)  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
(Losin' this love could be your mistake)  
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)  
It ought a be time
