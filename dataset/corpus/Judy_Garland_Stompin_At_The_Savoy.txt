Savoy, the home of sweet romance  
Savoy, it wins you at a glance  
Savoy, give happy feet a chance  
To dance  
  
Your form, just like a clingy vine  
Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine  
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine  
Devine  
  
How my heart is singin'  
While the band is swingin'  
Never tired of rompin'  
Stompin' with you, at the Savoy  
What joy  
  
A perfect holiday  
Savoy, where we can glide and sway  
Savoy, they'll let me stomp away  
With you  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Savoy, Savoy, Savoy,  
Your form, just like a clingy vine  
Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine  
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine  
Devine  
  
Oh, how my heart is singin'  
While the band is swingin'  
Never tired of rompin'  
Stompin' with you, at the Savoy  
What joy  
  
Savoy, Savoy,  
They let me stomp away  
With you
