The hardest thing in the world  
  
Holland it don't please  
I never wanted to leave  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
I'm sick and tired  
It's so obscene  
Will heaven help me be clean?  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
You never heard a word I said  
It's seems simple to me  
That if you knew you wouldn't say  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
And the impression I get  
As the story unfurls  
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
What you feel might not be  
It seems softer to me  
I cannot climb to touch your spire  
I'm getting higher and higher  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
The hardest thing in the world
