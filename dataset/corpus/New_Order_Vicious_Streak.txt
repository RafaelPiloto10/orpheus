  
What am I gonna do ?  
I feel like I'm on fire  
If you only knew  
That you're the object of desire...  
  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that you're the only one  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it won't be long  
  
My aim is true  
My vision is clear  
My thoughts are crude  
Whenever you're near  
  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that you're the only one  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it won't be long  
  
I keep hanging on  
  
You've got a vicious streak  
For someone so young  
You're like solar flare  
In the rising sun  
  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on
