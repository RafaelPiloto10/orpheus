The Devil's Train is long and black  
It rides on rails of fear  
It's headin' for destruction now  
With a drunken engineer  
  
Oh see the greatness of the crowd  
That waits beside the track  
They're leavin' on that Devil's Train  
And never comin' back  
  
Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate  
  
The Devil's Train will take you  
To a land of groans and pain  
You'll spend your days in sorrow  
If you ride that Devil's Train  
  
Oh listen to that whistle scream  
Like echoes from the blue  
The blood is white and spouting steam  
She's on her way to doom  
  
Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate  
  
The Devil's Train is long and black  
It's beautiful to see  
It offers you temptation  
But it gives you misery  
  
So come and ride that glorious train  
Where happiness is free  
It's on its way to heaven now  
To spend eternity  
  
Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate
