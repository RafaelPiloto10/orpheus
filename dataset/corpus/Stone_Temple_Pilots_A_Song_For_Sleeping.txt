Finally I've met you  
The day has come  
You're more than beautiful  
And you're my son  
  
I don't deserve this  
I never thought it could be  
Quite like the moment  
When you first smiled at me  
A toothless, wonderful feeling  
Like I'd never seen  
  
It's you, Noah, it's you  
  
And when you lie down to sleep  
I'll protect you  
From the demons of the night  
While I'm watching you grow  
  
I'll pray  
There's so much I could teach you  
If you only have the time  
Pray  
There's so much God can teach you  
If you only have the time  
  
So will you tell me the little things?  
What does God look like?  
And angels' wings?  
I don't remember these things  
So would you teach them to me?  
So for the moment  
I'll watch you breathe  
  
And when you wake up in the morning  
And I pour the coffee  
You're always smiling, sweetly
