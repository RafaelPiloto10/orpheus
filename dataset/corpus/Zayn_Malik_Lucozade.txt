I'm sipping pink Lucozade  
We're blazing on that new found haze  
I'm seeing in the blacks and grays  
I'm hoping that the basket sways  
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night  
Does that make it right for smoke  
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?  
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear  
  
You don't even wanna know about the things I hear  
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal  
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position  
You'll be fishing for far too long  
You're the bad guy in this movie  
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution  
And the only solution is making shit confusing  
  
Ain't about who's winning or losing  
It's bout the path you're choosing  
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing  
When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising  
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings  
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring  
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality  
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity  
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me  
  
Bullseye, you the dot to me  
Emotions splattered, same pattern, can't even begin to spot 'em  
I'm sad about shit that never happened  
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth  
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out  
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out  
  
She's older, I told her we ain't meant to be  
It takes two not three, but I'm here anyway, I hope he's leaving soon  
Started not to see the elephant in this room, disguise is your perfume  
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind  
You can search the world but you will never find  
I see everything you've done to me, be there, you run to me  
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina  
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya  
Kept runnin', outwit, cause you cunnin'  
That outfit cause you stunnin', begging cause I'm losing mage  
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain  
The fuck is going on? I think I got it wrong  
When I told you I was over you, [?] under me
