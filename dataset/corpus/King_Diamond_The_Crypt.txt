The moon is outside but it can't get in  
Almost dead from his nightly sin  
Jonathan is deep asleep, a perfect time to visit the heap  
  
Down the hallway to the lair, down down the slippery stairs  
Abigail is in the crypt, a lantern in her hand  
  
The secret of the crypt  
A coghing made for a child, wondering who is inside  
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid  
  
The smell is sick  
Mummified in front on its side  
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife  
And it said: Abigail  
  
A silvery necklace was round the mummy's neck  
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge  
"What are you doing here", Henry had come in unseen  
  
Abigail pulled on the necklace and the little mummy's head  
Was separated clean from it's tiny neck  
Then up up up, up into his throat  
Twisting and turning it, oh she couldn't stop  
  
Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood  
He was on the ground  
  
There's an eerie glow in the crypt down below  
Mummified infant on its side  
"Gotta go, gotta run, I'll be back for you little one"  
  
In the crypt Abigail's twin is searching for a home  
Abigail's twin is searching for her Mom  
But Mommy's in the floor and it's made of stone  
Her mommy's in the floor and she doesn't know  
Oh she doesn't know, she doesn't know  
Will she ever know
