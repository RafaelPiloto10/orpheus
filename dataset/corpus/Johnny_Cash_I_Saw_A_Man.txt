Last night I dreamed  
An angel came  
He took my hand  
He called my name  
He bid me look  
The other way  
I saw a man  
I heard him say  
  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then  
I saw the nail-scared hand  
That bled for me  
I touched the hem of his garment  
That fell round him there  
My life, my heart, I gave  
My soul was in his care  
  
When I awoke  
My heart beat so  
And in the dark  
I saw a glow  
This was no dream  
He turned my way  
Again I heard  
My saviour say  
  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then  
I saw the nail-scared hand  
That bled for me  
I touched the hem of his garment  
That fell 'round him there  
My life, my heart, I gave  
My soul was in his care  
(In his care)
