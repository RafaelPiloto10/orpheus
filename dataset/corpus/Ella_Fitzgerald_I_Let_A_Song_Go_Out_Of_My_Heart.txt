I let a song go out of my heart  
It was the sweetest melody  
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song  
  
Since you and I have drifted apart  
Life doesn't mean a thing to me  
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong  
  
Am I too late to make amends?  
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends  
  
I let a song go out of my heart  
Believe me, darlin', when I say  
I won't know sweet music until you return some day  
  
I let a song go out of my heart  
Believe me, darlin', when I say  
I won't know sweet music until you return some day
