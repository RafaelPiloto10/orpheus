What a joy I feel to think about forever  
I'm a child of God  
with blessings from Heaven  
By your side, days always brighter  
The Holy one  
My Master  
My Father  
  
I will dwell in your courts  
I will sing for you  
you're my deepest love  
Jesus  
I love you  
  
It's a love song I sing  
It's an anthem from my heart  
All praises to the King  
  
I am not alone  
Jesus  
You're near me  
Washed me clean with hands full of mercy  
You're a resting place for all who are weary  
A perfect place  
and a new beginning
