The urge to take you grows more strong  
For time had made me wait too long  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twenty-five o'clock - that's when you're going to be mine  
Twenty-five o'clock, we'll be together till the end of time  
At twenty-five o'clock  
  
The ticking seconds - hear them call  
My spell of hours will make you fall  
Each timer that I break  
Will halt the flowing sands  
Each timer that I break  
Will put you in my hands  
At twenty-five o'clock - that's when you're going to be mine  
Twenty-five o'clock, we'll be together till the end of time  
At twenty-five o'clock  
  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twenty-five o'clock
