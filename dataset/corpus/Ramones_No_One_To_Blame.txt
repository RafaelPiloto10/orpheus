I'm not lookin' for a friend  
I don't have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I don't take no sympathy  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
Well there's no more loyalty  
Somebody always tryin' to complain  
I don't need no one to blame  
It's a bad, bad, bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
I needed just one break it never came  
I kept my cool  
I ain't the same  
I had a lot of drinks and fun  
It just made me sleepy  
There's not much that I want to say  
I never said I am sorry  
It's a bad, bad, bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
On weekends if it decides to rain  
I watch my friends go down the drain  
I'm not looking for a friend  
I don't have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I don't take no sympathy
