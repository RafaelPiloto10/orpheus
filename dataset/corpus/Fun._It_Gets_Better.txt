What've we done?  
Oh my God  
What've we done?  
Oh my God  
  
This is really happening  
You've never looked so bored  
Can you feel my fingernails?  
They've never been so short  
  
It's hard to lay a golden egg  
With everyone around  
It's hard to stay inside my head  
When words keep pouring out  
  
Like starlight crashing through the room  
We'll lose our feathers  
Yes, I know it hurts at first  
But it gets better  
  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
  
I can taste your summer sweat  
It's never been so warm  
So can we kick the covers off?  
They're always on  
It's never been so warm  
  
It's hard to keep a straight face  
When I just want to smile  
Wish you could see the look that's in your eyes  
  
Like starlight crashing through the room  
We'll lose our feathers  
Yes, I know it hurts at first  
But it gets better  
  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
  
There's a fire in sky  
Some snow in the ground  
Not quite enough cigarettes  
To calm me down  
  
Oh my God  
What've we done?  
Oh my God  
What've we done?  
Oh my God  
  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
It gets better  
We'll get better  
  
This is really happening  
This is really happening
