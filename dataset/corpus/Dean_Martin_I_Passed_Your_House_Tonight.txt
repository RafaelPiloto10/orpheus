I passed your house tonight  
And I stood outside  
I passed your house tonight  
And I almost cried  
  
Oh how I missed seeing you waiting at the door for me  
And wondered if your heart asked anymore for me  
Then all at once I knew  
You no longer cared  
  
I saw two silhouettes in the window there  
Two silhouettes in the window that kissed by candle light  
And so I passed your house tonight  
Two silhouettes in the window that kissed by candle light  
And so I passed your house tonight
