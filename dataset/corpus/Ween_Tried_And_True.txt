At the dawn, I woke, I was alone, rising  
I called you on, the force, of time and space, calling  
And as she came, to me, I fell back down, realizing  
Oh that it's cool, for you, to love me now, I'm everything  
  
Everything, 'cause tried, and true, I see the light in you  
Oh han you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?  
  
You bent the edge, eclipsed, and turned around, aligning  
And though the dark, sparked rays of violet light, blinding  
I went about, the job, of sowing thoughts, and feelings  
Oh some were good, some bad, I felt the cries, of healing  
  
'Cause tried and true, I see the light in you  
Oh can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?  
  
Rise, my Dawn, you've been awake too long  
Let me rest in time, while I blow your mind  
  
At the dawn, I woke, I was alone, rising (I got ya)  
I called you on, the force, of time and space, calling (see them)  
And as she came, to me, I fell back down, realizing (creation)  
that it's cool, for you, to love me now, I'm everything (I am)  
  
Everything,'cause tried and true, I see the light in you  
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?
