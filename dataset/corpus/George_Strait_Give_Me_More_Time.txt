A banker and a farmer discuss the bottom line,  
It ain't rained and all the crops are dying on the vine.  
Give me more time.  
You gotta give me more time.  
That farm's been in my family going on a hundred years.  
We've pulled through hard times before with blood sweat and tears.  
Give me more time,  
I need more time.  
Oh, what would he give for a little more time?  
  
Two lovers at a table candlelight and wine,  
One's looking for an answer the other one can't find.  
Give me more time, You gotta give me more time.  
She says "You know I love you but my heart's in a bind,  
Afraid you?re gonna leave me if I don't make up my mind."  
Give me more time, I gotta have more time.  
Some have barely any, some too much on their hands.  
Some would give anything to have it back again.  
  
A patient and his doctor meet behind closed doors,  
You kidding me? How could this be, I'm only 24. Give me more time,  
You gotta give me more time, give me more time.
