Fearlessness blew in with the wind  
Waking up to greet the sun  
We sailed on like the ancient ones  
Into the night underworld  
We knew dangers would come  
I had faith in both of us  
  
Listen to your heart  
(You can hear me)  
Listen to your heart  
(You can hear me)  
  
Day turned night when he questioned  
Why can't you balance the sky?  
Soulless storms have sent watchers  
With bladeless weapons to fight  
  
Teams of horses of the brine  
Followed his cries through the fire  
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind  
Did you listen?  
  
Listen to your heart  
(Can you hear me?)  
Listen to your heart  
(Can you hear me?)  
  
Fearlessness soon reminded me  
You must be stronger then they  
Cautioning there those who live  
To be cruel for the fun of it  
  
He let in a dark companion  
That orbited between us  
His siren friends convinced him that love  
Was no match against storms to come  
Their songs inflamed by doubt  
Fearlessness drowned them out  
  
Teams of horses of the brine  
Followed his cries through the fire  
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind  
Did you listen?  
  
Listen to your heart  
Can you hear me?  
Listen to your heart  
Can you hear me?  
  
Did we begin without knowing it?  
To find fault in every gift  
Then that was when the blame began  
What were once two forces joined  
In fearlessness
