Don't talk back to me, don't talk back to me  
Don't talk back to me, don't talk  
  
Going round in circles, hearing too many points of view  
Just words to tire me out, small talk I could do without  
I would be amazed if you returned to see things my way  
Now that you've been disrespectful to my sense of pride  
  
Isn't it a shame that you were lying when you said to me (small talk)  
I was the only one, you and I were meant to be  
I expect you'll never really feel the way that I do  
All of this is with regret, I'm sure you will agree  
  
Say something to me, anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
I've seen all I want to see, and you mean the world to me  
I've lived for each moment to be with you, with you, with you  
  
Small talk, small talk, small talk, small talk  
  
You say I don't talk enough, that applies to both of us  
Don't try to sound me out, something I could do without  
So much goes on inside your head, I often wonder  
Have you heard enough to know, there's nothing left to say  
  
Say something to me, anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
I've seen all I want to see, and you mean the world to me  
I've lived for each moment to be with you, with you, with you  
  
Small talk  
Small talk  
Ooh small talk  
That's all I ever hear  
Small talk  
  
I'll be alright  
It may take sometime  
But I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(don't want to be alone, nothing worth to carry on)  
  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(try hard to understand, you won't seem to lend a hand)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(without you'll fail to see, you never spare a thought for me)  
  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(so many things you said, going round in circles)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(I'll rise above it all, enough to see another day)  
  
I'll be alright  
I'll be alright  
Don't talk back to me...
