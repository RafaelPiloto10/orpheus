I thought I'd write to Juliet's, for she would understand  
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down  
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend  
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,  
To welcome death  
  
For I received a letter that is worth reporting  
And though it may raise a cynical smile  
It leaves a sinking feeling  
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...  
"Have you seen my pride and joy?..."  
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...  
"This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.  
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet  
And I was thinking if something you said..."  
  
"I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.  
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college  
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive  
I imagine I may think again..."  
  
"I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack  
Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have  
Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask  
I don't know why I am writing to you"
