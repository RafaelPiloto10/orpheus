Amanda don't you know  
That I still walk around  
This foggy round about  
When I get back in town.  
I was a different man  
From five seconds ago  
And you're a different woman,  
That's for certain,  
I don't know a thing about.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.  
  
Amanda don't you know  
I wasn't strong enough  
And in your wild mind  
I wasn't smart enough.  
I was a different kid  
From fifteen years ago  
And you're a different woman,  
That's for certain,  
I wanna know about.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.  
  
I'm not playin' with your mind  
Unless you think I am.  
'Cause you're crushing my heart  
Like a battering ram.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.
