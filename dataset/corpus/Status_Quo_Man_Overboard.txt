There's a hole in my bed where I ain't seen you for days  
Got a pain in my head ''cause I'm back to my bad old ways  
I can't get out, you won't come in  
And you can't see the state I'm in  
On top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Everyday I'm a-wasting away, it's oh so bad  
My mind's gone dead and my eyes are red, it's oh so sad  
Nobody calls, they've had enough  
I've got to stop myself drinking this stuff  
On top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown  
Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around  
  
Save my soul, I said save my soul  
Oh save my soul, I'm losing my grip  
I think I'm gonna slip, oh  
  
I gotta do something or I might as well be living in hell  
I gotta find someone who can break me away from this spell  
It's getting to me, it's bringing me down  
I'm cold and I'm lonely since you ain't around  
And on top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown  
Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around  
  
Save my soul, save my soul  
Save my soul, I'm losing my grip  
I think I'm gonna slip, oh
