Goodbye Betsy I'm goin' away  
I'm sick of you and there ain't no way  
don't want to know, don't want to see  
don't you ever bother me  
Sick of hanging around your pad  
Sick of your Mom and sick of your Dad  
Yeah and Betsy,  
its sad but true,  
now I'm even sick of you.  
No way, no way, no way  
No way, no way, no way  
No way, for our love  
No way for our love  
'cause I'm sick of You.  
Good bye Betsy I'm going away.  
Sick of you and i don't want to stay  
don't want to know, don't want to see  
don't you ever bother me  
Sick of hanging around your pad  
Sick of your mom and sick of your Dad  
Yes and Betsy its sad but true  
Now I'm even sick of you.  
No way, no way, no way  
No way, no way, no way  
No way, for our love,  
No way for our love  
'cause I'm sick of you  
Every evening and every day,  
Seem to always turn out this way,  
To get an end  
I better find new love,  
then you'll pay,  
then you'll pay,  
ain't no way.  
'cause I'm sick of you.  
Goodbye Betsy I'm going away,  
Sick of you and i don't want to stay  
don't want to know , don't want to see  
don't you ever, bother me ....
