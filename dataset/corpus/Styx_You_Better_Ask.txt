I met a little girl sitting in the front  
Pardon me miss for seeming quite so blunt  
But your beauty and your presence  
Just took me by surprise  
  
She said there's a meaning in my sexy stare  
But that's my old man that's sitting over there  
And that's not the look of love that he's got for you in his eyes  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
I took her home and we was doing nip and tuck  
How was I to know that I was out of luck  
And before I knew it, the devil took my soul  
  
In two weeks time it seemed to be the steady con  
She told me "you're about to be a papa, John"  
And I just looked around and tried to crawl into the nearest hole  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
Well, in two more weeks I started feeling sore  
I found myself waiting at my doctor's door  
He said, "son I'm sorry but I've got some slightly less than tragic news  
  
"yeah, it seems you've been sociable with certain she's  
Cause you've contracted what we call a social disease  
And next time you better ask and use it, no don't refuse"  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask
