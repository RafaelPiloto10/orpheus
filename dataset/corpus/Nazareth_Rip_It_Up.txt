My head is dancin' like a ball full of fire  
Burnin' up with the flames gettin' higher  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like you know you really should  
  
We never have to say a thing to one another  
The band is hot 'n' there playing it like a mother  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound, catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Sweet is drippin' from the ceiling an' the walls  
Word is out.I hear the curtains gonna fall  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound, catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound,catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Ooh, rip it up, rip it up (rip it up)  
Ooh, rip it up, rip it up (rip it up,rip it up)
