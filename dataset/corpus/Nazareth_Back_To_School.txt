You didn't listen when you went to school  
You dressed like a clown and you behaved like a fool  
But now your education is about to begin  
The difference between love and the mess that you're in  
You figured you're cool I'll bend all the rules  
I'll get them going red flags to a bull  
It's not like the movies no duel in the sun  
You need the answer to get your love done  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
You know the business or so you believe  
You set all your sights but you aim to deceive  
You think you'll hit the target every time that you fire  
You think you know the difference between love and desire  
But someone's waiting to turn you around  
She'll shoot you down and put your feet on the ground  
It's not like dreamin' you can make mistakes  
A lesson learned is not so easy to take  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
You're doin' numbers but you don't keep the score  
They're scratchin' the surface but they don't  
Reach the core  
You only bought the ticket 'cause the price was "all in"  
You'll never reach the heart until you've broken the skin  
You're busy running but you never relax  
Live now pay later including the tax  
But now your education is about to begin  
Forget about the stories and the places you've been  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
Back to school back to school
