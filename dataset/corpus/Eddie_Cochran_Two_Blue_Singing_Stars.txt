There's two blue singin' stars in heaven  
I see and hear them every night  
They used to sing and shine here on earth  
So beautiful and bright  
One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame  
The other blue star is from Alabama  
Oh I need not call his name  
They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home  
They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne  
So when our life on earth is over  
And we turn it to the stars  
We'll meet our friends that sing and play  
Those golden blue guitars  
  
There's two blue singin' stars in heaven  
I see and hear them every night  
Singin' songs coming from their hearts  
To fill mine with delight  
One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame  
The other blue star is from Alabama  
I need not call his name  
They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home  
They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne  
Someday there'll be a grand reunion  
It'll be a heavenly affair  
When we pass through those pearly gates  
And meet our friends up ther
