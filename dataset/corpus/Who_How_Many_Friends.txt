I'm feelin' so good right now  
There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past  
He buys me a brandy  
But could it be he's really just after my ass?  
  
He likes the clothes I wear  
He says he likes a man who's dressed in season  
But no-one else ever stares, he's being so kind  
What's the reason?  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
You can count 'em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
Suddenly it's the silver screen  
And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out  
Everybody hears me  
But I look like a fool now  
With a cry and I shy out  
She knows all of my friends  
But it's nice to find a woman who's keen on living  
Now I think I've reached the end  
I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate?  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
It's all like a dream you know  
When you're still up early in the morning  
And you all sit together to watch the 1 come through  
But things don't look so good  
When you could use a bit of warning  
Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
When I first signed a contract  
It was more than a handshake then  
I know it still is  
But there's a plain fact  
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs  
I get the willies  
People know nothing about their own soft gut  
So how come they can sum us up  
Without suffering all the hype we've known  
How come they bum us up  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
You can count 'em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?
