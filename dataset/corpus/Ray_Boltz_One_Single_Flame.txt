In the heart of the believer  
Burns a fire for the soul  
To light the way  
And fight against the cold  
But if we all would gather  
Joining hearts in one accord  
The blaze would rise much higher  
United in the Lord  
  
[CHORUS:]  
One single flame  
An everlasting light  
Shining through the darkness  
Shattering the night  
A healing fire  
Lifting up the Saviors name  
May a world of true believers  
Burn one single flame  
  
Sometimes we put up boundaries  
With traditions from the past  
Its hard to move forward looking back  
For the Fathers kingdom  
We must set aside these walls  
Standing undivided  
Let us rise up for his call  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
Today and for the future  
Its burning brighter than before  
To those who come behind us  
Let us pass the torch  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]
