Once, we were together  
Once we were one  
Once we were running, we knew where we came from  
We were the music, we heard the call  
We were giants after the fall  
Once we were children, once we were so small  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
  
Once, we were divided, once, we lost our sight  
Once, we were freezing in the tv light  
You are a rainbow, you're looking fine  
Shall we make it one more time  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
You are a rainbow
