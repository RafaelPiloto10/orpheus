The sun is high up in the sky and I'm in my car  
Drifting down into the abattoir  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath  
Entwined together in this culture of death  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze  
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory  
Can you hear what I hear, babe?  
Does it make you feel afraid?  
  
Everything's dissolving, babe, according to plan  
The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land  
I went to bed last night and my  
Moral code got jammed  
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand  
  
I kissed you once. I kissed you again  
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange  
Do you feel what I feel, dear?  
  
Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy  
These things are not good for me  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The line the God throws down to you and me  
Makes a pleasing geometry  
Shall we leave this place now, dear?  
Is there someway out of here?  
  
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work  
The need for validation, babe, gone completely  
Berserk  
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a  
Jerk  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
Right down to my shoes
