Oh Carol I Am But a Fool  
Darling I Love Though You Treat Me Cruel  
You Hurt Me And You Make Me Cry  
But If You Leave Me  
I Will Surely Die  
  
Darling There Will Never Be Another  
'Cause I Love You So  
Don't Ever Leave Me  
Say You'll Never Go  
I Will Always Want  
You For My Sweet Heart  
No Matter What You Do  
Oh Carol I'm Still In Love With You  
  
Oh Carol I Am But a Fool
