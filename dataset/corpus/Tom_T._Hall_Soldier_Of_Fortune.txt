I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
I'd rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
It's my turn to try  
So I'll take my best hold  
I've done my time in the beer and wine mines  
Tryin' to climb with my own kind of rhymes  
It ain't easy  
I've had my doubts what they're mostly about  
Whether I should reach out to the crowd  
To just try to please me  
Chasin' the brass rein and bendin' guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
(I'll follow my dreams)  
I already know, it's a rough row to hoe  
But I can't let go  
I've been almost so close a few times  
My sights are all set, it's my chance to get  
Somethin' better than whatever  
It is that I'm leavin' behind  
Chasin' the brass rein and bendin' guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
I'd rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
It's my turn to try  
So I'll take my best hold  
I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune
