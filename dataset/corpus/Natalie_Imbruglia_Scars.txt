Is this part, is this part of the process, of the process  
Cannot find another way round, other way round, round the pain  
'Cause you left me here in the middle of it  
Said I'm working out I promise  
I don't know how we got here in the first place  
  
I climb the walls, you hit the bars  
I've ever been is you run for miles  
You got your brand new friend and I got a broken heart  
Doesn't matter who we are  
Everyone has their scars  
Everyone has their scars  
  
There's a place, there's a place that I'm heading, that I'm heading  
Need to know are you coming, are you coming there with me  
'Cause you're heading in the wrong direction  
Just as I need your protection  
Maybe I should let you find your own way  
  
I climb the walls, you hit the bars  
I've ever been is you run for miles  
You got your brand new friend and I got a broken heart  
Doesn't matter who we are  
Everyone has their scars  
Everyone has their scars  
  
What could be so bad  
It's taken you so far  
Until you don't know who you are  
  
I climb the walls, you hit the bars  
I've ever been is you run for miles  
You got your brand new friend and I got a broken heart  
Doesn't matter who we are  
Everyone has their scars  
I climb the walls, you hit the bars  
I've ever been is you run for miles  
You got your brand new friend and I got a broken heart  
Doesn't matter who we are  
Everyone has their scars  
Everyone has their scars  
Everyone has their scars
