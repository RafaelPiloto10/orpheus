Everytime I look into the mirror  
I swear that I don't see the things you do  
You say it couldn't be any clearer  
And all I can see is me without you  
  
[Chorus]  
Without you trying to change me  
With you trying to take me  
And turn me into someone you once knew  
Without you trying to make me  
Without you trying to break me  
  
All I can see is me without you  
When you slipped that little ring around my finger  
you smiled and said your wilder days are through  
Well, I've got a real bad case of rambling fever  
And all I can see is me without you  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
All I can see is me without you
