So long sitting here,  
Didn't hear the warning.  
Waiting for the tape to run.  
We've been moving around in different situations,  
Knowing that the time would come.  
Just to see you torn apart,  
Witness to your empty heart.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Through the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in  
At her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo.  
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument  
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body.  
She shuddered  
Instinctively.  
No life at all in the house of dolls.  
No love lost.  
No love lost.  
  
You've been seeing things,  
In darkness, not in learning,  
Hoping that the truth will pass.  
No life underground, wasting never changing,  
Wishing that this day won't last.  
To never see you show your age,  
To watch until the beauty fades,  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Two-way mirror in the hall,  
They like to watch everything you do,  
Transmitters hidden in the walls,  
So they know everything you say is true,  
Turn it on,  
Don't turn it on,  
Turn it on.
