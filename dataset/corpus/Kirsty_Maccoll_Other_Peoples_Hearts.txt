I'm staying home this evening  
And playing my guitar  
And all the time I'm strumming  
I'm wondering where you are  
Oh yes I know it's over  
I know I shouldn't care  
But I can't get away from you  
It seems you're always there  
How come I don't see you anymore?  
How come we lost the magic touch?  
Why can't I pick up the telephone  
When I want to call you so much?  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't still breaking mine  
The winter's drawing in again  
Another year has passed  
Now I think of things I meant to say  
But the time went by so fast  
I hear you're living in new york these days  
And you don't come here any more  
I keep asking myself so many questions  
But lately I wonder what I'm wondering for  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't still breaking mine  
I let you pass me by  
I never tried too hard  
Though you'll never see me cry  
You really made your mark  
How come I don't see you anymore?  
How come we lost the magic touch?  
And why can't I pick up the telephone  
When I want to hear your voice so much?  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't  
If you weren't still breaking mine
