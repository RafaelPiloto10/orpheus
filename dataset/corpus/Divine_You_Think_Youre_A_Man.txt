Turn around, stand up like a man and look me in the eye  
Turn around, take one final look at what you've left behind  
Then walk away from the greatest lover you have ever known  
Yes walk away, you're telling me that you can make it on your own  
By yourself, all alone, without my help  
Mister you just made a big mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
You think you're a man but you're only a boy  
You think you're a man but you're only a toy  
You think you're a man but you just couldn't see  
You weren't man enough to safisfy me.  
Shut the door, take a look around and tell me what you find  
  
Shut the door, take a giant step for you and all mankind  
Then don't come back, I always gave you so much more than you deserve  
No, don't come back 'cause no one makes a fool of me  
You've got a nerve to walk away, mark the words I'm gonna say  
Mister you just made a big mistake.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shut the door, take a giant step for you and all mankind  
Then don't come back, I always gave you so much more than you deserve  
No, don't come back 'cause no one makes a fool of me  
You've got a nerve to walk away, mark the words I'm gonna say  
Mister you just made a big mistake.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
