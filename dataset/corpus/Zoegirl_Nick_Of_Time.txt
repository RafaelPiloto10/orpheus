I led a lonesome journey  
Full of disdain and fury  
I kept my angered yearning  
Close to me like fire burning  
I watched a million chances  
Slip through my weathered hands  
I almost lost myself when I looked around  
There was nobody else  
[Chorus:]  
In the nick of time  
You opened up my mind  
And suddenly I saw the world much clearer  
In the nick of time  
You turned my water to wine  
And suddenly I didn't feel the fear  
Right before my eyes  
You showed me there was life that to be found  
You're the miracle I prayed about you  
You were the one to save my life  
In the nick of time  
I followed habits around  
Been swept above off the clouds  
But fallen down left shaken  
Abandened by the pills I'd taken  
I could have kept on going  
With no one ever knowing  
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I could not, I could not believe  
That you were right there waiting  
I never, no, I never dreamed  
That you'd be right there waiting  
Oh you were there for me  
And when I couldn't see,  
I couldn't, no, I couldn't see  
You showed me life [2x]  
LIFE [3x]  
[Chorus (2x)]
