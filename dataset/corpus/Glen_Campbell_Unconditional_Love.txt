Here's to the people who gave me life  
And then showed me how to live it  
And taught me that you measure love  
By how freely you can give it  
  
And the gift I give to you  
Is the lesson that I learned  
That when a love is true  
It has nothing in return  
  
Unconditional love, that they gave to me  
It wasn't mine to keep and I knew someday  
I'd hand it down to you and hope that I can be  
The one who makes you see  
The importance of unconditional love  
  
And there were times I know I let them down  
But never once was I rejected  
And when I stood alone to face this world  
Somehow I still felt protected  
  
That's the common bond we share  
And it will last through the years  
And you can trust that I'll be there  
Through the good times and the tears  
  
Unconditional love, like they gave to me  
It's not yours to keep and I know someday  
Someone will look to you and you will have to be  
The one who makes him see  
The importance of unconditional love
