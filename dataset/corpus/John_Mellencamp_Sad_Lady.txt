Written by John Mellencamp and George Green  
  
Oh Sad Lady do you curse your name  
And how many times have you been ashamed  
Crazy Lady letting your emotions show  
It's hard being a woman knowing what you know  
  
Oh Sad Lady were you born in vain  
Nothing to live for and no one to blame  
Ain't no use in screaming or pulling on your hair  
Crazy Lady dancing with a chair  
  
(1st bridge)  
  
Oh oh if you should get to know  
Sad Lady  
Say maybe  
  
Oh Sad Lady won't you dry your eyes  
You go on living wishing you could die  
'cause dying's not bad when living's not so good  
Crazy Lady so misunderstood  
  
(repeat 1st bridge)  
  
(2nd bridge)  
Tell me what you're thinking  
As you lace up white shoes  
Tell me Sad Lady
