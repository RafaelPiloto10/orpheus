There's a place in the world for the angry young man  
With his working class ties and his radical plans  
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl  
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.  
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost  
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  
  
Give a moment or two to the angry young man  
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood  
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good  
He sits in a room with a lock on the door  
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  
  
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage,  
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight  
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view  
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right.  
  
And there's always a place for the angry young man  
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  
He's never been able to learn from mistakes  
He can't understand why his heart always breaks  
He's honest and pure and has courage as well  
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell  
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.
