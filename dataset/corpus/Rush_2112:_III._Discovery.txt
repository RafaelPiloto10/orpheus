Iii. Discovery  
Words by Neil Peart, Music by Alex Lifeson  
  
... "Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was  
Hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the  
Dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in  
My hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was  
Beautiful"...  
... "I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn  
The keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the  
Wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious  
Sounds, and soon my own music! How different it could  
Be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the  
Priests about it! ... "  
  
What can this strange device be?  
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound  
It's got wires that vibrate and give music  
What can this thing be that I found?  
  
See how it sings like a sad heart  
And joyously screams out its pain  
Sounds that build high like a mountain  
Or notes that fall gently like rain  
  
I can't wait to share this new wonder  
The people will all see its light  
Let them all make their own music  
The Priests praise my name on this night
