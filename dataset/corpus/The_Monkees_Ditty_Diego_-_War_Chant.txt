Well?  
Are you kidding? ha ha!  
Hey, now, wait a minute!  
  
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees  
You know we love to please  
A manufactured image  
With no philosophies  
  
We hope you like our story  
Although there isn't one  
That is to say, there's many  
That way there is more fun  
  
You told us you like action  
And games of many kinds  
You like to dance, we like to sing  
So let's all lose our minds  
  
We know it doesn't matter  
'cause what you came to see  
Is what we'd love to give you  
And give it one, two, three  
  
But it may come three, two, one, two  
Or jump from nine to five  
And when you see the end in sight  
The beginning may arrive  
  
For those who look for meanings  
In form as they do fact  
We might tell you one thing  
But we'd only take it back  
  
Not back like in a box, back  
Not back like in a race  
Not back so we can keep it  
But back in time and space  
  
You say we're manufactured  
To that we all agree  
So make your choice and we'll rejoice  
In never being free  
  
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees  
We've said it all before  
The money's in, we're made of tin  
We're here to give you more  
  
We want the Monkees  
  
Give me a "w"  
Give me an "a"  
Give me an "r"  
What does it spell?
