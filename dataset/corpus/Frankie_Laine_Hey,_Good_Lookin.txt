Hey good looking.  
Hey good looking what you got cooking  
How's about cooking something up for me  
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe  
We could find us a brand new recipe  
  
I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill  
And I know a spot right over the hill  
The juke box's jumping the dance is free  
So if you want to have fun come along with me  
  
Hey good looking what you got cooking  
How's about cooking something up for me  
  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about saving all your time for me  
No more looking, I know I've been cooking  
How's about keeping steady company  
  
I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence  
And find me one for five or ten cents  
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age  
''cause I'm writing your name down in every page.  
  
Chorus
