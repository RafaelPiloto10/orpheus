Come out come out  
No use in hiding  
Come out come out  
Can you not see  
There's no place here  
What were you expecting  
No room for both  
Just room for me  
So you lay your arms down  
Yes I will call this home  
  
Away away  
You have been banished  
Your land is gone and given me  
And here I will spread my wings  
Yes I will call this home  
What's this you say  
You feel the right to remain  
Then stay and I will bury you  
What's that you say  
Your father's spirit still lives in this place  
I will silence you  
  
Here's the hitch  
Your horse is leaving  
Don't miss the boat  
It's leaving now  
And as you go I will spread my wings  
Yes I will call this home  
I have no time to justify to you  
Fool you're blind, move aside from me  
All I can say to you my new neighbor  
Is you must move on or I will bury you  
  
Now as I rest my feet by this fire  
Those hands once warmed here  
I have retired them  
I can breathe my own air  
And I can sleep more soundly  
Upon these poor souls  
I'll build heaven and call it home  
  
Cause you're all dead now  
I live with my justice  
I live with my greedy need  
I live with no mercy  
I live with my frenzied feeding  
I live with my hatred  
I live with my jealousy  
I live with the notion  
That I don't need anyone but me  
Don't drink the water  
There's blood in the water.
