You come home late from work, baby  
You wonder why it ain't on the table  
After the day that I've had  
I don't believe I'm able  
You give me every little reason in the book  
But there's one thing that I think you've overlooked  
You say you're tired, well so am I  
Baby you've got to try and  
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby  
Meet halfway if you want to get it right  
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby  
Meet halfway in the middle of the night  
Our love is kind of stalled, baby  
  
But it ain't about the sex  
I'd trade the roses and the negligees  
If we could just connect  
I go deeper when you look into my eyes  
There's a place where neither one of us can hide  
And it's up to us to reinvent the game  
Love it when you call my name and  
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby  
Meet halfway, and we're halfway home  
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby  
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone
