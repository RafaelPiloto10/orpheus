When you're sad and when you're lonely  
And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And all that you held sacred  
Falls down and does not mend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When you're standing on the crossroad  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When the storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And there is no-one there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
For the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Up in dark and empty skies  
Where the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And you search in vain to find  
Some law-abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end
