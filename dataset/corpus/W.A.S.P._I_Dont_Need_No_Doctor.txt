I don't need no doctor  
'Cause I know what's ailing me  
I don't need no doctor  
'Cause I know what's ailing me (yes, I do)  
All I need is my baby  
You don't know I'm in misery  
  
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor  
My prescription tells me that  
I don't need no doctor

Ooh - yeah, my motion, oh yeah, no

I don't need no doctor  
I don't need no doctor  
I don't need no doctor  
I don't need no doctor  
  
I don't need no doctor
