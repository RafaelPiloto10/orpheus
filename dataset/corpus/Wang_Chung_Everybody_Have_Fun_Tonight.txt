I'll drive a million miles  
To be with you tonight  
So if you're feeling low  
Turn up your radio  
The words we use are strong  
They make reality  
But now the music's on  
Oh baby dance with me yeah.  
  
Rip it up  
Move down  
Rip it up  
Move it down to the ground  
Rip it up  
Cool down  
  
And get the feeling not the word.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
Ev'rybody Wang Chung tonight  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
Ev'rybody Wang Chung tonight  
Ev'rybody have fun  
  
Deep in the world tonight  
Our hearts beat safe and sound  
I'll hold you so close  
Just let yourself go down  
  
Rip it up  
Move down  
Rip it up  
Move it down to the ground  
Rip it up  
Cool down  
Rip it up  
Get out what's inside of you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
On the edge of oblivion  
All the world is Babylon  
And all the love and ev'ryone  
A ship of fools sailing on  
(Ev'rybody)  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
(Ev'rybody)  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
  
Across the nation  
Around the world  
Ev'rybody have fun tonight  
A celebration so spread the word  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ev'rybody  
Ev'ryone
