I am the face of piss and shit and sugar  
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey  
What I want what I want is just your children  
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being  
Calliopenis envy from your daddy  
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear  
What I say disgusts him  
He wants to be me and that scares him  
"Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey"  
The black keys  
Here is my real head, here is my real real head  
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me  
Here is my real head  
They try to blink me not to think me  
Don't want to bring me out  
I am the rotten teeth, my fists are lined with suckers  
My prison skin's an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad  
I am your son  
Your dad  
Your fag  
I am your fad
