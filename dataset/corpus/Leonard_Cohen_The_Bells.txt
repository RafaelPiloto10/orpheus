(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
[cf the lyrics to the song "Anthem" on the Cohen album "The Future"]  
  
(Judy) The birds they sang at break of day  
Start again, I heard them say  
Nor dwell on what has passed away  
Or what is yet to be.  
  
The wars they will be fought again  
The holy dove be caught again  
Bought and sold and bought again  
Until we set them free.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack in everything  
The light behind to see.  
  
Add up the parts, not yours the sum  
Strike up the march, there is no drum  
Every heart to love must come  
Like a refugee
