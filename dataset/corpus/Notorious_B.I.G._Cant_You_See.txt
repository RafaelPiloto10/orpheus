Give me all the chicken heads from Pasadena to Medina  
Bet Big get in between ya  
Then pick the prognosis, doses  
Blends and Bends like Twizzlers  
Biggie's fitting to hurt  
What's under that skirt?  
(Slow down, son, you're killin us)  
Who fillin 'em with octane?  
Got 'em gassed up  
'Bout to get blast up, sup  
The last one, word to your mother  
Brother, listen  
I've seen it when he kissed 'em at the way  
Made his body shake  
The high tide it 8:50 I's smoke tank  
Rap terror whore crow and terror, true  
Fly by the rivers but this is conspicuous  
Bad Boys slipped in ninety-five ridiculous  
My rap's rhymes is like land mines  
One step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room  
To whom it may concern, Junior Mafia's the click  
Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your..  
  
In the middle day now baby  
I seem to think of only you, hey, oh yeah  
Never thinking for a moment baby  
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah, so  
  
I can't wait for the day  
That we can be together  
I can't let you walk away  
Can't you see you and me  
Were meant to be, oh baby  
And there's nothing left to say  
  
Can't you see what you do to me  
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby  
Can't you see what you do to me  
Our love was meant to be you were made for me  
  
Every time I see you  
I get this feeling, oh yeah  
Telling me you are the one  
Oh what a feeling, hey  
  
I can't wait for the day  
That we can be together  
I can't let you walk away  
Can't you see you and me  
Were meant to be, oh baby  
And there's nothing left to say  
  
Can't you see what you do to me  
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby  
Can't you see what you do to me  
Our love was meant to be you were made for me  
  
Take me away, so far away  
Oh what you do to me, oh  
I wanna be alone together  
Somewhere just you and me  
Oh, oh
