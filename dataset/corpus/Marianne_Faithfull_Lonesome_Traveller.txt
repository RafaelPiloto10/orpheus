I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Well, I've travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
Travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the beggar,  
Well, I've travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the  
Beggar,  
Travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the beggar,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.
