I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
What I had to do, had to run from you  
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong  
And that haunted me, all the way home  
So ya never know, never never know  
Never know enough, til it's over love  
Til we lose control, system overload  
Screaming no no no, no no  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you  
So I keep it low, keep a secret code  
So everybody else don't have to know  
  
[Chorus]  
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose  
  
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to  
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true  
I got something to lose, so I gotta move  
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too  
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own  
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone  
How many times did it take til I finally got through  
You lose, you lose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I had to go, I had to move  
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life  
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
I met no one new, I got no one new  
No I said I'm through, but got love for you  
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going  
Keep it on a roll, only god knows  
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused  
You choose, you choose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Way I wanna go, I don't need you  
I been down this road, too many times before  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
  
[Chorus]
