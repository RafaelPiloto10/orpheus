You've read the books, you've watched the shows  
What's the best way, no one knows  
  
Meditate, yea, hypnotized  
Anything to take it from your mind  
But it won't go  
You're doing all these things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
You had the drink, you take a toke  
Watch the past go up in smoke  
You fake a smile, ya, lie and say  
You're better now than ever and your life's okay  
But it's not, no  
  
You're doing all these things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
  
You tell your friends, yea strangers too  
Anyone who will throw an arm around you  
Tarot cards, gems and stones  
Believing all the shit's gonna heal your soul  
Well it's not, whoa  
  
You're only doing things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
  
Oh no there's no starting over  
Without finding closure  
You take them back no hesitation  
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation  
  
Oh no there's no starting over  
Without finding closure  
You take them back no hesitation  
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle

Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self
