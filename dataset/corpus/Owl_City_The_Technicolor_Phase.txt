I am the red in the rose, the flowers  
On the blankets on your bedroom floor.  
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides  
With your clothes behind your closet door.  
  
I am the green in the grass that bends back  
From underneath your feet.  
And I am the blue in your back alley view  
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet.  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars.  
You can go anywhere you wish cause I'll be there, wherever you are.  
(Wherever you are) [Repeat x2]  
  
(I will always be your gaze  
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase)  
  
I am the black in the book  
The letters on the pages that you memorize.  
And I am the orange in the overcast  
Of color that you visualize.  
  
I am the white in the walls that soak up  
All the sound when you cannot sleep.  
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach  
That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars. (my darling)  
You can go anywhere you wish cause I'll be there, wherever you are. (My
darling)  
  
(Wherever you are) [Repeat x3]
