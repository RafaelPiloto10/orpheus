Hey, can you hear me?  
I'm calling your name  
Hello, or is this goodbye?  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again?  
So I can rest my head  
  
Angel, angel! Dancing away  
As all of my thoughts get rearranged  
Angel, angel! Turning away  
Just when thing seem  
To have changed  
So I can rest my head  
  
Hey, can you hear me?  
I'm calling your name  
Hello, or is this goodbye?  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again?  
So I can rest my head
