4 in the morning  
And my roommate's still a-snoring  
So I take a walk out on the Boulevard  
  
The wind above me  
Seems to push and pull and shove me  
But it shows me all the places I could fly  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside  
  
I want to be something  
I don't know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
I see so clearly  
That the odds are stacked against me  
And that nobody else believes in me at all  
  
I'm all alone here  
And I have to face my own fear  
I have no choice but to keep on keeping on  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside, whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I don't know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
And if my dreams all come true someday, true someday  
I won't forget how I feel today, I feel today  
I'm blown away  
  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
  
Here I am, here I am  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside, whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I want to feel something  
I want to know that at least I tried
