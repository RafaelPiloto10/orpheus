What kind of man is enough to begin to understand  
How love begins so small  
From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has  
To hold on to  
You'll never let her go and you say  
What kind of girl.  
  
You'll never run anymore now that the world has come alive  
For you, you'll say (how did I once survive)  
What kind of girl does it take that gives everything she has  
Always you know you'll never let her go  
And you'll say what kind of girl  
  
CHORUS  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
  
From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has  
To hold on to  
You'll never let her go and you say  
What kind of girl  
  
CHORUS
