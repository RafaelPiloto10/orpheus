A world of difference  
A world so out of touch  
Overwhelmed by everything  
But wanting more so much  
  
Call it blind frustration  
Call it blind man's bluff  
Call each other names  
Your voices rude,  
Your voices rough  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's cool to be so tough  
  
Handle with kid gloves  
Handle with kid gloves  
Then you learn the lessons  
Taught in school won't be enough  
Put on your kid gloves  
Put on your kid gloves  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's cool to be so tough  
  
A world of indifference  
Heads and hearts too full  
Careless of the consequence  
Of constant push and pull  
  
Anger got bare knuckles  
Anger play the fool  
Anger wear a crown of thorns  
Reverse the golden rule  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's tough to be so cool  
  
Handle with kid gloves  
Handle with kid gloves  
Then you learn the weapons  
And the ways of hard-knock school  
Put on your kid gloves  
Put on your kid gloves  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's tough to be so cool
