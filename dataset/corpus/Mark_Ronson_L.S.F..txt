I'm on it, get on it  
The troops are on fire  
Ya know I need it much closer  
I'm tradin' just a little more  
  
Step on it, electronic  
The troops are on fire  
I'm much deeper, a sleeper  
Waitin' for the final trip  
  
Come on it, get on it  
I'm carving through a letter bomb  
I need it, loud potions  
These drugs are just an hour away  
  
Come on it, electronic  
A polyphonic prostitute  
The motors on fire  
Messiah for the animals  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
We got our backs to the wall  
Ah, get on and watch out  
Sayin', "You're gonna kill us all"  
  
Ah, I'm on it, get on it  
The troops are on fire  
You know I need it much closer  
I'm tradin' just a little more  
  
Step on it, electronic  
The troops are on fire  
I'm much deeper, a sleeper  
Messiah for the animals  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
Say, "We got our backs to the wall"  
Get on and watch out  
Ah, before you kill us all  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
Say, "We got our backs to the wall"  
Get on and watch out  
Ah, before you kill us all
