Another child is born  
Another race is won  
Another dream is shattered  
Another day has begun  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
Another broken heart  
Another lesson learnt  
Another harvest eaten  
Another night is gone  
A new day's begun  
Even your dreams they can be real  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope
