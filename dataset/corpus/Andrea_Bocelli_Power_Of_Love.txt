The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look in your eyes  
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
Even though there may be times it seems I'm far away  
But never wonder where I am cause I am always by your side  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love  
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I can't go on is light years away  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love
