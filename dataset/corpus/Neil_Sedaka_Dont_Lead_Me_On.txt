Oh please don't, don't lead me on,  
Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone.  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
You only have to tell me and I'll be on my way.  
  
Oh don't, don't make me cry,  
Don't say that you care if your love is just a lie.  
Don't build my hopes up to the sky.  
Please don't, don't lead me on.  
  
If, if you're gonna hurt me,  
Then please, please don't make me wait.  
Should we part, I'll get along somehow,  
So if you're gonna break my heart  
Then come on, break it now.  
  
But don't, don't lead me on,  
Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone.  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
Please don't, don't lead me on.  
  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
Oh don't, don't lead me on.
