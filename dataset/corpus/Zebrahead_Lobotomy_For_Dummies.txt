You can lie to me and say it's you I adore  
You can poison me and drown me on the shore  
You can kick me again when I'm down on the floor  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
You say I'm desperate and if I'm desperate  
At least I'm honest  
At least I own it  
And if I'm desperate  
Reap what you sow  
Give me some more!  
Give me some more!  
  
She said, thanks for my misery  
Then I said, Hell needed company,  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said, "I wish you were dead"  
  
Left me out in the gutter  
To settle a score  
Poured salt on my wounds  
When my stitches tore  
And now I'm giving it back  
'Cause payback's a whore  
I'm slamming the door  
I'm slamming the door  
'Cause now I'm over  
And since I'm over it  
Ill be honest  
I think you're heartless  
I think you need this  
Reap what you sow  
I'm slamming the door!  
I'm slamming the door!
