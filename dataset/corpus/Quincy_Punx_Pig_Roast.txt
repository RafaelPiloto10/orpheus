  
there's a party at my place  
Bring a healthy appetite and a liter or a case.  
We got a barbecue pit out back of the house  
Turning on a spit with an apple in his mouth,  
Is the walkin' slab of bacon that tried shutting us down.  
Now he's basted in beer and turning golden brown  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.  
We were drinking out in the sun,  
When this boar in blue showed up to try and spoil our fun  
Started out front as a diversion tactic,  
While the rest of the guys went up to the attic,  
Opened up the window and jumped down on his head,  
And they beat him with forty-ouncers till he was dead  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.  
Officer friendly is now an entree.  
He's been turning on the rotisserie all day.  
Well it looks like the piggy couldn't stand the heat  
Now he's just pork, the other white meat  
Tenderize him with his own night stick,  
And cut him into pork-chops juicy and thick  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.
