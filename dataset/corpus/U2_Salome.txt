Baby please  
Baby please don't go  
I got lies to feed  
They want skin and seed  
And don't make me crawl  
  
Please  
Baby don't bite your lip  
Give you half what I got  
If you untie the knot  
It's a promise  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby what's that tune  
Well I heard it before  
When I crawled from your door  
And my blood turned blue  
  
Please  
Baby please slow down  
Baby I feel sick  
Don't make me stick to my promise  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby don't say no  
Won't you dance for me  
Under the cherry tree  
Won't you swing down low  
  
Please  
Baby please say yes  
Baby don't go away  
You're spilling me  
And your precious love  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome
