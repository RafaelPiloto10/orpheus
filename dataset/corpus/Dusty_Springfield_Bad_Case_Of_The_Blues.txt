Such a bad case of the blues  
  
I thought that you would be  
A little different when it came to lovin' me  
Now, I see I was living a dream  
'Cause all I do is cry and kiss your love goodbye  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
  
I thought that I would never see  
How it feels to live a life of misery  
I don't have anything to look forward to  
But miss the love I've lost and pay the loser's cost  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
  
Now all I do is cry  
And kiss your love goodbye, hey  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you, babe  
Such a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you, yeah  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you, babe  
Such a bad case of the blues  
It's what I get from lovin' you
