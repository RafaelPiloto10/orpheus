You like to hurt me you know that you do  
You like to think in some way that its me and not you  
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it  
You don't know why I wont act the way you think I should  
You thought they'd make me, behave and submit  
  
What were you thinking, cause I don't forget  
  
You don't know why  
I wont give in  
To hell with the pressure  
I'm not caving in  
You know that I got under your skin  
You sold your soul but I wont let you win  
You talk to much  
You say I do  
Difference is know one cares about you  
  
You've got all the answers  
You know everything  
Well nobody asked you  
Its a mystery to me  
  
I'm sorry for you  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe  
I'm sorry for you  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You don't know who you can trust now  
But you should believe  
You should believe  
You close your eyes  
All well and good  
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would  
You tell them story's they'd rather believe  
Use and confuse them their numb and naive  
Truth is the truth hurts don't you agree  
Its harder to live with the truth about you  
Than to live with the lies about me  
  
Know body owes you  
Not one god damn thing  
You know where to put your  
Just shut up and say  
  
I'm sorry for you  
  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe  
  
I'm sorry for you  
  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free
