Don't run away  
I can't live without you  
Please stay  
And I'll learn to love you right  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I'm not going to  
Lose you tonight  
  
Don't run away  
I never wanted to hurt you  
Please stay  
And I learn to treat you right  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I'm not going to  
Lose you tonight  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I ain't gonna  
Lose you tonight  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I ain't gonna  
Lose you tonight  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life
