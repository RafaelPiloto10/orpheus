How does it fell babe  
To taste sweet revenge  
Do you want me on my knees  
How does it feel babe  
  
To let me feel your strength  
Don't be cruel, can't you see  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't tell me "no way"  
Babe I miss you so much more than words can say  
  
How does it feel babe  
To kill our destiny  
I swear I'm not gonna crawl oh no  
How does it feel babe  
  
To make a fool out of me  
How can you be so cold  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't treat me this way  
Ooh I miss you, I miss you  
  
Baby our love's got what it takes  
To give us one more chance to start once again  
Baby our love will find a way  
As long as we believe in love
