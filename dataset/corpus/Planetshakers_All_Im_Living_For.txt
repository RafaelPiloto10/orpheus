Here I am waiting for You,  
Here I am reaching out to You,  
I will run into Your arms again,  
And I' m longing for Your touch once again,  
  
Take my life, everything, All I am,  
An offering for you,  
Cause you' re all I' m living for  
  
Here I am waiting on You,  
Here I am reaching out for You,  
I will run into Your arms again,  
And I' m longing for Your touch once again,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take my life, everything, All I am,  
An offering for you,  
Cause you' re all I' m living for  
Take my heart, all of me,  
I' m laying it down, to worship You my God  
Cause You' re all I' m living for,  
  
I will run into Your open arms,  
To your love, that washes away my fears  
I am found, deep in this mystery,  
Cause You' re all I' m living for  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Cause You' re all,  
You' re All I' m living for,  
Jesus You' re all,  
All I' m living for.
