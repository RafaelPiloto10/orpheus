You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know it's not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But you're wasting your time  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
I'm so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesn't ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing  
Says she really couldn't tell  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I can't  
  
I won't comb my hair for you anymore  
I won't be in early  
I won't be in late  
I won't be in at all so don't sit in and wait  
  
You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But there's no chance  
Now there's no one else to see  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
I'm so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung
