Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Best friends as far as I could tell  
Cheerleaders except for Denise  
She was the wild one  
She was the beast  
She was the one who named the group  
The original gang of four  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
Tenth grade Central in September  
That was a year I remember  
On this chilly cold afternoon  
I overheard the gang in the locker room  
Rendezvous, Mary's house  
Dirty words and wine  
Needless to say they all spend the day  
Just counting time, counting time  
Halfway through her history class  
Denise she kindly raised her hand and asked  
If she could be excused ("Can I be excused?")  
Then she ran from school (ran from school) in a hurry,  
The other girls, ooh they knew  
This is what friends are really for  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
Circle of amore  
  
Imagination showed a window (imagination)  
On a cold September day (ooh)  
Leaves are brown (brown), passion sounds (ooh)  
Memory self astray  
Four hands in the place where the feet connect  
(Gang of four)  
Circle of sex  
In the vicious race to maturity  
They're almost phased from ecstasy  
Sweat upon the necks of dames  
Loser in the circle game  
Cause memories are worth so much more (so much more)  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
(Ooh)  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore
