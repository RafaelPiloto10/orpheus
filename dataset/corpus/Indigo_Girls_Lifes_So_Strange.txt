Cold black coffee  
Incessant stream of cars  
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars  
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground  
Today the rains just water  
It wont stop from falling down  
  
I grow weary waiting for my muse  
But in between the times she comes  
I still have to tie my shoes  
And get on with my day  
There are mornings when Im more vigorous  
And there are days I have to take the bus  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
  
Secret rendezvous  
Long distance from a phone booth  
Like two players in a mystery straight out of our youth  
Well Im finding that dramatics have lost their old appeal  
I play the part of stoic lover but Im not sure how I feel  
I get discouraged waiting for the world  
To understand this love affair  
To understand the girl  
There are moments when amelias right beside me  
The next thing I know  
I taste the salt of the sea  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
  
Cold black coffee  
Incessant stream of cars  
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars  
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground  
Today the rains just water  
It wont stop from falling down  
  
I grow weary Im waiting for the world  
To understand this love affair  
To understand the girl  
There are moments when amelias right beside me  
The next thing I know, I taste the salt of the sea  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
Lifes so strange  
Oh
