However hard they try to hold you back  
So you are stronger  
And there's the slightest ray of hope  
Or glimmer in your eyes  
  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you (love me madly, truly, deeply)  
  
I love you (take another lover)  
(love me madly, truly, deeply)  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you  
Every night you need to satisfy  
Your pangs of hunger  
  
As if your name were written out  
In lights across the sky  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you (love me madly, truly, deeply)  
I love you (take another lover)  
(love me madly, truly, deeply)  
  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say  
  
However hard they try to hold you back  
So you are stronger  
Take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take another lover  
Take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take another lover
