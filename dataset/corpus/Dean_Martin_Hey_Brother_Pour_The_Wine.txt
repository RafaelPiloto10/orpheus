Here we sit enjoying the shade  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Drink the drink that I have made  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Tell you why the day is sunny  
I'm in love with lips of honey  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She is coming here to stay  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
I have waited for the day  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She writes of love in every letter  
Others have tried but I will get her  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
What is life? What is spring?  
What are all the stars that shine?  
Love, my friend is everything  
And love will soon be mine  
Pour it as quickly as you can  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour it quickly once again  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She's here at last my one and only  
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Blink your eyes and love has passed  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Her's was never made to last  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She introduced me to another  
No my friends, he's not her brother  
I will miss the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour the wine, pour the wine  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour the wine
