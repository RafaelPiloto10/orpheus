Lyrics by Jimmy Buffett  
Music by Buffett, Kunkel, Guth, P. Mayer, J. Mayer  
I'm a cultural infidel, painting in the dark  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing in the park  
Socrates, hypothesis, the music of Mozart  
I'm a cultural infidel, coming from the heart  
  
Free thinkin', hoodwinkin', unblinkin' man  
Start trouble, burst bubbles, join my caravan  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, I guess it could be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel trying to draw a crowd  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing right out loud  
Philosophy is not for me, laughing is my game  
I'm a cultural infidel, slap me with the blame  
  
Loose cannon, Armageddon, preachers at the door  
Spittin' poison at the boys 'n girls on dance floor  
I hear them in the congress, I see them on TV  
I hope the Inquisition remains a memory  
  
Al'Diablo Picasso, Al'Diablo Manet  
Al'Diablo Fontainebleau, Al'Diable Hemingway  
O'Diab Dr. Thompson, O'Diab St. Joan  
O'Diab Village Paeople, O'Diab Rolling Stones  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, it might as well be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel, believe in common sense  
I'm a cultural infidel, love the present tense  
But we have to keep a look out for those mean old backed-up farts  
I'm a cultural infidel, comin' from the heart  
  
My heart, my heart, mon coeur  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you in Rio, only time will tell  
  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you tomorrow, only time will tell
