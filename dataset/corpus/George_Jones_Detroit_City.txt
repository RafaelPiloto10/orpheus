I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home  
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home  
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother  
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long  
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home  
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine  
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars  
If only they could read between the lines  
Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time  
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride  
And put it on a Southbound freight and ride  
And go on back to the loved ones the ones that I left waitin' so far behind  
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home
