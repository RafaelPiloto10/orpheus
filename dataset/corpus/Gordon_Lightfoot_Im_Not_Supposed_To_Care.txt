I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away  
You got places to go, you got people to see  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
But anyway  
  
I wish you good spaces in  
The far away places you go  
If it rains or it snows may  
You be safe and warm and never grow old  
And if you need someone who loves you, why  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
  
I'll give you the keys to  
My flying machine if you'd like  
I will show you the light and when you call  
I'm gonna come to you  
And when you find someone who loves you,  
I'll know you would treat me the same  
Just lie there, you're not supposed to care  
  
I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away.  
That's some kind of a game  
Still I'm glad it came down  
To the final round  
But anyway  
  
If you think you need someone who needs you,  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care
