(ian hunter)  
  
We walked to the sea, just my father and me  
And the dogs played around on the sand.  
Winter cold cut the air, hanging still everywhere  
Dressed in gray did he say hold my hand?  
I said love's easier when it's far away  
We sat and watched the distant lights.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
And we smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night.  
  
There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky.  
There's another that rides far behind.  
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide  
Ways apart as we drift on through time.  
He said it's harder now you're far away  
We only read you when you write.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We both smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, oh it's just that we're out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We're two ships that pass in the night
