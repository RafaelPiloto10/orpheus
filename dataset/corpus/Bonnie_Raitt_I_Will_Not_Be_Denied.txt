A true love story  
Is hard to find  
Can't get no rest  
Got no peace of mind  
You say you gave  
Your heart to me  
You put me down  
You set me free  
  
You said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
I guess you know he is because  
  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Always takes you by surprise  
  
There you was  
The only one  
Coming on me and ruining my fun  
  
Leave me setting  
At home all alone  
Waitin' on your call by the telephone  
  
You said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
Guess you know you always was deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
  
Finally made me realize  
That I tried and tried  
But you just cant get enough  
So you lied and lied and lied  
I will not be denied  
I'm gonna plant a seed  
I will not be denied  
Of the man and the love I need  
  
Said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
Guess you know you are because  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Always takes you by surprise  
  
Its a sad situation  
When yes it's true  
I can say it baby  
I'm through with you  
Its over now  
And in the past  
Gonna find me a man  
With a love that'll last  
You know he's deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
  
Guess you know you always been  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Finally made me realize  
  
That I tried and tried  
But you just couldn't get enough  
And so you  
Lied and lied and lied  
And I will not be denied  
I will not be denied  
I will not be denied
