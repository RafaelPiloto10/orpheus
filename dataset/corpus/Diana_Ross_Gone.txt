You've been in love once before  
But never quite like this, no  
And you fall in love more and more  
With every single kiss, yeah  
So tell me why do you do the things  
That you continue to do  
When I'm not the one who hurt you so  
I wouldn't cheat on you  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
You go through life searchin' for love  
And you're lucky if you find, yeah  
Someone who cares about you so  
And will never mislead you, no  
But If you hide the way you feel  
Why do you carry on?  
'Cause I won't stay around  
To wait on you to make up your mind, yeah  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
I'm gone, I'm gone  
You'll dream about love and wake up  
To find I'm gone, I'm gone  
You'll start to think and reminisce  
That I'm gone, I'm gone
