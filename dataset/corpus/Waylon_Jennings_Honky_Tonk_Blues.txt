Well I left my home down on a rural route  
And I told my folks I'm goin' steppin' out  
To get the honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
In and out of every joint in this town  
The city life has really got me down  
I got the honky tonk blues the honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
[ guitar ]  
I'm gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm  
Scud right back in my pappy's farm  
And lose these honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
[ steel ]  
Well I left my home down on a rural route...
