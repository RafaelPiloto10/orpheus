Holding on to the rhythm  
I'm standing in my leather and lace  
People move to the left, and  
Move to the right, and  
  
The whole place starts to shake  
Without a net on a real high wire  
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire  
I started dancing with a stranger  
  
Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger  
And I just got swept away  
Letting go my inhibitions  
  
Is harder to do than say  
But I surrender to the beat  
I start shuffling my feet  
When I hear that music play  
  
I trip the light fantastic  
I touch the sky and it feels like magic  
I started dancing with a stranger  
Moving to the break of day  
  
Dancing with a stranger  
And I just got swept away  
Give me a dance, dance  
Dancing with a stranger  
  
And it takes my breath away  
I ain't looking for mister right  
It doesn't matter to me  
There's something in the air  
  
Electric I like  
Igniting endlessly  
I started to dance...  
Without a net on a real high wire  
  
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire  
I started dancing with a stranger  
Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger  
  
And I just got swept away...
