About five o'clock in the late afternoon sun's gettin' drowsy above me  
Tonight I walk neath the sparkling moon with the girl who is happy to love me  
She's my sweet country girl and she's all that I need  
The whole world wears the smile when she's talking  
Sweet country girl it's not hard to believe  
Pretty flowers bloom wherever she's been walking uh-huh  
  
Shadows erase in the last light of day night time is startin' to settle  
Red colored stone Lord is leading my way to her cottage way down in the meadow  
She's my sweet country girl...  
  
Green trees and golden hay and sunshine here every day  
Big cities far behind me well it's love with her to think I'm a gonna stay  
About five o'clock in the late afternoon...  
She's my sweet country girl yes she is  
She's my sweet country girl and I love her she's my sweet country girl
