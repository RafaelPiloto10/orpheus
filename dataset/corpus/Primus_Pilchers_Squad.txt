He's found a way to make them pay  
For the deviant things they do and say  
Pilcher, Sgt. Pilcher, quick-witted Sgt. Pilcher  
He's a dutiful man with his task at hand  
And he's bound to insure with his master plan  
The purity of the motherland, Sgt. Pilcher  
  
In October of 1968 in the heart of Montague Square  
There was rumor of some deviation  
So Pilcher's Squad was there  
Though it was determined before the intrudence  
The flat was fully clear  
When Pilcher arrived and made his inspection  
The hashing magically appeared

In March of 1969 on return from the store  
Patty Harrison found Pilcher's squad waiting at her door  
Planting tidbits on the pop-stars seemed quite the thing to do  
'Till it landed Pilcher in the pokie in 1972
