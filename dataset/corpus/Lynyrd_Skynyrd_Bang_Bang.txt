Somewhere south of winslow the road went right and I went left  
Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death  
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air  
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear  
  
Oh, I picked her up  
  
Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck  
Said I know a place called the broken wheel where we can try our luck  
Five miles north of 66, behind old man lester's barn  
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sheriff claims that he don't
know  
  
Oh, here I go again, singin'  
  
Bang bang  
That cell door's closin' in  
Bang bang  
Here I go again  
Bang bang  
Those chains around my legs  
Bang bang  
This is where the highway ends  
  
4 am I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear  
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear  
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes  
When the door flew open, she came out screamin'  
Drive fool drive!  
  
Oh, here I go again singin'  
  
Bang bang  
That cell door's closin' in  
Bang bang  
Here I go again  
Bang bang  
Those chains around my legs  
Bang bang  
Yeah this is where the highway ends  
  
Oh, blue lights in my eyes  
Oh, I must've been outta my mind!  
  
Bang bang  
That cell door's closin' in  
Bang bang  
Here I go again  
Bang bang  
Those chains around my legs  
Bang bang  
This is where the highway ends  
  
Here I go again  
  
Bang bang!
