You can't escape the wrath of my heart  
Beating to your funeral song  
All faith is lost and hell, regained  
In the dust of the wrath of shame, just be brave  
  
Let me wake in the sun of my heart  
We move along this path in the dark  
Where I belong until my feet grow cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me like you held onto life  
When all fears came alive and entombed me  
Love me like you love the sun  
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart  
  
I'll be the thorn in every rose you give  
Sin my woe, I am the nightmare waking you up  
From the dream, the dream of love  
  
And paint you my soul, scarred and alone  
I wait for your kiss to take me home  
  
[Chorus]
