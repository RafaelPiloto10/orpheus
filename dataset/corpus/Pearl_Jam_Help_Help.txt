Tell me what I want to hear  
This shit's too good to be true, my dear  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Storybook keeps from hurting me, you see  
Shell of the man from the sea  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me  
Tell me why, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Reservoir of hate and fear  
Invisible, in repair  
A hundred thieves cast a spell  
This is hell  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes  
He looks just like me, a mirror  
The more you read, we've been deceived  
Everyday it becomes clearer  
Clearer, clearer, clearer, clearer...  
Not my enemy  
No, not my enemy  
Don't speak for me  
No, not my enemy
