Gone away, gone away  
Moving away, yeah  
Moving away, yeah  
All I wanted to say, girl  
Ah, moving away  
  
Left with my own blues  
'Cause I love you, ah  
Left here all alone, yeah  
Left alone here to sing this song  
Can't believe that you're gone  
I love you, baby  
  
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah, ah  
Can't believe it, baby, ah  
Ah, can't believe it,  
I feel my lovin' and I need you  
I feel my lovin' and I need you, baby  
Baby, yeah  
I need you baby
