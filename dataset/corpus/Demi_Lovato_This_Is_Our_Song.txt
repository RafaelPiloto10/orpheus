So let's sing na, na na na na, hey ya  
C'mon and sing na, na na na na, hey ya  
  
This is our song  
That's all that matters cause  
We all belong right here together  
There's nothin' better  
Than singing along  
This is our summer  
This is our song  
  
Come grab your guitar  
Sit by the fire  
Cause we all need a song  
When we're weary and tired  
We'll sit here  
Together  
And sing it out loud  
  
This is our song  
That's all that matters cause  
We all belong right here together  
There's nothin' better  
Than singing along  
This is our summer  
And this is our song  
This our song  
This is our song
