So don't give me respect  
Don't give me a piece of your preciousness  
Flaunt all she's got in our old neighbourhood  
I'm sure she'll make a few friends  
Even the rain bows down  
Let us pray as you cock cock cock your mane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you  
I can be cruel  
I don't know why  
Why can't my ba.ll.oo.n stay up  
In a perfectly windy sky  
I can be cruel I don't know why  
  
Dance with the Sufi's  
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain  
Lover brother bogenvilla my vine twists around your need  
Even the rain is sharp  
Like today as you sh-sh-shock me sane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you
