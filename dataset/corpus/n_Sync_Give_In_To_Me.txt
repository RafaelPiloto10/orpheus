Aaaaaahhhhhhhh  
Ooooooooooo  
Heeeeeeey  
  
Your love like a candle  
Flickers in the dark  
You came into my life  
Brightened up my heart  
  
With you by my side  
I see the love that I wanna feel  
Show me your lovin' baby  
Show me that it's real  
  
Just take my hand  
I'll make you understand  
I want you (I want you)  
You want me (you want me too)  
And that's the way it's got to be  
Now that you're here  
I'm gonna make it clear  
  
Chorus:  
Give me the love I need  
Give in to me  
Hold me, caress me  
Give in to me  
Give me the love I need  
Give in to me  
Just give in to me  
  
Your love is like a whisper (whisper)  
Say what I wanna hear (what I wanna hear)  
Your eyes cry secrets  
And my heart will dry your tears  
I need to have you near me  
Loving I would find  
Girl, I would hold your heart  
Inside, embrace your mind  
  
Just take my hand  
I'll make you understand  
I want you (I want you)  
You want me (you want me too)  
And that's the way it's got to be  
Now that you're here  
I'm gonna make it clear  
  
Chorus  
  
Just give me the love I need  
I need your lovin' tonight, sweet lady  
I wonder what the nights'd be like  
Without you near me  
Yeah, give in to me, girl  
I need you by my side  
Just give me the love I need  
I need your lovin', baby  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
(Chorus repeat to fade)
