I woke this morning in a different disguise  
And I was crying, crying  
You said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I caught the mirror as I opened your letter  
I was lying, lying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
It was dying, dying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
I see you crying, crying  
You say it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another earthquake  
Another shipwreck, I understand  
It's time to admit  
Despite our endeavors  
Can't find whatever we lost  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home  
I may never see home  
I may never see home again  
I woke this morning in a different disguise  
(Another shipwreck)  
I cracked a mirror as I opened your letter  
(Another shipwreck)  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
(Another shipwreck)  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
(Another shipwreck)  
Shipwreck  
Shipwreck
