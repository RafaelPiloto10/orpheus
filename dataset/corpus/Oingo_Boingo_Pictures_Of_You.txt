Pictures of you  
It's just pictures of you, through the bedroom door  
With that sly little grin, says you want it some more  
But there's people around, and they don't look so nice  
Tell me why don't they move, this has happened before  
This has happened before  
It's just pictures of you  
In darkness  
  
Pictures of you  
I'd been sleeping for hours,  
when you came to my house  
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out  
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad  
So you wanted to play  
Yes, you wanted to play  
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go  
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold  
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could  
Stay  
And I said no!  
It's just pictures of you  
In darkness  
  
(Pictures of you)  
In that lovely white dress, oh your skin was so white  
With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night  
When your lips were so soft, that I though they would  
Melt,  
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt  
And I said yes  
And I said yes  
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand  
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand  
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff  
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips  
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh  
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream  
Why do pictures of you  
Come to me when I dream  
In darkness  
  
Pictures of you  
Pictures of you  
Pictures of you
