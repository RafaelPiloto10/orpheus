When you just give love  
And never get love  
You'd better let love depart  
I know it's so and yet I know  
I can't get you out of my heart  
  
You made me leave my happy home  
You took my love and now you're gone  
Since I fell for you  
Love brings such misery and pain  
I know I'll never be the same  
Since I fell for you  
  
It's too bad, it's too sad  
But I'm in love with you  
You love me, then you snub me  
Oh, what can I do?  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I guess I'll never see the light  
I get the blues most every night  
Since I fell for you  
Since I fell for you
