These arms of mine  
They are lonely  
Lonely and feeling blue  
  
These arms of mine  
They are yearning  
Yearning from wanting you  
And if you  
  
Would let them hold you  
How grateful I will be  
  
These arms of mine  
The are burning  
Burning from wanting you  
These arms of mine  
  
The are wanting  
Wanting to hold you  
  
And if you  
Just let them hold you  
How grateful I will be  
How grateful I will be  
  
Come on come on baby  
Just be my woman  
Just be my lover  
I need someone  
  
Somebody to hold me tight  
And I need  
Your warm, warm loving arms  
Around me tonight  
  
Just let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
Let my arms hold you  
Just let them hold you  
  
Please let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
Come on let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
  
Please let me hold you  
Just let me hold you
