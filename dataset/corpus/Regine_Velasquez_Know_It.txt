Do you belong to me all the way  
I never thought I'd have to ask someday  
I don't really know what you mean to say  
I'm so afraid to just let go  
Though I'd believe if you let me know  
No matter how much you mean to me  
I couldn't just take that risk with you right now  
But whatever I do, can't resist your love  
It's all up to you  
Before we can start something new  
Refrain:  
(Know it)  
I wanna give it a chance  
First I must know you love me  
(Know it)  
I've got to see you again  
(Know it)  
Oh, how I wish you were sure  
'Cause I wanna start believing  
Know what you're feeling  
So I can let go  
No matter how much you mean to me  
I couldn't just take that risk with you right now  
Stayin' away gets harder and harder  
As I go on alone  
The more I want you here with me  
(Repeat Refrain)  
(Know it)  
(I wanna give it a chance)  
(First I must know you love me)  
(Know it)  
I've got to see you again  
(Know it)  
Oh how I wish you were sure  
'Cause I wanna start believing  
(Know what you're feeling)  
So I can let  
I can let go...
