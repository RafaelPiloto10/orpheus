Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch  
Burn it up, no need to reconcile  
Come and see me, I'm your west end perfect stranger, in America  
Lady on that state's so full of style  
Stand up, turn around, beat it out  
You gotta sound, Joe  
Swing low and now I know  
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe  
The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin' night and day
[?]  
No one said that you would need a crowd  
The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better
make  
And now I only see your face in clouds  
Stand up, turn around, beat it out  
You gotta sound, Joe  
Swing low and now I know  
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe  
Stand up, turn around, beat it out  
You gotta sound, Joe  
Swing low and now I know  
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe  
Tell me so [?]  
Do you know  
Does it show  
When I'm low  
And then again, when I feel your love from far away, I think of yesterday  
I see a family we know how to smile  
There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along  
There comes a time when we will walk that mile  
Stand up, turn around, beat it out  
You gotta sound, Joe  
Swing low and now I know  
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe  
Stand up, turn around, beat it out  
You gotta sound, Joe  
Swing low and now I know  
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe
