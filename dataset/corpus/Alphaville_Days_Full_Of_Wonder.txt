When you feel so far away though you're close to everything  
And the feeling of estrangement's creeping up on spider's legs  
Even in these days of wonder, even in the age of faith  
There are some who goin' under  
There are some who never got it made  
So you passed so many years in a labyrinth of traces  
Running round and round they led to no one but yourself  
Here comes the eternal stranger  
He who has fallen from grace to the iron grounds  
And I'm tolling my bell just to let you know  
I'm here by your side in these days full of wonder  
In the ashes of your time when the dragon screams for more  
The reptiles make their comeback in your eyes  
And heroes fall for heroin and heaven falls for fake  
And doris' daisies burn to hell on the grand parade of lies  
In the middle of the night when the last of God has died  
And the only friend you've got is the heartbeat of the clock  
That music plays for all time, the tv light is freezing  
The war-paint on your face..
