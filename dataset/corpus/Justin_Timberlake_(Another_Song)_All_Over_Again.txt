You've been alone  
You've been afraid  
I've been a fool  
In so many ways  
But I would change my life  
If you thought you might try to love me  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
I'm not a saint  
I'm just a man  
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand  
But I threw it away  
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness  
And if you could just  
  
Please, give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
Little girl, you're all I've got  
Don't you leave me standing here once again  
'Cause I'll give you my life (yes I would)  
If you would let me try to love you  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
And take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
Again, oh  
No no  
Oh oh  
  
You know I love you (yeah)  
Give me one more chance  
No no  
No no no no
