I climbed off your back  
Not so long ago  
To a blooming meadow  
To a path you'd made for the lightest feet  
  
Mother, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
We are the story of one  
  
Father, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
You are forever in me  
  
This verse we wrote on our road home  
For you, all this for you  
All this for you  
  
Our walk has been sublime  
A soaring ride and gentle leap  
You have the heart of a true friend  
One day we'll meet on that shore again  
  
Mother, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
We are the story of one  
  
Oh father, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
You are forever in me
