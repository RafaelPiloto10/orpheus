Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born king"  
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled  
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim "Christ is born in Bethlehem"  
  
Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born king"  
  
Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord  
Late in time behold Him come, offspring of the favored one  
Veiled in flesh, the godhead see, hail the incarnate deity  
Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel  
  
Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born king"  
  
Hail, the heaven born prince of peace, hail the son of righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings, risen with healing in His wings  
Mild He lays his glory by, born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth  
  
Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born king"
