You came into my life like an answer to a prayer  
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air  
Some might say it's a miracle or a dream come true  
But from that day I always knew  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
No one else in the world has touched me like you do  
It's super natural, girl, the way I feel when I'm with you  
I'm in paradise whenever you're around  
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
I'm in paradise whenever you're around  
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
Right here with me  
You're right here
