Dearest Esmeralda, in another age  
Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage  
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace  
Love would be the passion and the saving grace  
  
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris  
Made up for a thousand wasted years  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
I close my eyes and you make love appear  
  
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier  
Shadows singing so low only we could hear  
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm  
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm  
  
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder  
Now I wake and find you're never there  
I'm becoming old enough to wonder  
Happy that I'm still too young to care  
  
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down  
Refugees and fantasies go underground  
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away  
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday  
  
Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris  
we were part of some artist's design  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
In the gray around me how you shine  
  
Oh oh, how you shine
