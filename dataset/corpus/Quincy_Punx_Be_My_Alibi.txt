  
A life of crimes not easy, sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with, and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder, or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stand's the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows,  
Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,  
Let's get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight, and listen, and I'll tell you what to say.  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Don't ask any question about the money in the closet  
You'll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike, that's the way it's gotta be,  
Even if it's gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
I'm gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
You've got to tell the jury that it really wasn't me  
Just remember what to say when you're on the stand  
I'm sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Be my alibi!
