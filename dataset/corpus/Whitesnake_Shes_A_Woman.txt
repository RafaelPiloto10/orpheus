She got everything I need,  
She makes me smile, she makes me bleed  
'Cause she's a woman  
  
She got the end, she got the means,  
She's in my heart and in my dreams  
An' it makes me cry I want to make her mine  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old,  
She shine like silver, burn like gold  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She got everything I need,  
She got comfort, she got speed  
She's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She do me bad, she do me good,  
She got the Gypsy in her blood  
'Cause' she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old,  
Shine like silver, burn like gold  
She's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She got a fire in her eyes,  
I know she sees through all my lies,  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
I know I'm the danger zone  
If I leave her all alone  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old,  
Shine like silver, burn like gold  
She's a woman, woman,  
She's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She's a woman, woman,  
She's a woman  
  
She got everything I need,  
She make me smile, she make me bleed  
She's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She got the end, she got the means,  
She, make me shiver in my jeans  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old  
She shine like silver, burn like gold  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She's a woman
