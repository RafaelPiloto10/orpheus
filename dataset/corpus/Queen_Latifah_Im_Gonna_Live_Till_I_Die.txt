I'm gonna live till I die! I'm gonna laugh 'stead of cry,  
I'm gonna take the town and turn it upside down,  
I'm gonna live, live, live until I die.  
  
They're gonna say "What a gal!" I'm gonna play for the sky.  
Ain't gonna miss a thing, I'm gonna have my fling,  
I'm gonna live, live, live until I die.  
  
The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low,  
They'll never trail over my head.  
I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then.  
Hallelujah, gonna dance, gonna fly, I'll take a chance riding high,  
Before my number's up, I'm gonna fill my cup,  
  
I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die!  
  
The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low,  
They'll never trail over my head.  
I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then.  
Hallelujah, gonna dance, gonna fly, I'll take a chance riding high,  
Before my number's up, I'm gonna fill my cup.  
  
I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die!
