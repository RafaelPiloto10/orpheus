She's a wonderful lady  
And she's mine, all mine  
And there doesn't seem a way  
That she won't come and lose my mind  
It's too easy humming songs  
To a girl in a yellow dress  
It's been a long time since the party  
And the room is in a mess  
  
The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor  
There are birds out on the sidewalk  
And a valet at the door  
He reminds me of a penguin  
With few and plastered hair  
There's talcum powder on the letter  
And the birthday boy is there  
  
Why don't you cut your hair?  
Why don't you live up there?  
Why don't you do what I do,  
See what I feel when I care?  
  
Now they've darkened all the windows  
And the seats are naugahide  
I've been waiting for an hour  
I can't find a place to hide  
The being known as wondergirl  
Is speaking, I believe  
It's not easy trying to tell her  
That I shortly have to leave  
  
Why don't you be like me?  
Why don't you stop and see?  
Why don't you hate who I hate,  
Kill who I kill to be free?  
  
Why don't you cut your hair?  
Why don't you live up there?  
Why dodn't you do what I do,  
See what I feel when I care?  
  
Why don't you be like me? (She's a wonderful lady)  
Why don't you stop and see? (And she's mine, all mine)  
Why don't you hate who I hate, (And there doesn't seem a way)  
Kill who I kill to be free? (That she won't come and lose my mind)  
Why don't you cut your hair? (It's too easy humming songs)  
Why don't you live up there? (To a girl in a yellow dress)  
Why don't you do what I do, (It's been a long time since the party)  
See what I feel when I care? (And the room is in a mess)
