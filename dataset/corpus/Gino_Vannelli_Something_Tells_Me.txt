Tonight I watch you in your sleep  
Wondering what dark secrets you keep  
Away from me  
A careless word falls from your lips  
A time and place that somehow slips  
From a memory  
I feel my way through darkness  
But I trust in where your heart is  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause each time I close my eyes  
I can see better  
I dream that we share our lives  
Now and forever  
Call it faith or just a feeling  
Something tells me to believe in you  
  
I feel you near but you're not there  
And I feel quiet despair  
Of what I might do  
I hear a voice inside of me  
That cries through the uncertainty  
That I feel for you  
There are no answers  
But I'll take my chances  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Something tells me (I believe in you)  
Something tells me (you know I believe in you)  
Everytime I close my eyes  
Oh you know I believe in you  
Something tells me.
