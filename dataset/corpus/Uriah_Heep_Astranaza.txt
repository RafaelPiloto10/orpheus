Hey girl, you're the one  
That got me started  
And I bet you'll be  
The one to get us parted  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Now everybody's had their fun  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
Ooh, but the answer  
In your eyes is never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody's had their fun  
Well, you and me  
And we know what we're saying  
To the rest of them  
It's a game we're playing  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
We were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody else will come  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
Ooh, but the answer  
In your eyes is never, never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Or the mother of my son  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
But the answer in your eyes is never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
You and me  
And we know what we're saying  
To the rest of them  
It's a game we're playing  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
We were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Or the mother of my son  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
Like astranaza  
Astranaza ...
