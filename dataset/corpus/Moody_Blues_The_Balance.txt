After he had journeyed,  
And his feet were sore,  
And he was tired,  
He came upon an orange grove  
And he rested.  
  
And he lay in the cool,  
And while he rested,  
He took to himself an orange  
And tasted it,  
And it was good.  
  
And he felt the earth to his spine,  
And he asked,  
And he saw the tree above him,  
And the stars,  
And the veins in the leaf,  
And the light,  
And the balance.  
  
And he saw magnificent perfection,  
Whereon he thought of himself in balance,  
And he knew he was.  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start  
  
And he thought of those he angered,  
For he was not a violent man,  
And he thought of those he hurt  
For he was not a cruel man  
And he thought of those he frightened  
For he was not a evil man,  
  
And he understood.  
He understood himself.  
Upon this  
He saw that when he was of anger  
Or knew hurt  
Or felt fear,  
It was because he was not understanding.  
And he learned, compassion.  
  
And with his eye of compassion  
He saw his enemies  
Like unto himself,  
And he learned love.  
Then, he was answered.  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start
