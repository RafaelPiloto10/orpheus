I use to think that love was just a fairy tale  
Until that first hello, until that first smile  
But if I had to do it all again  
I wouldn't change a thing  
'cause this love is everlasting  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
Ooh  
Girl you're everything a man could want and more  
A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside  
Holding hands as we walk along the shore  
Never felt like this before  
Now you're all I'm living for  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
Each day  
I pray  
This of love we feel will last forever  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
You're in love  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
