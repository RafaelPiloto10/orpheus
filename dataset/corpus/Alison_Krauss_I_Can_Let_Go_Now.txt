It was so right  
It was so wrong  
Almost at the same time  
The pain and ache  
A heart can take  
No one really knows  
But when the memories cling and take you there  
Till you no longer care  
You can let go now  
It's not right for me  
To cling to you  
Somehow I just needed time  
From what was to be  
It's not like me  
To hold somebody down  
But I was tossed high by love  
Almost never came down  
Only to land  
Where no love is found  
And I'm no longer bound  
I can let go now
