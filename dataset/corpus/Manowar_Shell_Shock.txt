I don't know  
Well there's no charge for the haircut  
And the bullets come free  
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:  
He's got a mission for me  
  
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger  
And I live in Saigon  
We've got a team of special forces  
And we deliver napalm  
  
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind  
Maybe it's not gone just a little hard to find  
About the time this letter gets home  
I'll be gone, gone, yeah gone  
  
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.  
Think a little less about me each day  
'Cause if I ever get back  
I'll be shell shocked  
  
Feels funny riding in my car  
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.  
I know I'm home  
But I feel gone,gone, yeah gone  
  
Now it's over and the homeland's safe  
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave  
The businessmen sat home  
Well I got shell shocked
