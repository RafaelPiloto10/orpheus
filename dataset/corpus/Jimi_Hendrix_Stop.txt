You better stop it babe  
You better stop it babe  
Stop your jivin' 'round  
Stop it baby  
Stop your doggin' 'round  
  
Stop  
Baby can't you see that I can't take it no more  
Stop  
Now baby can't you see I'm 'bout to go through the floor  
  
Never knew how good love could be  
Love done gone and made a damn fool of me  
Everything is hazy  
One more kiss and you drive me crazy baby  
  
Baby stop  
Hold it just a minute while I go catch my breath  
Stop  
Baby can't you see I'm bout to scare me half to death  
  
Thought I was the captain of my ship  
Oh yeah love has gone and made me lose my grip  
Everything is hazy  
One more kiss and you drive me crazy baby  
  
Stop, stop, stop, stop  
  
Stop  
Baby can't you see that I can't take it no more  
You know how I'm feelin' baby  
Stop  
Baby can't you see I'm bout to go through the floor  
  
Never knew how good love could be  
Love done gone and made a damn fool of me  
Everything is hazy  
One more kiss and you drive me crazy baby  
  
Stop, stop, stop, stop  
  
Your jivin' baby  
Your messin' around  
Until mornin' time  
  
Stop it baby  
Everyday, yeah  
Stop your jivin' around  
  
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
