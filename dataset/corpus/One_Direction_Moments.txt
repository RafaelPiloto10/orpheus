Shut the door  
Turn the light off  
If I wanna be with you  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna lay beside you  
I cannot hide this  
Even though I try  
  
Heartbeats harder  
Time escapes me  
Trembling hands touch skin  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Close the door  
Throw the key  
Don't wanna be reminded  
Don't wanna be seen  
Don't wanna be without you  
My judgement's clouded  
Like tonight's sky  
  
Hands are silent  
Voice's numb  
Try to scream out, my lungs  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face.  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Flashing lights in my mind  
Going back to the time  
Playing games in the street  
Kicking balls at my feet  
There's a numb in my toes  
Standing close to the edge  
There's a pile of my clothes  
At the end of your bed  
As I feel myself fall  
Make a joke of it all  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today
