I know what you want  
I'm gonna take you a midnight show tonight  
And if you keep a secret  
I got a blanket in the back seat of my mind  
And a little place that sits beneath the sky  
She turned her face to speak  
But no one heard her cry  
  
Drive faster, boy  
Drive faster, boy  
  
I know there's a hope  
There's too many people trying to help me cope  
You got a real short skirt  
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah  
  
We were just in time  
Let me take a little more off your mind  
There's something in my head  
Somewhere in the back said  
We were just a good thing  
We were such a good thing  
  
Make it go away without a word  
But promise me you'll stay  
Fix these things I've heard  
Or make it go away! Oh  
  
Drive faster, boy yo uh, oh no  
  
The crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl  
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls  
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier  
Of stars and atmosphere, and watched her  
And watched her disappear  
Into the midnight show  
  
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster  
Oh, no no no no no no, no no no no no  
If you keep a secret  
Well baby I can keep, if you can keep a secret  
(She said she loved me)  
If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret  
(She said she loved me)  
If you can keep a secret well baby I can keep it a secret
