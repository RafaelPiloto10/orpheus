Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Is a fairytale, they say  
He was made of snow but the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
Dns the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away"  
  
Down to the village  
With a brooomstick in his hand  
Running here and there, all around the square,  
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard him holler, "Stop!"  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day. "  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow  
  
He'll be back  
Yes he will  
Again someday  
See you next year Frosty!
