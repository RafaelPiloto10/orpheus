[Repeat: x3]  
Reap the wild wind  
  
A finger points to show a scene. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Another face where mine had been. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Another footstep where I once walked. (Take my hand)  
Take it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
You take my hand and give me your friendship.  
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply.  
Give me an inch and I'll make the best of it.  
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die.  
  
Reap the wild wind.  
  
A footprint haunts an empty floor. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
A fading coat that I once wore. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Oh, desolation where I once lived.  
I have seen in times gone by.  
I have felt a different shadow on the wall,  
A stranglehold on a certain feeling.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Reap the wild wind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Reap the wild wind.
