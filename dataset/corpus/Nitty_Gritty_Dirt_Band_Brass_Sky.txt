I gotta bent up truck, gotta fix-it-up  
So I set it on the backyard lawn  
Put the radio loud in the window  
I tuned it into rock  
Now I'm patiently waitin' on music  
But the dj rambled and sang  
And it was blowin' in a brass sky  
But it won't rain  
  
A bright-eyed woman on the hour  
Brings a glass of tea  
And I can tell she's as pretty as a flower  
When she comes to me  
She winds away the water  
From my eyes and soothes my brain  
And it was blowin' in a brass sky  
But it won't rain  
  
And it won't rain for tryin'  
And it won't rain for beans  
There's fear in the sky  
A big storm is what it means  
  
Waitin' out the weather  
By workin' on the truck  
We get to hang out together  
Can't believe this luck  
  
Glass is fine by the hour  
But don't match with mine  
It got wrecked playin' sailor in the shower  
Last Christmas time  
The song's written in another language  
But the weather forecast is plain  
It was blowin' in a brass sky  
But it won't rain  
  
And it won't rain for tryin'  
And it won't rain for beans  
Well it's a bad day for flyin'  
But they won't fly with me  
Starin' at the boats and planes  
That are stayin' on the ground  
Another won't leave it's hidin'  
Til the wind turns 'round  
  
A bright-eyed woman in the kitchen  
Cooks up a kiss of death  
Boilin' up mango, crab and coconut  
And includin' cinnamon bread  
But she drops the pan and says  
Paranoia is out and breeds like a runaway train  
And it was blowin' in a brass sky  
But it won't rain  
  
And it won't rain for tryin'  
And it won't rain for beans  
Well it's a bad day for flyin'  
They won't fly with me, no  
Starin' at the boats and planes  
Stayin' on the ground  
Another won't leave it's hidin'  
Til the wind turns 'round
