I've got a date with a dream  
A dream divine  
I've got a date with a dream  
Who may be mine  
  
I've got to hurry and dress  
To meet him at seven  
When any old corner becomes a corner  
Of heaven, blue heaven  
  
I'm gonna dance with a dream  
We'll dance on air  
I'm gonna speak to a dream  
And tell him I care  
  
And when the evening is over  
I'll kiss him goodnight and then  
I'll have a date with a dream  
And meet him all over again
