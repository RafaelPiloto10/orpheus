There's no need to hide anything  
Baby just know what you bring  
Will always be enough  
All of those things that you do  
Are the reasons that I fell for you  
And why, I believe in us  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby shoot straight from your heart  
You'll never miss your mark  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
Let truth be the path that you choose  
There ain't no way we can lose  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
  
We're gonna make some mistakes  
'Cause baby I sure ain't no saint  
I swear I'm in for the long haul  
It doesn't matter how far  
I love you just how you are  
I will answer when you call  
  
[Chorus]
