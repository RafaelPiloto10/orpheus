He-o he came walking down my street  
He-o and he stopped in front of my door  
He-o and he knocked on the door a long while  
He-o then he turned and he walked away  
He-o then he turned and he walked away  
He-o and he never came back again  
He-o I wasn't at home that day  
He-o and I never found out that he came
