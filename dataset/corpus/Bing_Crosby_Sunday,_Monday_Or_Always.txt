Sunday, Monday or Tuesday  
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday  
I want you near  
Every day in the year  
  
Oh, won't you tell me when  
We will meet again  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
If you're satisfied  
I'll be at your side  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
No need to tell me now  
What makes the world go 'round  
When at the sight of you  
My heart begins to pound and pound  
  
And what am I to do  
Can't I be with you  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
Always and forever I must be with you  
Beginning Sunday and Monday and then forever  
  
Oh, won't you tell me when  
We will meet again  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
If you're satisfied  
I'll be at your side  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
No need to tell me now  
What makes the world go 'round  
When at the sight of you  
My heart begins to pound, pound, pound  
  
What am I to do  
Can't I be with you  
Sunday, Monday or always
