Sleep little baby don't you fret  
Mamma's going to say a little prayer  
Then mamma's going to get some masking tape  
To fix the hole in the ozone layer  
  
Sleep little angel, baby dove  
Sun's gone down, it's getting late  
Mamma's got her chicken soup of love  
For the bad old world is sick with hate  
  
Wish that I could give you child  
All the beauty I have seen  
Mamma's going to sing you a melody  
That you can hum when you're alone  
  
Now you're in your cozy bed  
Sleep little angel, drop of mud  
There's a journey in your head  
And desert winds blow in your blood  
  
Wicked wold and wicked world  
Howling in the moonless sky  
But mamma's here to fend them off  
Hush little baby, don't you cry
