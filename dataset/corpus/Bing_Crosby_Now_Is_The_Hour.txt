Now is the hour  
When we must say goodbye.  
Soon you'll be sailing  
Far across the sea.  
  
While you're away  
Oh, then, remember me.  
When you return  
You'll find me waiting here.  
  
Sunset glow fades in the west.  
Night o'er the valley is creeping.  
Birds cuddle down in their nest  
Soon all the world will be sleeping.  
  
Now is the hour  
When we must goodbye.  
Soon you'll be sailing  
Far across the sea.  
  
While you're away  
Oh, then, remember me.  
When you return  
You'll find me waiting here.
