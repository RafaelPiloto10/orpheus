Homie lover friend is what I'm looking for,  
Some one who can relate to what I have in store,  
She can kick back with the homies, play the stake and getting played  
That down to earth gyirl from around the world hey  
We will be together for all times, I need a homie lover friend that will
always  
Be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
A hommie lover friend is what I'm looking for  
  
She can relate to my sex drive,  
Cuffing her booty while we dance and she don't mind  
She's got everything that a man could ever want and more  
Yes she does  
And her sexy gangsta way, she's got me all up in a day  
Homie lover friend is what I need for always  
  
[Chorus]  
  
she's the kinda lady that will do n e thing for me,  
That she truly loves yea she love  
Felloers you no she would, yea  
She s sum kind of sadie  
She will satisfy me
