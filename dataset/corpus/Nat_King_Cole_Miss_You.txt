(I miss you)  
(Since you went away dear)  
Miss you  
More than I can say dear  
  
Daytime  
Night-time nothing I do  
Can make me forget  
That I still love you  
  
(Miss you)  
In my dreams I kiss you  
Whispering  
Darling how I miss you  
  
Tell me  
Do you ever miss me?  
As I...  
Miss... you...  
  
(Kiss you)  
In my dreams I kiss you  
Whispering  
Darling how I miss you  
  
Tell me  
Do you ever miss me?  
As I...  
Miss... you...
