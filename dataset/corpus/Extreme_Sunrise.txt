She don't worry about tomorrow  
Nothing further from her mind  
She don't need to beg or borrow  
Time is on her side  
She like coloring the rainbow  
Never paint between the lines  
She like to chase away the shadow  
Watch them run and hide  
  
Kiss me in the morning  
Before I open up my eyes  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Sunrise  
  
See her dancing on the water  
Washing dreams upon the shore  
Heaven wanting you to call her  
Knocking at your door  
She my center of attention  
Nothing further from my mind  
Point me in the right direction  
Sunshine shine your light  
  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Before I open up my eyes  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Sunrise alright  
  
Sunrise kiss and I will follow  
Sunrise shine your light  
Sunrise filling up my hollow  
Sunrise sunrise  
Sunrise kiss and I will follow  
Sunrise shine your light  
Sunrise filling up my hollow  
Sunrise sunrise sunrise  
She helped me find my way
