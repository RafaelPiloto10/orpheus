There's no way to find out what's inside you  
Until you fall into the hole  
You dug for yourself while you slept here  
Too young, too selfish, too cold  
And when you find out what's been waiting  
The moment you open your eyes  
You'll see your true reflection  
The very first time in your life  
  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run  
  
Into the hole you fall deeper  
Deeper the faster you run  
It won't stop until you've accepted  
Accept everythng that you've done  
  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run
