Will you be my midnight dancer  
Any time of the day?  
You can be my sweet romancer  
I want to hear you say.  
When love's between us,  
Come on, baby, don't turn away.  
Don't let go.  
Love makes the music,  
You can't stop the feelin',  
Free will stealin' your heart away.  
Stealin' your heart away  
Love makes the music  
And you know it's the feelin'  
Free will stealin' your heart away.  
I want to steal your heart away.  
I'm tired of bein' a sleepwalker  
On the run,  
I want to be your love talker  
In the night, the sun.  
Oh, love makes the music,  
And you know it's the feelin'  
Free will stealin' your heart away  
Gonna steal your heart away.  
Now we can put our hearts together  
With nothin' to hide.  
Baby, it could last forever  
Put your ... aside.  
Love makes the music,  
And you know it's the feelin'  
Free will stealin' your heart away.  
I want to steal your heart away.
