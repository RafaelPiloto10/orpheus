If someone stood up in a crowd  
And raised his voice up way out loud  
And waved his arm  
And shook his leg  
You'd notice him  
  
If someone in a movie show  
Yelled "fire in the second row,  
This whole place is a powder keg! "  
You'd notice him  
  
And even without clucking like a hen  
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,  
Unless, of course, that personage should  
Be  
Invisible, inconsequential me!  
  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there!  
  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there. ..  
  
Suppose you was a little cat  
Residin' in a person's flat  
Who fed you fish and scratched your  
Ears?  
You'd notice him  
  
Suppoose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
You'd notice him  
  
A human being's made of more than air  
With all that bulk, you're bound to see  
Him there  
  
Unless that human bein' next to you  
Is unimpressive, undistinguished  
You know who. ..  
  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should I bend my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
Never even know I'm there
