Coming soon  
Something good  
Something we can share  
Understood  
Could be better news  
We can share  
Something's coming soon  
I hear it everywhere  
  
(live it) it's the story of our lives  
(come give it) it's the way we've always been  
(come give it) though the mountains may divide  
(come give it) we can reach the sea  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
In the air I can feel  
Something magical becoming real  
From the other side looking in  
Come on, throw the dice  
And tonight we'll win  
  
(live it) it's the story of our lives  
(come give it) it's the way we've always been  
(come give it) though the mountains may divide  
(come give it) we can reach the sea  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
Driving through the night  
Just you and me  
Faster than any light  
Something's calling (calling, calling)  
Calling us away  
Do you believe  
Heaven isn't that obvious  
We'll be there in a heartbeat  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem
