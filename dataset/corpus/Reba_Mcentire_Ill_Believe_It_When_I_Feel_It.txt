Now when you left everybody told me  
That I'd find another to take the place of you  
And they all said someone else would hold me  
And I'd have a lover to love like I loved you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll believe it when I feel it  
When somebody makes me feel the way you did  
They say he's out there  
They tell me someday I'll forget  
I'll believe it when I feel it  
But I haven't felt it yet  
  
I've heard in time  
Time is going to heal me  
It's been forever  
And I still need you now  
Maybe I will someday find that feeling  
We had together  
Oh but I've got my doubts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll believe it when I felt  
But I haven't felt it yet
