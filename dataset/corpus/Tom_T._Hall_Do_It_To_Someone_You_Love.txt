The words I love you come easy to the lips of a liar or a fool  
If love talking is what you're thinking of then do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love  
Some little things to let them know they're all you're thinking of  
This day and time a little thing you do could mean so much  
So do it to someone you love  
  
A smile comes easy to a strange hello to someone that you never met  
But an old love don't need that smile it glows with just a touch  
So do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love...
