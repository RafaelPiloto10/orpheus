The light  
Begin to bleed,  
Begin to breathe,  
Begin to speak.  
D'you know what?  
I love you better now.  
  
I am falling  
Like a stone,  
Like a storm,  
Being born again  
Into the sweet morning fog.  
D'you know what?  
I love you better now.  
  
I'm falling,  
And I'd love to hold you know.  
I'll kiss the ground.  
I'll tell my mother,  
I'll tell my father,  
I'll tell my loved one,  
I'll tell my brothers  
How much I love them.
