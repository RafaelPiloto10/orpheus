Once, as my heart remembers,  
All the stars were fallen embers.  
Once, when night seemed forever  
I was with you.  
  
Once, in the care of morning  
In the air was all belonging.  
Once, when that day was dawning  
I was with you.  
  
How far we are from morning,  
How far we are  
And the stars shining through the darkness,  
Falling in the air.  
  
Once, as the night was leaving  
Into us our dreams were weaving.  
Once, all dreams were worth keeping.  
I was with you.  
  
Once, when our hearts were singing,  
I was with you.
