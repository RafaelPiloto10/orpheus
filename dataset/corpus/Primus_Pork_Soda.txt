Now listen up you know ya come home from working that nine to five and  
Lay yourself down on burgundy couch, you know, it never really was  
Burgundy. It was red, and you painted with the goddamn sprinkler and  
Now you have bits and pieces of burgundy stuck to your but every time  
You get off of it. You never tell your family, you never tell your  
Family because, you know, ol' Junior, he's got no brains, and what can  
You do? What can you do? (And old Junior, you know, got a little crazy  
With that P.B.J. that one day ??)  
  
[Chorus]  
Grab yourself a can of pork soda  
You'll be feeling just fine  
Ain't nothin' quite like sittin' 'round the house  
Swillin' down them Cans of swine  
  
Ha ha ha! Yes, Dad's an idiot alright!  
  
Well, alright, I'm really starting to worry about you. You had to have  
That two-car garage with the large driveway so you could park that  
Goddamn boat in it. If it wasn't for the boat (blah blah blah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like Kansas wine  
  
Well, maybe it's something simpler, like your team lost or your  
Girlfriend used to be a guy, you know, I don't know. I mean (blah blah blah)
