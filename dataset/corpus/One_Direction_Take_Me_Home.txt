I got a lot on my plate  
So get off of my bag  
My worries are piling up  
And multiplying  
  
Ain't got a lot on  
My name and it disappears fast  
Well I should spend less  
I know I know I'm trying  
  
I can't afford to change myself  
For sleep almost every night  
So I should plan my  
Week accordingly so  
I'll feel alright  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
No I can not afford rent or to  
Call it I drive but I still got  
Champagne to help me not remember  
  
Sitting on a tall fence looking  
Down at both sides well I think  
I should just stay put and a have  
A fucking dinner. It's like all I do  
Just when I do when I need a friend  
  
Who ses I can't have everything  
I want and still eat my cake  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
Whenever hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older
