I am not so upset about my horrible self  
But why don't you go upset yourself  
Hey here's the mirror see your stupid face  
What a disgrace man and you know it's true  
  
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family  
Everyone's against me  
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family

Don't stare at me it's freakin' me out  
Look what's happening now it's all your fault  
You can't do nothin' absolutely nothing' o.k.  
Why don't you get a hoola hoop  
And do the cretin hop and  
  
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family  
Everyone's against me

It's nothin' gonna happen nothin' ever will  
You'll be miserable every day your luck will always be bad
