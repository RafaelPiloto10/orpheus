Living inside my head pulling my strings  
Letting me think I'm in control  
Giving you all of my heart was a good start  
But it turns out you want my soul  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
I'm tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
So tell me what you really want (really want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be, no I don't wanna be alone  
Ooh, alone now, oh yeah, don't wanna be  
  
(Uh) Pushing me over the edge  
Can't forget those things you said  
Cut to the bone  
Go ahead, take your swing  
What did you think?  
I was just gonna roll over,oh no  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all  
I'm tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
Gotta tell me what you really want (what you want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be  
No, I don't wanna be alone  
Ooh, alone now  
I don't wanna be  
  
I'm putting myself on the line  
And I'm tired of wasting my time  
There's got to be a reason why  
She will not talk to me  
  
No I, I don't know nothing 'bout that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
So tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
Oh yeah  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
So tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
  
Yeah tell me what you really want (what you want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be  
No, I don't wanna be alone  
Yeah, doin' everything so wrong
