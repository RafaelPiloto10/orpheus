Well the record company's goin' out of business  
They price the records too damn high  
And the boys in the band could use some assistance  
  
Well the record company's goin' out of business  
They price the records too damn high  
And the boys in the band could use some assistance  
Get a daytime job just to get by  
Well the P.D.'s they won't play the record  
They're too worried about that book  
And the D.J's they all hate the song  
But they're in love with the hook  
  
[Chorus:]  
So na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
I bet you've heard this song before  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Take your cocaine and hit the door  
  
Well folk rock, punk rock, power pop music  
Turned out to be the latest trends  
And ther ain't no more progressive music  
The business has put it to an end  
Ol' "Rolling Stone" has gathered some moss  
No they ain't what they used to be  
They try to look like "Look" with their political pages  
And advertising all over T.V.  
  
[Chorus]
