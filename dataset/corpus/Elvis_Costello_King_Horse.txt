Cheap cut satin and bad perfume  
Showtime is almost here  
Teased up by a strip cartoon  
Laughing up your sleeve  
Sniggering in your beer  
He'd seen the bottom of a lot of glasses  
But he'd never seen love so near  
He'd seen love get so expensive  
But he'd never seen love get so dear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I know that you're all King Horse  
Between tenderness and brute force (repeat)  
  
She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set  
Hit the bill, ring the bell, never spill a sip  
And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get  
A lot of loose exchanges, precious little respect  
When it's someone else's weekend  
That's the best you can expect  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So fond of the fabric  
So fond of fabrication  
From comic books to tragic  
Through the heart of complications  
Meanwhile back in some secluded spot  
He says 'will you please?' and she says 'stop'  
If I ever lose this good thing that I've got  
I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight  
'Cause I knew that song so long before we met  
That it means much more than it might  
  
[Chorus:]
