Every time you turn around  
You wear another face  
Every time i look away  
I find a hiding place  
  
If you knew me like you knew him  
You would know just how i feel  
Slipping through someone's fingers  
Falling under someone's wheels  
  
It's easier to walk away  
Better off to face the facts  
When love holds you up for ransom  
Walk away and don't look back  
  
Never seen you looking back through  
Smiling eyes and tears  
Never knew you holding on to  
Memories and fears  
  
Just release me i can't take it  
Can't you see a change has come  
Strangled by infatuation  
Buried under someone's thumb  
  
It's easier to walk away  
Cover and fade to black  
When love scars and leaves you branded  
Walk away and don't look back  
  
Every time you turn around  
You wear another face  
Every time i look away  
I find a hiding place
