(jose m. lavina)  
Still don't understand how love so strong  
Melts and fades away just like a song  
Can't explain how you and I would grow  
Now I'm alone, out on my own  
Chorus:  
Only you, light up my life, only you  
Night after night, only you  
Only your love feels so right  
Only you  
Yesterday when love we had was new  
No one in our world just me and you  
Take me back where you and I belong  
Where love was strong, it's been so long  
Only you, light up my life, only you  
Night after night, only you, only you  
Only your love feels so right  
Only you, light up my life, only you  
Night after night, only you, only you  
Only your love feels so right  
Changing my life, only you.
