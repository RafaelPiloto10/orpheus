Well my baby came at me with a 2x4  
So I fought her off with sandpaper  
It was 60 grit, it was really rough  
And it made a lot of sawdust  
But we patched things up with love and glue  
We went to the church and said "I do"  
Our honeymoon was at a hardware store  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Well I heard the train come rolling by  
With cattle on board, so we decided  
We should drop everything and hop that train  
And take a one-way trip to the slaughterhouse  
Well we stared at the cattle as they took the walk  
To meet the man who worked the saw  
We stared at the blood and the guts and the gore  
It looked an awful lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
We made love on a flat bed truck  
She worried about getting splinters in her butt  
I said don't think about those problems when we rut  
The deck's made of particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle board, you could make a dresser  
Or a shelf or a hutch or an ottoman  
You could leave it like it is or paint it up  
It's still gonna be made of particle board  
Particle board, it's useful stuff  
It's stronger than glue, it's better than fluff  
It sounds like a simile and that's enough  
To say that our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle Board!
