(Thiang)  
To prove we're not barbarians  
They dress us up like savages!  
To prove we're not barbarians  
We wear a funny skirt!  
Ah... H!  
  
(Wives)  
To prove we're not barbarians  
They dress us up like savages!  
To prove we're not barbarians  
We wear a funny skirt!  
  
(Thiang)  
Western People Funny,  
Western People Funny,  
Western People Funny,  
Of that there is no doubt,  
They feel so sentimental  
About the Oriental,  
They always try to turn us  
Inside down down and upside out!  
  
(Wives)  
Upside out and inside down!  
  
(Thiang)  
To brusie and pinch our little toes-  
Our feet are cramped in leather shoes-  
They'd break if we had brittle toes,  
But now they only hurt!  
Ah... H!  
  
(Wives)  
To bruise and pinch our little toes-  
Our feet are cramped in leather shoes,  
They'd break if we had brittle toes,  
But now they only hurt!  
Western People Funny!  
Western People Funny!  
Western People Funny!  
Too funny to be true!  
  
(Thiang)  
They think they civilise us Ah...  
Whenever they advise us  
To learn to make the same mistake  
That they are making too!  
... H!  
  
(All)  
They make quite A few!
