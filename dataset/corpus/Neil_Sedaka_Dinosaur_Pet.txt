I love, I love, I love my dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet  
I love, I love, I love my dinosaur pet  
Each and every day of the year  
January, he's breaking out of his shell  
February, he's body's starting to swell  
March, at least eight times a day he's got to be fed  
April, when he sleeps with me he crushes the bed  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
May, maybe if the roof was twice as tall  
June, he wouldn't bump it when he's roaming the hall  
July, like the fireworks he touches the sky  
August, the cost of groceries is bleeding us dry  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
September, just the tail alone is thirty feet long  
October, when we trick or treat he goes as King Kong  
November, fifty turkeys weren't nearly enough  
December, come the new year days are gonna get rough  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet
