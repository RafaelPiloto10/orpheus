Now it's the last time to remember what you said to me  
And I'm the last person in the world I thought I'd be  
And now it's high time to be something bigger than we are  
It's never too late to reverse a thing that's gone too far  
  
(1st Chorus)  
And I think the whole world's laughing at us  
But I don't care, that's not the point  
There's so much more  
There's so much more than meets the eye  
Oh, when you're around I'm blind  
  
Now it's the last time to leave the shadows far behind  
And it's the last time to clear the cobwebs from our mind  
And it's the last time to bury all our memories  
And it's the last time before everything just fades away  
  
(2nd Chorus)  
And I wish that you were here with me  
And I wish that somehow things would change  
You'd lose your fear of me  
And I feel that things might be okay  
Oh, wouldn't that be strange  
  
Now it's the last time to reconsider what we've done  
And it's the last time to start all over from day one  
  
(Repeat 2nd Chorus)  
  
(Repeat 1st Chorus)
