Stay with me a while  
Rise above the vile  
Name my final rest  
Pored into my chest  
  
Chorus:  
Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate  
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait  
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead  
Halo of death, all I see is departure  
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr  
  
Pledge yourself to me  
Never leave me be  
Sweat breaks on my brow  
Given time ends now  
  
Chorus  
  
Spirit painted sin  
Embers 'neath my skin  
Veiled in pale embrace  
Reached and touched my face  
  
Chorus
