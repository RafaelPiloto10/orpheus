When I pretend  
Everything is what I want it to be  
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see  
When I pretend  
I can forget about the criminal I am  
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can, but  
I can't pretend this is the way it will stay, I'm just  
Trying to bend the truth  
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be  
So I'm  
Lying my way from you  
  
(no, no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
I remember what they taught to me  
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be  
Remember listening to all of that and this again  
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in  
And now you think this person really is me and I'm  
(trying to bend the truth)  
But the more I push  
The more I'm pulling away  
'cause I'm  
  
Lying my way from you  
  
(no, no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
You  
(no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me
