Scared and lonely  
Going out for the night  
Shakin' all over  
And wishing I'd never  
Come here  
  
He pulled up in a cloud of smoke  
So much was said  
But nobody spoke a word  
  
So I took a chance  
And he followed me home  
I knew he wouldn't beg  
So I gave in without fighting  
  
Been so long since I've been this way  
Since I loved this way  
So I asked him if he would stay for a while  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
We talked a while  
And he told me nice  
We laughed and we cried and  
I knew that I could love him  
He got up to say goodbye  
I said where you going,  
He said that he must leave  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky takes you out for a ride  
For a ride  
Lucky takes you out for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
  
Lucky come easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride
