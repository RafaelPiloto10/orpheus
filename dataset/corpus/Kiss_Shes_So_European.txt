She walked in like a lady, with a glass of pink champagne  
I wouldn't look if you paid me, 'cause to me she's still the same  
Well you oughtta see her, wearin' her heart on her sleeves  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned look in her eyes  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, one of a kind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, I found out today  
  
She still speaks with an accent from a week in San Tropez  
She makes love on her brass bed 'cause her parents are still away  
Well you oughta see her, countin' the stars in her eyes  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned coverless smile  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, she told me today  
  
I wanna hold her tight all through the night, I must be dreamin'  
I wanna take my time, she's so refined, is that her screamin'  
  
I've seen the looks in your eyes, you've seen through her disguise, yeah  
  
She's so European, she's so European, one of a kind, all in her mind...
