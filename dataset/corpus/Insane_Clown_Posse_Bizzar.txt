Then I'd have to attack

Slappin' ninjas out of hidin' spots

Wicked wild, give it to me,give it to me  
Been waggling my dick since the seventh grade  
Freak Show grabbin' my balls and gettin' paid  
As my old bitch,we don't play  
Hair wigged out and my eyes all gray  
No more rappin', no more shows  
I'm goin' back to school and workin' at Kinkos  
I'll ride around all dayon a mountain bike all day  
Hey!(honk) I got the right of way  
Stab, shoot, chop, cut, drill

No matter where you go motherfucker Dark Carnival ain't far  
And it's plain Bizzar

Fuck everybody on the dance floor  
If you ever had to fuck a fat bitch in the mouth say-  
Fuck everybody on the dance floor
