You can go to the east to find your  
Your inner hemisphere  
You say we're under the same sky babe  
Your bound to realize honey it's not that clear  
I'm not your promised land oh no  
I'm not your promised one  
I'm not the land of Canaan sweetheart  
Waiting for you under the sun  
  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm missing you now  
I'm wanting your love  
And you're giving it out  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
  
Well, the meanings changed  
For what it's worth  
It's just a senseless game  
Well I should think of love  
But it's fear every time I hear  
Honey your heartbeat strain  
It's not the fallen man  
It's not the call of time  
It's just the London skyline sweetheart  
Telling me you're not mine  
  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm missing you now  
I'm wanting your love  
And you're giving it out  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
  
My blood is running dry  
My skin is, my skin is growing thin  
For every time you find yourself  
You loose a little bit of me honey from within  
It's just a raging cycle  
Why can't we bring it all to the end of the line  
From inside this existence, sweetheart  
Time is not on my side  
  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm missing you now  
I'm wanting your love  
And you're giving it out  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
I'm lonely tonight  
  
I'm not your promised land  
(I'm lonely tonight)  
I'm not your promised one  
(Honey I'm trying to tell you that I'm lonely tonight)  
I'm not your promised land  
I'm not your promised one  
I'm not the land of Canaan  
(I'm lonely tonight)  
I'm not your land of Canaan  
(I'm lonely tonight)  
I'm not the land of Canaan sweetheart  
Waiting for you under the sun  
I'm lonely tonight
