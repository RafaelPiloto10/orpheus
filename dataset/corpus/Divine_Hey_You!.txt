I want a sure shot, worm that's going tough  
I want a sure shot, who'll love me when I'm rough  
I want a sure shot, fireing through the night  
I want a sure shot, who'll always do it right.  
  
Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire  
Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire  
  
(repeat)  
  
Hey you! Get on the floor, it's only natural love  
Hey you! I'm getting hot, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Spin around, it's only natural love  
Hey you! It's only natural love.  
  
I want a sure shot, worm that's going tough  
I want a sure shot, who'll love me when I'm rough  
I want a sure shot, fireing through the night  
I want a sure shot, who'll always do it right.  
  
Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire  
Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire  
  
Hey you! Tantilize, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Mesmorize, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Satisfy, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Get on the floor, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Spin around around, it's only natural love!  
  
Take your time, harden up, it's only natural love  
Take your time, you'll feel sublime, it's only natural love  
Take your time, you're doing fine, it's only natural love.
