Eyes  
Holdin' back the tears  
That they've held for years  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to make you cry  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
Days  
Where'd you go so fast  
Fin'lly lost at last  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?
