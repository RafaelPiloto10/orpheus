Well he used to be mine  
Not so very long ago  
I was crazy to ever let him get away  
But girl you should know better  
Then to go braggin' in my face  
So forgive me for what I'm 'bout to say  
  
Big deal  
So what? Who cares?  
Ya just got lucky that's all it was  
Shut up  
Don't want a hear another word about  
Candlelight and long stem roses  
And how you're fallin' head over heels  
In love, so what?  
Big deal  
  
He's perfect, I heard ya  
The first ten times that ya told me  
Yeah, yeah, it's amazin' his lovin'  
I can't believe I let him go  
I regret it, there I said it  
Ya call yourself a friend  
But ya just keep rubbin' it in  
  
Big deal  
So what? Who cares?  
Ya just got lucky that's all it was  
I swear if I hear another word about  
Candlelight or long stem roses  
And how you're fallin' head over heels  
In love, so what?  
Big deal  
  
Congratulations, I'm just so happy for you  
I can't contain the way I feel  
  
Big deal, big deal  
So what? Who cares?  
Ya just got lucky that's all it was  
Shut up  
Don't want a hear another word about  
Candlelight and long stem roses  
And how you're fallin' head over heels  
In love, so what?  
Big deal  
In love, so what?  
Big deal  
  
Ha ha it's a real big deal  
Oh yeah  
Ha ha it's a real big deal  
Big deal  
Ha ha it's a real big deal  
In love, so what?  
Shut up  
Ha ha it's a real big deal
