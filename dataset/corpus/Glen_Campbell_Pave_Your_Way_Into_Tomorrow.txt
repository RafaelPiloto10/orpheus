Pave your way into tomorrow  
  
Living for today is part of living for tomorrow  
For tomorrow's something we all have to find  
It's blanket black at midnight  
So your faith must be your night-light  
To erase the fear of darkness from your mind  
You have to pave your way into tomorrow  
You've got to live and let your brother live as well  
You've got to pave your way into tomorrow  
And let your love of living cast it's spell  
  
Gentle raindrops, falling people streams that keep on growing  
Till they build a raging river deep and wide  
Life's just a big river and if each man is a giver  
We might help to make the ocean satisfied  
You've got to pave your way into tomorrow...  
You've got to live and let your brother live as well  
You've got to pave your way into tomorrow  
And let your love of living cast it's spell  
And let your love of living cast it's spell
