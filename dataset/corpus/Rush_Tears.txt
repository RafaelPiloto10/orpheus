All of the seasons  
And all of the days  
All of the reasons  
Why I've felt this way  
So long  
So long  
  
Then lost in that feeling  
I looked in your eyes  
I noticed emotion  
And that you had cried  
For me  
I can see  
  
What would touch me deeper  
Tears that fall from eyes  
That only cry?  
Would it touch you deeper  
Than tears that fall from eyes  
That know why?  
  
A lifetime of questions  
Tears on your cheek  
I tasted the answers  
And my body was weak  
For you  
The truth
