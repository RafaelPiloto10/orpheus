I don't give a damn how it's supposed to be  
That might work for you, it don't work for me  
You write your truth and I'll write mine  
One man's ceiling's another man's sky high  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Crying like the lonely whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
Spit in the eye of a hurricane  
Who said life has got to be so cruel  
Love's the only rule  
  
It's written in the stars where I fit in  
It's going to hurt sometimes, you got to lose to win  
You got your sins and I got mine  
Sell your secrets, kiss them all goodbye  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like it's a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
Think about it, wouldn't that be cool?  
Love's the only rule  
  
Might be a wrecking ball  
Or just a wake up call  
Don't matter where the pieces fall  
  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
  
I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane  
Cry like the whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
I'm alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like its a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
  
Where love, love's the only rule  
Yes love, love's the only rule
