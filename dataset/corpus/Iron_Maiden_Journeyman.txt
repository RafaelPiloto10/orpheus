From the red sky of the east  
To the sunset in the west  
We have cheated death  
And he has cheated us  
  
But that was just a dream  
And this is what it means  
We are sleeping  
And we'll dream for evermore  
  
And the fragment remains of our memories  
And the shadows remain with our hands  
Deep gray, came to mourn  
All the colors of the dawn  
Will this journeyman's day be his last?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
  
But the memory still remains  
All the past years not so strange  
Our winter times are like a silent shroud  
And the heartbeat of the day  
Drives the mist away  
And winter's not the only dream around  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun  
  
[Chorus]
