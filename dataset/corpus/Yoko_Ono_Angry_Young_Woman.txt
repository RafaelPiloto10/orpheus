Angry young woman on sunrise strip,  
Walking away to the new world.  
She left her man, she left her children,  
Cause she knows she has only one life to live.  
  
Angry young woman with her background on her forehead,  
"Three children and two abortions."  
"Played a little piano ten years ago."  
"And some typing from the college where she met her husband."  
  
Angry young woman in the dark of the night,  
Hears her children crying for dinner,  
Hears her man shouting for his shirt  
And thinks of the first sundays they spent in the park.  
  
Angry young woman, angry young woman,  
There's no way back, so just keep walking.  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket  
And when you turn the corner you'll see the new world.  
  
Angry young woman, angry young woman,  
There's no way back, so just keep walking.  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket  
And when you turn the corner you'll see the new world.  
  
(Angry young woman, angry young woman,  
There's no way back, so just keep walking.  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket)  
  
(Angry young woman, angry young woman)
