Little black dress  
Just walked into the room  
Makin' heads turn  
Can't stop looking at you  
It's so right  
It's so right  
It's so right you know  
  
Little black dress  
Did you come here alone?  
It's too late  
It's too late  
It's too late to go home  
  
It's so right  
It's so right  
It's so right you know  
It's so right  
It's so right  
It's so right you know  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
Little black dress  
Who you doin' it for?  
Little black dress  
I can't take anymore  
It's not right  
It's not right  
It's not right you know  
  
Little black dress  
What's your favorite song?  
Little black dress  
I won't do you no harm  
  
It's so right  
It's so right  
It's so right you know  
It's so right  
It's so right  
'Cause I'll take you home  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me  
  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me baby  
I wanna see the way you move for me
