Hey this won't take much time  
We won't touch, we'll just wait for signs  
And nothing was further from my mind  
Than this moment with you  
  
But if you'd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If I'd only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
I know that is wrong  
But "if you need me, I'm here", turns me on  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
  
Say, you don't waste much time  
We don't touch, do we baby?  
But still my hands are tied  
For that moment with you  
  
But if you'd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If I'd only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
You know that I'm strong  
And I've no reason to fear, am I wrong?  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
  
You can't keep holding it in when it's something good  
(Get up, get up)  
You can't keep holding it in when it's something good  
(Get up, get up)  
  
And who can you trust?  
Dealing out justice with a minimum of fuss  
Who baby  
Dealing out justice...
