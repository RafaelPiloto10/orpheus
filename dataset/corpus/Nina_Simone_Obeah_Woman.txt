Obeah woman  
Yes, I'm the Obeah woman  
Do you know what one is?  
Ha do you know what an Obeah woman is?  
I'm the Obeah woman from beneath the sea  
To get to Satan you gotta pass through me  
'Cause I know the angels name by name  
I can eat thunder and drink the rain  
Been through enough  
Yeah they call me Nita and Pisces too  
There ain't nothing that I can't do  
If I choose to, if you let me  
  
Ha I'm the Obeah woman, above pain  
I can eat thunder and drink the rain  
I kiss the moon and hug the sun  
And call the spirits and make 'em run  
You hear me?  
You hear me?  
'Cause I ain't praying, never was  
Just waiting for my time  
Waiting for to die  
Hackle and patience  
Hackle and patience oh yeah  
  
Obeah now  
Obeah Obeah now  
I'm the Obeah woman from beneath the sea  
To get to Satan baby you gotta pass through me  
I know the angels name by name  
I can eat thunder and drink the rain  
How you think I lasted this long?  
Alright, alright  
I kiss the moon and hug the sun  
O yeah oh well oh well  
You people from the islands  
Know about the Obeah woman  
I didn't put the name on myself  
And I don't like it  
Sometimes, but the weight is too heavy  
The weight is too heavy  
Let' finish it
