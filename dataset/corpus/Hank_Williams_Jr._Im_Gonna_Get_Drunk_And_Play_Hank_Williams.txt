My good gal left and I can't stand this pain  
When she walked out my teardrops fell like rain  
So set 'em up Joe and give me some dimes  
I've got an appointment with a friend of mine  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
'Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill ain't got no sympathy  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
The moanin' blues and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
But lovesick blues sure ain't no state of mind  
Mixed with broken heart and Juke joint wine  
But I ain't leavin', done turned in my keys,  
The bartender told me stay as long as you please  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Ah 'cause those wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill ain't got no sympathy  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
'Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
Long gone lonesome blues sure fits me to a tee  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Why don't you love me like you used to do  
Yeah all night long
