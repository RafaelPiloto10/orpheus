Hey  
I'm your life  
I'm the one who takes you there  
I'm your life  
I'm the one who cares  
They  
They betray  
I'm your only true friend now  
They  
They'll betray  
I'm forever there  
  
I'm your dream, make you real  
I'm your eyes when you must steal  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
Sad but true  
I'm your dream, mind astray  
I'm your eyes while you're away  
I'm your pain while you repay  
You know it's sad but true  
  
You  
You're my mask  
You're my cover, my shelter  
You  
You're my mask  
You're the one who's blamed  
  
Do  
Do my work  
Do my dirty work, scapegoat  
Do  
Do my deeds  
For you're the one who's shamed  
  
I'm your dream, make you real  
I'm your eyes when you must steal  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
Sad but true  
I'm your dream, mind astray  
I'm your eyes while you're away  
I'm your pain while you repay  
You know it's sad but true  
  
I'm your dream.  
I'm your eyes.  
I'm your pain.  
I'm your dream.  
I'm your eyes.  
I'm your pain.  
You know it's sad but true  
  
Hate  
I'm your hate  
I'm your hate when you want love  
Pay  
Pay the price  
Pay, for nothing's fair  
  
Hey  
I'm your life  
I'm the one who took you here  
Hey  
I'm your life  
And I no longer care  
  
I'm your dream, make you real  
I'm your eyes when you must steal  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
Sad but true  
I'm your truth, telling lies  
I'm your reasoned alibis  
I'm inside open your eyes  
I'm you  
Sad but true
