  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'  
Come on, come on, come on everybody  
Come on, come on everybody  
Come on everybody, come on, come on everybody  
Come on, come on everybody  
Let's do this dance  
Get out your seats and let me shake your pants  
Oh, with the base cold thumpin' and the hihats snaren'  
People are jumpin' and the fly girls are staren'  
People under 40...Yo! Let's get down  
Because they need more break and now it's sliced by Shay  
The records out so don't wait  
The style that I'm doin', it'll ruin  
All you people came here just for booin'  
Get your dead ass up and back on the floor  
Jump in the groove and let Vanilla go  
Insane, with my gold chain  
You know you're gonna' see it on Soul Train. Hit it!  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..  
All you people on thel eft, shake your thing  
And everybody on the right, do the same thing  
Now, the people in the middle, try to enhance  
Come on everybody, let me see you dance  
In motion, with the potion  
Get up everybody and locomotion  
All swing and do your thing  
Unless of course, you can't hang. Chillin' is o.k  
But not when I play this song, move along, be gone  
Yea! The beat'll make you move when the records on  
Get with this style and update it  
Like my record is, when you play it  
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador  
I saw my style, my soul up on the dance floor  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Do it! Funk it up!  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..  
Swingin' until the night is through  
Just let your feet and your body take control of you  
Just like a trance to keep you movin'  
Everybody can do it, just keep on groovin'  
Of the 808...just kickin' like a chicken that you just ate  
So catch a groove so we can get down  
Yell out the name of your hometown  
Miami...Catch the groove. L.A....Catch the groove  
New York...Catch the groove. Seattle...Catch the groove  
Dallas...Catch the groove. Detroit...Catch the groove  
VIP dancers...Catch the groove. Everybody...Catch the groove  
Do it!  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Yea! Can we do it?  
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Come on everybody..
