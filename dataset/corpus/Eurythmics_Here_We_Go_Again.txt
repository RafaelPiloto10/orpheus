I once knew a pony  
Whose name was Survival  
He died in the winter of a happy revolution  
There were militant marches  
Over his dead body  
Children were crying and begging for mercy  
One  
Here we go again  
Two  
Here we go again  
We're all gonna be history  
Three  
Here we go again  
She's turning and turning, our American Sister  
Hands full of arrows and paperback bibles  
Like a boxing hero  
She stands in the ashes  
The voice of Martin Luther  
Through the radio flashes  
One  
Here we go again  
Two  
Here we go again  
We're all gonna be history  
Three  
Here we go again  
Oh here we go again  
Black snow in the fields again  
But tell me where is the friendship train?  
It's been a long time coming  
I once knew a pony  
Name was religion  
Head full of hatred and misguided morals  
He was blinded from reading  
Worn out and bleeding  
But he'll never give in, no  
Till the day he stops breathing  
Devil in the kitchen and the clock strikes nine  
His words are spoken in a voice sublime  
Apocalypse then and misery now  
Nothing you do is going to work anyhow boy  
One  
Here we go again  
Two  
Here we go again  
We're all gonna be history  
Three  
Here we go again
