We don't play any games, my girl and I  
We get by on the high of love  
And there's no time to spend on doubt or wondering  
'Cause no one else could I ever love  
You see the world outside can be cold and very lonely  
And it gets real bad  
And it makes me sad, but  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
We all live in a crazy world today  
There's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain  
And we'd be wiser to make a change, with love we could  
It's our world, we should make it good  
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely  
And it gets real bad  
It'll still make us sad  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
Our love is out world  
And it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us  
We look out from inside  
And depending on what we see  
We just hold each other tightly, hold me tightly  
'Cause sometimes it's just better to let it be  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die
