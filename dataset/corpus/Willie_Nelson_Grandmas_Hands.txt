Grandma's hands  
Clapped in church on Sunday morning  
Grandma's hands  
Played a tambourine so well  
Grandma's hands  
Used to issue out a warning  
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast  
Might fall on a piece of glass  
"Might be snakes there in that grass"  
Grandma's hands  
  
Grandma's hands  
Soothed a local unwed mother  
Grandma's hands  
Used to ache sometimes and swell  
Grandma's hands  
Used to lift her face and tell her,  
"Baby, Grandma understands  
That you really love that man  
Put yourself in Jesus hands"  
Grandma's hands  
  
Grandma's hands  
Used to hand me piece of candy  
Grandma's hands  
Picked me up each time I fell  
Grandma's hands  
Boy, they really came in handy  
She'd say, "Matty don' you whip that boy  
What you want to spank him for?  
He didn't drop no apple core"  
But I don't have Grandma anymore  
  
If I get to Heaven I'll look for  
Grandma's hands
