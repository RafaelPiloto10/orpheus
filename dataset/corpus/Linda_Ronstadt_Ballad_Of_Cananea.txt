I'm going to detail  
What happened to me,  
That they have taken me prisoner  
Being a well played rooster.  
(Even though I've been around and  
Should have known better.)  
  
I went to Agua Prieta  
To see if I had a reputation there  
And at 11: 00 at night  
The police apprehended me.  
  
They arrested me  
In the American style,  
As though I were a criminal  
All of them with pistol in hand.  
  
The jail of Cananea  
Is situated on a plateau  
And in it I was processed  
On account of my stupidity.  
  
I give you no farewell  
For I don't have it with me  
Leave it to the Holy Child  
And to the Lord of Mapimi
