Kindness  
In your eyes  
I guess  
You heard me cry  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
I'm blessed  
I know  
Heaven sent  
And Heaven stole  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
And what have I learned  
From all this pain  
I thought I'd never feel the same  
About anyone  
Or anything again  
  
But now I know  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
  
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
  
Sadness  
In my eyes  
No one guessed  
Or no one tried  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
Loveless and cold  
With your last breath  
You saved my soul  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
And what have I learned  
From all these tears  
I've waited for you all those years  
And just when it began  
He took you away  
  
But I still say  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
  
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
  
So the words you could not say  
I'll sing them for you  
And the love we would have made  
I'll make it for two  
  
For every single memory  
Has become a part of me  
You will always be  
My love  
  
Well I've been loved  
So I know just what love is  
And the lover that I kissed  
Is always by my side  
  
Oh the lover I still miss  
Was Jesus to a child
