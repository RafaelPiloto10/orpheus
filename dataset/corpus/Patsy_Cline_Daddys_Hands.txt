(feat. Loretta Lynn)  
  
I remember daddy's hands folded silently in prayer  
And reachin' out to hold me, when I had a nightmare  
You could read quite a story in the callous' and lines  
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind  
  
Verse 2  
I remember daddy's hands how they held my mama tight  
And patted my back for something done right  
There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the man  
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands  
  
Chorus  
Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'  
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong  
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand  
There was always love in daddy's hands.  
  
Verse 3  
I remember daddy's hands workin' 'til they bled  
Sacrifised unselfishly just to keep us all fed  
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again  
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands  
  
Repeat chorus
