I try with all my might but still don't understand  
Why we ever let it get so out of hand  
My arms are reaching out and holding on tight  
To what has always felt so right  
  
[Chorus]  
One is breaking into two  
And my heart is turning blue  
And you still don't get it do you  
I thought we had all the love  
To go it for the long run  
So before the damage is done  
Let's start back over at one  
  
Lights out when every evening used to get so hot, now  
We got so damned distracted we forgot how  
To lock the world away and just get lost in  
Where you end and where I begin  
Love is strong but it's so easy to divide  
So boy let's think about how much is on the line  
  
[Chorus]
