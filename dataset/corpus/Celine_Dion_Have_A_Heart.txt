Lying in bed alone  
Thinkin' bout how much I need you  
Oh give me one more chance  
To see you again  
  
If only I'd have known  
Was the last time I'd be with you  
I would have held on  
And never let you go  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
I'm begging you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Here comes another day  
I don't know if I can make it  
Oh, I've just realized  
Its so lonely being free  
  
Runnin' from the pain  
I'm never gonna shake it  
Oh how I need you  
To take it from me, baby  
  
Baby just have a heart  
I'm beggin' you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I always thought that I would have the  
Upper hand, but now I know that I'm  
Really not that strong  
If I could only make you understand  
I'd give you the world  
But for a start  
  
Baby just have a heart
