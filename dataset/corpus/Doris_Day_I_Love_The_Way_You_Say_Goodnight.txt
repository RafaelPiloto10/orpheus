(I love the way  
You say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way  
You mumble  
While you fumble for the key  
More time for kissing me  
(I love the way  
You say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you  
Linger with your finger  
On the bell  
More kisses  
And they're swell  
When you say  
Gotta get home by twelve  
I always say let's go  
'Cuz you can take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
(Both)  
I love the way  
You say goodnight  
I kinda like the way  
You snuggle  
While you juggle  
With your comb  
Mmmmmm  
I'm never  
Never, never going home  
  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way)  
You say  
(The way you always say)  
Goodnight  
(The way you always  
Whisper honey nighty night)  
The way  
You let our kisses mingle  
'Til I tingle to my toes  
(Giggle  
We're blushing like a rose)  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way  
The extraordinary way)  
You say good night  
(The way you always say  
Don't go just hold me tight)  
I kinda like the way you giggle  
While you jiggle with your bag  
(Sign  
Our heart's are playing tag)  
When you say  
(We just got to be home by twelve)  
But don't I always say let's go  
'Cause you take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way) you say  
(The super duper special way)  
Goodnight  
(The way you have me flying  
Higher than a kite)  
I kinda like the way you snuggle  
While you juggle with your comb  
(It looks as though  
You're never going)  
No I'm never, never, never  
Never, never, never gonna go home
