You gotta believe we can change the world  
Don't turn a blind eye to tomorrow's world  
But on the good side looking out  
Don't take for granted the silent shout  
The hands of time are rolling past  
To turn the tide, we must move fast  
Let's share the hope and pull some strings  
We hold the answer this vision sings  
They're holding on  
But for how long  
Let's set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, time to make a plan, don't sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
It's not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands  
Oh yeah  
We're three steps down, you're two steps back  
No more widgin' and that's a fact  
A call to arms, let's take a stand  
It's up to you to lend a helping hand  
They're holding on  
But for how long  
Let's set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, time to make a plan, don't sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
It's not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands, yeah  
We're the thunder in the storm  
That brings the winds of change  
Together we can overcome  
And start a brand new day  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival (Yeah yeah)  
Gotta take a stand, it's time to make a plan, don't sit idle (No, no, no, no)  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, c'mon make a plan, don't sit idle (Oh!)
