(Rodney Crowell)  
  
In this modern world we're livin'  
The rules ain't like they've ever been  
Speakin' of spreading it thin  
That's what you do, flashing your soul  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act with feelings  
Baby, better start turnin' em down  
  
Now it's a brave new wave we're roarin' in  
Hanging out, out on the rock 'n roll fringe  
Speaking of running around  
All over town, lettin' it show  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act in public  
Baby, don't better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down  
  
Sure is clear ain't nothin' easy any more  
Sure gets cloudy when I look in all directions  
Sure is rainin' like this feeling in my heart  
Sure is crazy how you're acting  
  
In this latest craze or current trend  
Burnin' money every way that you can  
Speakin' of goin' for broke  
That's how it is and lettin' it slow  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act with strangers  
Baby, you'd better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down  
  
Baby, better start turnin'  
Baby, better start turnin' 'em down  
Baby, better start turnin'
