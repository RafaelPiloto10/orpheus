He was too good to me how can I get along now  
So close he stood to me  
Everything is all messed up and wrong now  
My baby would have brought me the sun  
Cos making me smile that was his fun  
  
When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now  
You see I was his queen to him  
Who's gonna make me gay now  
It's only natural that I'm blue  
Cos my baby was too good to be true  
  
I said he was too good to me how am I ever get along now  
So close he stood to me  
Everything's all messed up and wrong now  
He would have brought me the sun and the moon  
Cos anytime I left him it was too soon  
  
When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now  
I was his queen to him who's gonna make me gay now  
It's only natural said it's only natural that I'm so blue  
He was too good to be true
