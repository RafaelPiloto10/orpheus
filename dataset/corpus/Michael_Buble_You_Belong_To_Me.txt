See the pyramids along the Nile  
See the sunrise on a tropic isle  
Just remember darlin' all the while  
You belong to me  
  
See the market place in Old Algiers  
Send me photographs and souvenirs  
Just remember when a dream appears  
You belong to me  
  
I'll be so alone without you  
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me
