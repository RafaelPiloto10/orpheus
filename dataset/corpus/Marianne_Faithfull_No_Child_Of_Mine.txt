You are my child and how you've grown  
But there are things that you must learn  
That every man must stand alone  
And family you must disown  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
  
Don't cry my child, you must know  
That every man I've ever loved  
Has been a child and fatherless  
Trust in yourself, it's all that you can trust  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go try, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
  
I have no time for hate or love  
Hey child, you're so full of woe  
I have no time for hate or lying  
Hey child, you're no child of mine  
  
I have no time for hate or love  
Hey child, you're so full of woe  
I have no time for hate or lying  
Hey child, you're no child of mine  
  
Hey child, you're no child of mine  
Hey child, you're no child of mine
