Down in vineland there's a clubhouse,  
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff  
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join  
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor  
Don't you see when you're looking at me  
That I'll never end transcend transcend  
Ain't it strange oh oh oh  
Ain't it strange oh oh oh  
  
Come and join me, I implore thee,  
I impure thee, come explore me.  
Oh, don't you know that anyone can come  
And they come and they call and they crawl on the floor.  
Don't you see when you're looking at me  
That I'll never end transcend transcend  
Ain't it strange oh oh oh

Do you go to the temple tonight ?  
Oh no, I don't think so  
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me marie?  
Oh no, I don't think so, no  
See when they offer me book of gold,  
I know soon still that platinum is coming  
And when I look inside of your temple  
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,  
And when he beckons his finger to me,  
Well, I move in another direction,  
I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension oh oh oh  
  
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter  
Hand of god, I feel the finger,  
Hand of god, and I start to whirl  
And I whirl, and I whirl,  
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,  
Turn, god, God (strange)  
Go, go on, go like a dervish,  
Turn, god, (strange) make a move  
Turn, lord, (strange)  
I don't get nervous  
Oh I just move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension  
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh  
Strange strange  
  
Do you go to the temple tonight ?  
Oh no, I don't think so, no  
We'll go to the pagoda  
The palace of answers with me, marie  
Oh no, I don't believe so, no  
See when they offer me book of gold,  
I know soon still that platinum is coming  
And when I look inside of your temple  
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man  
And when he beckons his finger to me,  
Well, I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension  
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
