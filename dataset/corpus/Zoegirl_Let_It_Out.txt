This life we lead is never boring  
New things come with every morning  
Every day is a second chance  
The start of a divine romance  
Take a breath and jump right in  
Let it out  
Tell the world what you're about  
Let them hear your screams, your shouts (out loud!)  
Don't hold back, don't let down  
It's all or nothing now  
Something's changing deep inside me  
I'm letting go of all I'm hiding  
I'm in over my head  
But I'm not afraid  
To dive in deep and make some waves  
No type of inquisition  
Could ever make me change my position  
I've told you before  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout some more
