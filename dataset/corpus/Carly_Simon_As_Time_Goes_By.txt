You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say I love you  
On that you can rely  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and lovesongs never out of date  
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
It's still the same old story  
The fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by
