Your name, your name  
Your name, your name

Hey there baby are you feelin' down?  
'Cause you've got nobody's arms  
To wrap your arms around  
Are you thinking what you're looking for  
Just can't be found  
If a part time heart is what you need  
What you want now baby  
You won't get from me  
If sometime love you're looking for  
Darlin' don't be knockin' on my door  
If you need someone  
To stand there beside you  
If you want love that's true  
I got a heart with your name on it, name on it  
I got love I got love I got love for you  
I got a heart put your claim on it, claim on it  
This heart will, this heart will beat for you  
If you want it to  
Love is waiting in these arms of mine  
If you're looking for a love that's the forever kind  
Baby you don't have to look no more  
Look in my eyes  
If you want somebody you can hold  
I'll be the one who'll never let you go  
If you want somebody who will stay  
I'll be the one who'll never walk away  
If you need someone  
To stand there beside you  
Nothin' less is gonna do  
I got a heart with your name on it, name on it  
I got love, I got love, I got love for you  
I got a heart put your claim on it, claim on it  
This heart will, this heart will beat for you  
If you want it to  
If you want it to

Oh I love to give you love

Part time heart is what you need  
What you want now baby  
You won't get from me  
Full time love is on your mind  
I got a heart with your name on it, name on it  
I got love, I got love, I got love for you
