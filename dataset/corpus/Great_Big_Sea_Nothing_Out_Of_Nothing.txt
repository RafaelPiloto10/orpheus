Left my home and family by the ocean  
Out on my own, to seek my fortune  
But there is no work to occupy these young hands  
So look out boy you're heading for the mainland  
  
[Chorus]  
What do you do? You can't make nothing out of nothing  
Everybody needs a start  
What do you do? You can't make nothing our of nothing  
In my country back is heart.  
  
Well, I was born on a St.John's street  
Where all my hopes could meet with defeat  
I hide my fear in higher education  
Now I am so smart I could rule this content-nation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm alone but I'm working everyday  
I'm getting stoned and I'm blowing all my pay  
Just to survive I'll do whatever I can  
Now, I'm alive, but how can I be a real man?  
  
[Chorus]
