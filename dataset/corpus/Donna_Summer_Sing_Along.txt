I've an emptiness inside  
That can only be describe  
As a sad song  
With the paint all peeling off  
All the world I used to know  
It's a sad song  
He gave my life a meaning  
When all hope inside had die  
The he took the meaning back  
And left me feeling oh disillusioned  
He just walked out of my world  
Like you'd walk out of a room  
Oh you sad song  
  
Sing along with my song  
If you're lost and you're alone  
Sing along if your song  
Has theme of love gone wrong  
Sing along and belong  
Don't hold back we're growing strong  
Sing along sing your song  
Sing your sad your sad sad song  
  
Ain't it strange the way life goes  
First you're used and then disposed  
Like a sad song  
Saying love was just a word  
Used to keep you hanging there  
Like a sad song  
You swallowed all those promises  
So called upon you are  
And following his footsteps  
No matter just how far must follow  
He just walked out of a room  
Oh you sad song  
  
Sing along with my song  
If you're lost and you're alone  
Sing along if your song  
Has theme of love gone wrong  
Sing along and belong  
Don't hold back we're growing strong  
Sing along sing your song  
Sing your sad you sad sad song...
