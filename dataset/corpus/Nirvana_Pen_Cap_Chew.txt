Mmmmm, lies again  
Mmmmm, lies  
Mmmmm, mmmmm  
  
You go, you give, you get, you get to me  
All the years of tyrants such an easy way to go  
You go, you give, you get, you get to me  
Hide the struggle under the scaling of fingernails  
  
Mmmm, lies again  
Mmmmm, lies  
Mmmmm, mmmm  
  
You're lonely  
  
Waste your time by saving worthless gullibles  
Give up all additions in there where it's cold  
This decade is the age of rehashing  
Protest swine, go to jail, the travesty  
  
Two minutes slow  
Oh
