There's a light, certain kinda light,  
Never ever, never shone on me, no, no.  
Honey, I want, I want my whole life  
To be lived with you, babe,  
That's what I want oh, was to be  
Living and loving you.  
  
There's a way, oh everybody say  
You can do anything, every thing yeah.  
But what good, what good,  
Honey, what good could it ever bring  
Cause I ain't got you with my love  
And I can't find you babe, no I can't.  
  
You don't know, you don't know what it's like,  
No you don't, honey no you don't know,  
You don't know what it's like  
To love anybody.  
Oh honey, I want to talk about love  
And trying to hold somebody  
The way I love you babe,  
And I've been loving you babe.  
  
In my brain, oh I can see your face again,  
I know my frame of mind, yeah.  
But nobody, nobody has to ever be so blind,  
Honey, like I did, I know I was blind,

Oh but I'm just a girl,  
Can't you just take a look at me and tell,  
Tell that I live, honey I live and I breathe for you,  
Don't you know I do!  
  
But what good, what good,  
Honey, what good could ever do  
Cause I ain't got you, that's all I've ever wanted,  
And I ain't got you, babe, oh but I've been looking 'round.  
But you don't know, you don't know what it's like,  
No you don't, no, no, no, you don't know,  
Honey, you don't know what it's like  
Oh to love anybody.  
Oh honey I want to talk about  
Trying to hold somebody when you're lonely  
The way I loved you, baby,  
And I just want you to know I tried.  
  
Oh I know that there's a way  
Cause everybody came to me one time and said,  
"Honey, you can do anything,  
Every little thing," and I think I can.  
Oh, but what good, what good,  
Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring,  
Cause I can't find you with my love,  
And I can't find you babe, oh anywhere.  
  
Oh, but you don't know,
