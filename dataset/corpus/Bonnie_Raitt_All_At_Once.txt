Had a fight with my daughter  
She flew off in a rage  
Third time this week  
Don't tell me it's the age  
Don't know how I lost her  
I only know that it's a shame  
Ever since her daddy left  
The girl ain't been the same  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me  
Waiting there for me  
Ah, who am I kiddin'  
I should have known he'd never leave  
The time we spend together  
Is harder than the time between  
You wouldn't think it could hurt so  
To see 'em out the other day  
If that's what he calls leavin'  
I guess I threw it all away  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me  
Waiting just for me  
They say women, we're the stronger  
Somehow we always make it through  
Hell, that ain't what I feel right now  
I don't even think it's true  
To me there's lots more broken  
Than anyone can really see  
Why the angels turn their backs on some  
It's a mystery to me  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me
