Love don't need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that I can't stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are  
  
The seed is spilled, the bed defiled  
For you, a virgin bride  
Hide yourself in someone else  
Don't find yourself in me  
  
I can't lift you up again  
Love comes tumbling down again  
  
Love don't need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that you can stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are
