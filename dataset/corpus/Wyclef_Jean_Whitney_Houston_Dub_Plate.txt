Why'all want to thank why'all for coming out tonight to see me  
Right now put your hands together  
For original, original diva, original dub plate  
No one can play this but Refugee's on the number 1 tour  
Now listen to Miss Whitney Houston (come with it!)  
  
Yo, this is Whitney Houston  
Yes massive this is the original vocalist  
I'd like to say rest in peace to Dennis Brown  
  
If tomorrow is Judgment Day (light is in the air)  
And I'm standing on the front line (aiyyo!)  
Um, and the Lord asks me what I did with my life  
I would say: "Wyclef murdered a sound boy" (yo, huh!)  
If I wake up in World War III  
(If youo believe in the most high hands in the air!)  
I see the destruction in poverty  
(East coast, west coast, hey, hey!)  
And I feel like I want to go home (South side!)  
It's okay, as long as Wyclef is with me  
(North side, Jamaican, Caribbean, Haitian  
Hands in the air, everybody, hey!)  
My love is your dubbing, my dub is your dub  
It will take eternity to break us  
And the change of our start? (Listen to me!)  
As myself is yourself  
'Cause the refugee sound is the only sound  
It will take eternity to break us  
And a million sound boys will die before us  
  
This for the hardcore, before I had the record deal you kno what I'm sayin'?  
I'ma take why'all back when I was walking down the street  
My little girl saying: Yo Clef, that nigga trying to stick with something  
Walk over to him and said: Yo...
