How hard is it for me to wait for you  
See you in the next one have a good time  
Could be a lifetime before I see you again  
See you in the next one have a good time  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way  
It was hate the way it is now  
  
Lack of time and a wasted week end  
You wore your lies like a filmstar  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way it was  
Hate the way it is now
