Call me  
Any time just call me  
Tell me that you want me  
Feel it everywhere  
  
Hold me  
Never let go of me  
I love it when you hold me  
Tell me that you care  
  
And if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I could be with you  
If I could be with you  
  
Touch me  
You know you make it beautiful  
Everything is physical  
It really turns me on  
  
Miss me  
Every time you go away  
Don't you leave me lonely  
I hate it when you're gone  
  
And if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I would be with you  
If I could be with you  
  
Yeah and if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I could be with you  
Yes I could be with you  
Little darling  
  
I'm gonna wait for you  
I'm gonna wait for you  
Hmm love is coming  
Sure love is coming  
  
Want me  
Lovers say you want me  
And tell me that you need me  
Is all I wanna know  
  
I'll be  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
I love it when you haunt me  
Everywhere I go  
  
I come running  
If I could be  
I come running  
If I could be  
  
I come running  
I come running  
I come running  
I come running  
  
I come running back to you  
I come running back to you  
  
Call me  
Never let go of me
