If I seem a bit crazy  
It's because these thoughts they crowd my mind  
Gets a little bit hazy  
These events distort my sense of time  
My heart's like a cave where the sun  
The sun refuse to shine  
  
Well, it's bleeding me dry  
It's a little like an ancient remedy  
Nowhere left to hide  
Leeching all my energy  
My thoughts turn to death  
When I'm in your company  
  
It used to be that our planets  
Were so perfectly aligned in our time  
If you could see that, now it's harder to bring back  
All your dreams and all you've left way behind  
  
there's been a subtle shift  
In the population's hearts and minds  
Is there something I missed'  
Something kinda hard to define  
Now we search for evidence  
Of the stranger in our midst  
  
It used to be that our planets  
Were so perfectly aligned in our time
