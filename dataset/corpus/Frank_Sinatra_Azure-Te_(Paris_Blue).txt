Gone and got the blues in Paris,  
Paris blues called Azure-Te,  
How can I be blue in Paris?  
Easy 'cause you're far away.  
Can't lose these blues, this Azure-Te.  
Side-walk tables filled with people,  
Always happy, always gay,  
Still I'm all alone in Paris,  
Praying you'll return someday,  
Can't lose this blues, this Azure-Te  
  
Montmarte, springtime, Eiffel Tower,  
Funny taxis, the kids at play,  
Paris without you is lonesome,  
Yearning more and more each day,  
Can't lose these blues, this Azure-Te,  
If you knew how much I need you,  
You'd come back to me to stay,  
Having you with me in Paris,  
Really is the only way,  
You'd lose these blues, this Azure-Te  
These Paris blues, this Azure-Te.
