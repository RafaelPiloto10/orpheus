Another morning, such as ordinary day  
She's doin' time from nine to five  
The hours waste away  
There's no escape, She's a part of the bog machine  
She's a slave to the suit and tie  
Seven days a week  
  
But every night  
She can hardly wait  
It feels alright  
To give it all away  
  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(She needs it bad, real real bad)  
She wants what she never had  
All the things that make a good girl bad  
She gets her kicks after six  
  
Some days its hard to face the cruel reality  
Just waitin' for the bell to ring  
She wants to be free  
It feels so good to start another endless night  
She spreads her wings for another flight  
She's running wild  
  
But every night  
She can hardly wait  
It feels alright  
To give it all away  
  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(She needs it bad, real real bad)  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(Ooh yeah shake it for me baby)  
She wants what she never had  
All the things that make a good girl bad  
She gets her kicks after six  
  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(She needs it bad, real real bad)  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(Ooh yeah nothin's gonna stop her)  
She wants what she never had  
All the things that make a good girl bad  
She gets her kicks after six  
  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(She needs it bad, real real bad)  
Good girls get their kicks after six  
(C'mon baby take it to the limit)  
She wants what she never had  
All the things that make a good girl bad  
She gets her kicks after six
