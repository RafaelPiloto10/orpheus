How can you live in such a state?  
Your mind is empty and you're full of hate  
The things you say and the things you do  
Mark you down as a helpless fool  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
It's gonna be all right through the night  
Tomorrow comes and you're full of shame  
Oh baby! You play the crying game  
Aaaah...  
Gonna be a long time baby  
Before we get it sorted out all right  
I'll drag you out to Utopia, baby  
[? We'll end up heading?] south  
I need, I need, I need to know  
If you gonna do me right  
If you do the things I ask of you  
I'll tell the world tonight  
He he he he hee... All right  
You do me right, you do me wrong  
Tell me, where do I belong?  
You do me up, you do me down  
I accept it all without a frown  
You love like a woman in a fantasy  
Ha ha ha I admire you for my dream  
You dream of life and you dream of [???]  
High enough but I'm back again  
I love, I love, I love the funny ways  
Oh you throw me in a daze  
If you ever left me woman  
I'd destroy myself, sure as hell  
Aaaah...  
We're gonna ride a slow train baby  
And take all the whistles stops oh no - yes we are  
We'll put down the blinds while the carriage flies  
[? The engine burns hot?] while the fuzz is going on  
So I'll burn its [???] to ash  
Well there's a life to live and there's love to give  
Ready! Steady! Smash!  
Alright! Yeah! Uh mmh!  
You just got to be out of your head  
Whe you say you'll go look for the bottom of the top  
Well I'll be waiting and won't give it a rest  
[?????????????????????????????]  
[??????????????] something's going on  
And it's sure [???????]  
Just like me he
