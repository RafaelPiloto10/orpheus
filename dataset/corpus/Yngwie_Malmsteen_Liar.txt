You came to me  
You said you were my friend  
I shared my art and my mind.  
You found it easier  
To steal than create.  
Then call it your's, though it's mine  
  
You can't fight, what is right  
Face the truth, liar  
You can't feel, you just steal  
Face the truth, liar  
  
You smile in my face,  
When I turn around,  
You stick a knife in my back.  
You think you're clever,  
You know you're insane,  
You're lies are not white they are black.  
  
You can't fight, what is right  
Face the truth, liar  
You can't feel, you just steal  
Face the truth, liar
