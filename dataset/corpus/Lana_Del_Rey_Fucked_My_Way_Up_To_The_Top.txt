[Verse 1]  
Life is awesome, I confess,  
What I do, I do best.  
You got nothing, I got tested,  
And I passed, yes.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lay me down tonight,  
In my linen and curls.  
Lay me down tonight,  
Riviera girls.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
Go baby, go.  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show.  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a dragon,  
You're a whore,  
Don't even know what you're good for.  
Mimicking me is a fucking bore,  
To me.  
But babe.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lay me down tonight,  
In my diamonds and pearls.  
Tell me songs at night,  
About your favourite girl.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
Go baby, go  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
  
[Bridge]  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,  
Need you baby, more, more, more, more  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,  
Fuckin' need you baby, more, more, more, more.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lay me down tonight,  
In my linen and curls,  
Lay me down tonight,  
I'm your favourite girl.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
Go baby, go  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
  
[Outro]  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,  
Need you baby, more, more, more, more  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,  
Aaahh.
