The man steps out in the moonlight  
At the sound of a scream from below.  
He thinks he is a warrior  
So he picks up his sword and goes.  
  
From the mouth of the monster  
He rescues the maiden fair.  
But we know shes a demon  
Come to lure him to demons lair.  
  
Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads  
To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home.  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.  
  
And though his body bids him  
To enter in with her,  
There was something in her manner  
That his mind could not ignore.  
  
Also it is whispered  
In the kingdom far and wide,  
To beware a little cottage  
In the forest in a glade.  
  
For who knows what magic takes place in his world?  
So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way.  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.  
  
Come to my garden,  
Taste the fruits and the spices of love.  
You cant resist me,  
I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of.  
  
So glad you could make it  
We had everything arranged.  
So glad you saw fit to pay a call.  
  
Some men never listen,  
And others never learn,  
But why this man did as he did  
Only he will ever know.  
  
He knew he was walking  
Into a waiting trap,  
Neatly set up for him  
With a bait so richly wrapped.  
  
So he went inside there to take on what he found  
But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires?  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
I'll give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.
