Saturday night and you're still hangin' around  
Tired of living in your one horse town  
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground  
For a while  
  
So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans  
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens  
It's like some pornographic magazine  
And you smile  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Your sister's gone out, she's on a date  
You just sit at home and masturbate  
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait  
For that call  
  
So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes  
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes  
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose  
After all,...  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you decide to take a holiday  
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet  
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway  
What for?  
  
So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool  
They just found your father in the swimming pool  
And you guess you won't be going back to school  
Anymore.  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot  
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot  
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got  
What went wrong?  
  
And if you can't understand why your world is so dead,  
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head  
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed,  
And that's too long  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'
