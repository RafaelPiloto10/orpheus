The weather channel girl with her perfect weather curl  
Is talking "Cold, cold, cold"  
You can't get out of bed  
You can't remember what you've said  
You're feeling old, old, old  
  
Is it a fever or depression, anger or aggression  
What's the remedy?  
We're not talking rocket science  
The answer to your question's  
Very plain to see  
  
You need a holiday, take a holiday  
Find a far-off wonderland  
Where you might regain command of your life today  
Take a holiday, you need a holiday  
Grab a pack and hit the trail  
Take a sail and wind up in some moonlit bay  
  
You're caught in the Internet  
You think it's such a great asset  
You're wrong , wrong, wrong  
All that fiber optic gear  
Still cannot take away the fear  
Like and island song  
  
Disregard confession, stop trying to make impressions  
On your corporate climb  
It might come as quite a shock  
But you can't really own that rock  
It's just a waste of time.  
  
So, take a holiday, take a holiday  
Find a place to find yourself  
Take your life sown off that shelf  
Quit acting so blase  
Take a holiday, you need a holiday  
grab a pack and hit the trail  
Take a sail and wind on some moonlit bay  
  
Well, it's only up to you, no one else can teach you to  
Go out and have some fun  
Though, if you want to stay alive  
Evade the big nose dive  
Be a comedian  
  
And take a holiday, you need a holiday  
Find a far-off wonderland  
Where you might regain command of your life today  
Take a holiday, you need a holiday  
Grab a pack and hit the trail  
Take a sail and wind up in some moonlit bay  
  
You need a holiday, take a holiday  
Find a place to find yourself  
Take your life down off that shelf  
Quit acting so blase  
Take a holiday, you need a holiday  
Grab a pack and hit the trail  
Take a sail and wind up in some moonlit bay
