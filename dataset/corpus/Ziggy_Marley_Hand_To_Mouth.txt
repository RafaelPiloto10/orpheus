Free zone workers you working hard everyday  
But all the work you do don't get enough pay  
I mad I still don't know why I still don't know why  
Is minimum wage for your sufferation have no more toleration  
  
Hand to mouth can't work

Hand to mouth business no it can't work  
School teachers you working hard educating  
But all the work you do they take you for a play thing  
I mad I still don't know why I still don't know why  
Is little bit a pay for your contribution and you mean so much to the nation  
Me say me naah get enough good weh day  
All thema work is like them naah get no pay  
Naah get enough food from weh day  
All the work we work is like we naah get no pay  
Watching everything go up in inflation  
Food price go up and man pay a go down  
Ask some a them

But in a corner we wings and a jam  
Ragga ragga a watch the notion  
Say we naah get no good food from weh day  
Naah sow no good seed from weh day  
Naah sow no good seed from weh day

Our nurses saving lives everyday  
But all the lives you save you don't get enough pay

Is little bit a pay for your life savings  
What a grave they're digging

But all the food they grow import them a say

Your sister got to shop for two  
Oh civil servants you working hard everyday and  
You sweating out for your pay

Don't treat them right is total confusion

Same way engineer a bawl how him pay too small  
Can't build him house with no concrete wall  
Bass man a cry bout him can't get string  
Have the contacts and can't bring them in raggamuffin dj and sing  
  
Lord naah get enough good from weh day  
All the talk we talk is like we naah Lord  
Naah get no good yood from weh day  
All the bawl we bawl say them no hear wha we a say  
Watching everything go up in inflation  
Food price go up and man pay a god down  
Some a them

Ziggy zaggy a watch the movements
