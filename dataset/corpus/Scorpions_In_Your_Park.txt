In the night there is  
A gentle voice of silence  
So low and quiet  
She'll catch me 'cause I've been longing.  
  
I want to walk in your park  
'cause I'm alone,  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you? I don't know  
  
I look around and see  
The sunshine in the morning.  
(Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley)  
  
On my journey I change the time,  
Leave everything behind me.  
(Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley)  
  
I want to walk in your park  
'cause I'm alone,  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you? I don't know  
  
Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!
