I'll take care of you  
Times are hard and rents are high  
What can the working girl do?  
But struggle through another day  
Then I'll take care of you.  
Nights are long and dreams are cold  
If they're all you wake up to  
But sure you rise with crying eyes  
I'll take care of you.  
So let 'em talk about us  
Let 'em call us funny things  
People sometimes do  
I don't care as long  
As you know I love you  
You know I do.  
I'll be there but you might not see me  
It's not easy to get through  
But when the laughter dies, I'll wake  
I'll take care of you  
Darling, I'll take care of you.
