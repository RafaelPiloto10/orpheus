Some people call me the space cowboy yeah  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me Maurice  
Cause' I speak of the promises of love  
  
People talk about me baby  
Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong  
But don't you worry baby don't worry  
Cause' I'm right here at home  
  
Cause' I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
Playin' my music in the sun  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a mid-night toker  
I get my lovin' on the run  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see  
I really love your peaches  
Want to shake your tree  
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time  
Ooh wee baby, I sure show you a good time  
  
Cause' I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
Playin' my music in the sun  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a mid-night toker  
I sure don't want to hurt no one  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
People keep talkin' about me baby  
Say I'm doin' you wrong  
Well don't you worry, don't worry, no don't worry mama  
Cause' I'm right here at home  
You're the cutest thing I ever did see  
Really love your peaches want to shake your tree  
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time  
Come on baby now, I'll show you a good time
