Charles trenet (jack lawrence)  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sands  
And watches the ships that go sailing  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
He's watching for me  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straigt to his arms I'd go sailing  
It's far beyond a star, it's near beyond the moon  
I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And never again i'll go sailing  
Some sailing
