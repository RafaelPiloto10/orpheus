I feel so numb  
Staring at the shower wall  
It's begun,  
The feeling that the end has come  
And now the water's cold  
  
I tried to eat today  
But the lump in my throat got in the way  
  
In this time I've lost all sense of pride  
I've called a hundred times  
If I hear your voice I'll be fine  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep  
These four walls and me  
  
I lay in bed  
Can't seem to leave your side  
Your pillow's wet  
From all these tears I've cried  
I won't say goodbye  
  
I tried to smile today  
Then I realized there's no point anyway  
  
In this time I've lost all sense of pride  
I've called a thousand times  
If I hear your voice I'll be fine  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep  
These four walls and me  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep  
These four walls and me
