I don't want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
I gotta wait 'til the sun is down  
I'm getting ready for another flight  
Only if you're ready  
And you're willing to drown  
You can be mine tonight  
I'm never ever gonna live reality  
In the daylight  
I'd never survive  
I could never be your angel  
Even if I tried  
  
I don't want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
  
I don't want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
  
I don't want to be your angel  
I want to be your witch  
I gotta wait 'til the sun is down  
I'm getting ready for another flight  
Only if you're ready  
And you're willing to drown  
You can be mine tonight  
I'm never ever gonna live reality  
In the daylight  
I'd never survive  
I could never be your angel  
Even if I tried
