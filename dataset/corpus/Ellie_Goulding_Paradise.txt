[Verse 1]  
I've been filling in the blanks  
You left me with your open hands  
I never knew what I had to do  
Stumbling out in the dark  
You left me with a question mark  
You said the bridges had to be burned  
  
[Refrain]  
And it's a pain that only we know  
Oh and you lost all on your own  
Always has to be a new scare  
To keep us falling over the edge  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise  
Paradise, paradise, paradise  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's a place we try to reach  
Impossible as it would seem  
I heard you crying out in your sleep  
I see that look you save for me  
I pull you back upon your feet  
I know you always need something more, more  
  
[Refrain]  
And it's a thing that only we know  
Oh and you lost all on your own  
Always has to be a new scare  
To keep us falling over the edge  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
  
[Bridge]  
I know we're headed for a moment, baby  
We made sense of it  
I know I struck you so reckless, honey  
We gave into it  
I know we're headed for a moment, baby  
We made sense of it  
I know I struck you so reckless, honey  
We gave in  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
