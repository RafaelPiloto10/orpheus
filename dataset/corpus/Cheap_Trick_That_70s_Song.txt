Hangin' out  
Down the street  
The same old thing  
We did last week  
  
Not a thing to do  
But talk to you  
Wow, yea!  
  
Mom and dad  
Live upstairs  
The music's loud  
So we don't care  
  
Nick's still young  
But rock lives on  
Oh yea  
  
We're still rockin'  
In Wisconsin  
We're all alright  
We're all alright  
Yea!  
Oh  
  
I Still recall  
And drive on down  
Pick you up  
And we'll drive around  
  
Not a thing to do  
But talk to you  
Not a thing to do  
Oh yea!  
  
We're still rockin'  
In Wisconsin  
We're all alright  
We're all alright  
Yea!  
(Oh yea, oh yea)  
  
(hello Wisconsin!)
