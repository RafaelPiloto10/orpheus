It's gonna--be--me  
Oh, yeah  
  
You might been hurt, babe  
That ain't no lie  
You've seen them all come and go, oh  
I remember you told me  
That it made you believe in  
No man, no cry  
Maybe that's why  
  
[Chorus]  
Every little thing I do  
Never seems enough for you  
You don't want to lose it again  
But I'm not like them  
Baby, when you finally  
Get to love somebody  
Guess what  
It's gonna be me  
  
You've got no choice, babe  
But to move on, and you know  
There ain't no time to waste  
So just you're just too blind, to see  
But in the end, ya know it's gonna be me  
You can't deny  
So just tell me why  
  
Every little thing I do  
Never seems enough for you  
You don't want to lose it again  
But I'm not like them  
Baby, when you finally  
Get to love somebody (somebody)  
Guess what (guess what)  
It's gonna be me  
  
It's gonna be me  
Oh yeah  
  
There comes a day  
When I'll be the one, you'll see  
  
It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna  
Justin: It's gonna be me  
All that I do is not enough for you  
Don't want to lose it  
But I'm not like that  
When finally (finally)  
You get to love  
Guess what? (guess what?)  
It's gonna be me  
  
Every little thing I do  
Never seems enough for you (for you babe)  
You don't want to lose it again (don't want to lose it)  
But I'm not like them  
Baby, when you finally  
Get to love somebody (love)  
Guess what (guess what)  
It's gonna be me  
  
Every little thing I do  
Never seems enough for you  
You don't want to lose it again (don't want to lose it)  
But I'm not like them  
Baby, when you finally (baby when you finally)  
Get to love somebody  
Guess what (guess what)  
  
It's gonna be me
