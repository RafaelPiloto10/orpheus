Here we are in a warm embrace  
As cozy as a kitten by a fireplace  
The lights are dim with a mellow glow  
The musics playin' soft 'n low.  
  
And everything's rosy, oh yea  
Comfy 'n cozy, uh huh  
Everything's rosy, yea, yea  
Comfy 'n cozy, hmm, hmm, hmm  
  
Let's forget the whole world outside  
Nothing else matters just you and I  
Let's unhook the old telephone  
'Cause we just want to be left alone.  
  
With everything's rosy, yea, yea, yea  
Comfy 'n cozy, uh huh, huh  
Everything's rosy, yea, yea, yea  
Comfy 'n cozy, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm  
  
Wanna put another log on the fireplace  
But I can't stand leavin' your embrace, hmm, hmm, hmm hmm  
  
Baby now, everything's rosy, oh yeah  
Comfy 'n cozy, uh huh  
Everything's rosy, oh yeah  
Comfy 'n cozy, uh huh  
Everything's rosy, yea, yea  
Comfy 'n cozy
