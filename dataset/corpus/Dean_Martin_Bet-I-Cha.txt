Deep in the dark jungles of Africa  
There is a goddess the natives call Bet-I-Cha  
Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha  
(Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha)  
It's a story that's told of a maid that never will fade  
The tale of Bet-I-Cha  
(Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha)  
Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha  
She's the song of delight in the night the natives will sing to you  
Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha  
The wise men say she's a spirit  
Whose lover left long ago  
But others say she's the music  
Of lover's hearts all aglow  
She may be moonlight so bright  
Or soft winds sighin' at night  
No matter where you may find her  
She's one part close to your heart  
Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha  
(Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha)  
It's a story that's told of a maid that never will fade  
The tale of Bet-I-Cha  
They sing of Bet-I-Cha  
They sing of Bet-I-Cha  
They sing of Bet-I-Cha  
They sing of Bet-I-Cha
