There's a family Bible on the table  
Each page is torn and hard to read  
But the family Bible on the table  
Will ever be my key to memories  
At the end of day when work was over  
And when the evening meal was done  
Dad would read to us from the family Bible  
And we'd count our many blessings one by one  
I can see us sittin' round the table  
When from the family Bible dad would read  
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages cleft for me  
  
Now this old world of ours is full of trouble  
This old world would also better be  
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables  
And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me  
I can see us sittin' round the table  
When from the family Bible dad would read  
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages  
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
