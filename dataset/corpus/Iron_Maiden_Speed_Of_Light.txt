Another time another place  
A hollow universe in space  
I took a trip to see the sights  
That will be blacker than the night  
  
One way ticket no returns  
My shooting stars are vastly burnt  
On the edge that you can see  
  
Let's shoot the moon you and me  
I'm not particular you'll see  
Just a lonesome galaxy  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
We slip into the night  
  
I'll say a mass for you and wave  
Shooting plasma from my grave  
  
Event horizon lost in space  
Running in a human race  
  
I don't know where I don't know why  
But somehow back in time again  
I'm on the edge that you can see  
  
I'm not particular at night  
A single party calling me  
You won't be tracking me by sight  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
We're slipping through the night  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
We're slipping through the night
