They think that I've got the bread  
They want to read my head  
The position show his cool  
Like football star in school  
  
Someone to sell me  
Someone to tell me  
I'm a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
I'm a dead rock star  
  
I'm so afraid of failing  
I hang onto the railing  
This cold hard graduation  
Kills all infatuation  
I took the hazing  
They said "amazing"  
I'm a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
I'm a dead rock star  
  
I gathered awful knowledge  
You cannot get in college  
Would you like Cain or Abel  
I'll bring them to the table  
  
They try to rope me  
They try to grope me  
I'm a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
I'm a dead rock star  
What can I hope for?  
What can I hope for?  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to live for  
I'm a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
I'm a dead rock star
