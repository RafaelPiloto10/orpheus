Here she come, right on time  
Tenement mixer, givin' the hard line  
Hammerin' down walls of steel  
Permanent fixer, it's a bad sign  
She's runnin' right over you  
Ain't no way to control her...steamroller  
  
Can't figure you out, she's big trouble  
Soul-contractor, makin' your pain pay double  
Don't want to know, 'bout no last chance  
Outa time, now you're last year's model  
She's crawlin' all over you  
Still you try to console her......steamroller  
  
She's rollin' all over you  
Try survivin' below her  
She's rollin' all over you  
Like a head-kickin', ass-whippin'  
Steamin'-demon fast bowler......steamroller  
  
Here she come, there you go  
Boa-constrictor, takin' it real slow  
Price of fame, down to zero  
She's a run-away train, puttin' on a real show  
She's comin' back over you  
Like a Bay City roller......steamroller  
  
Steamroller...steamroller...steamroller
