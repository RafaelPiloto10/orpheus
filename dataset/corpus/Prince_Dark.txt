I want to top the rose petals that whisper sweet  
Come on  
So dark, dark, so dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
  
Inside lookin' out my window  
I don't see nothin' but rain  
Sun up in the sky just a shinin' (just a shinin')  
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain  
  
Like an innocent man that's on death row  
I don't understand what made you go  
And want to leave me baby  
Leave me in the dark  
  
Can you tell me, tell me?  
  
You took my sex and my money (money)  
Took all my self esteem, yes you did  
You had the nerve to think it was funny (funny)  
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir  
  
You absolutely drove a man to tears  
All I really know is that you sincerely  
You want to hurt me baby, oh yes you do  
You want to hurt me in the dark  
  
(Sunshine) Somebody make the sun shine  
(Dark cloud) Somebody take this dark cloud away  
  
Just as sure as Noah built the ark  
That's how sure  
That's how sure I am you broke my heart  
  
How could you baby, leave me in the dark?  
Baby, so dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
Feel like the sun ain't never gonna shine  
You left me in the dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had to part  
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)  
(So dark, dark, so dark)  
  
Sometimes I want to curse the ground you walk on  
Even when I know that everything you feel I feel it to  
I want to curse you baby  
You left me in the dark  
And now I want to, I want to curse you baby  
For leavin' me alone, alone, alone  
You left me in the dark, yes you did  
  
And now all I want to say is  
In the dark  
Ow, you left me  
Ow, you left me  
It's like being on death row (In the dark)  
I don't understand why you had to go  
I don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)  
Don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)  
Don't understand why you hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)  
Hurt me (hurt me in, hurt me in)  
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me (hurt me in the dark)  
Just leave me  
In the dark  
  
In the dark  
So dark, dark, so dark (In the dark)  
So dark, dark, so dark  
In the dark
