Everyday the population is growing  
And to find some peace of mind is something rare  
Don't you get discouraged, keep on going  
And don't you mind the way that the people turn and stare  
Now how long can you keep on feeling guilty  
And tell me why should you feel bad about feeling good  
Don't you know that the world is cold and filthy,  
Aw yes it is, but if you're a special child  
  
They know sometimes you'll be misunderstood, (you can never look back)  
Yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is here today  
Keep on fighting, a quitter never wins,  
Hold your breath stick out your chin  
Count to ten, start again,  
  
Everybody wants to be somebody  
But they can't seem to see the forest for the trees,  
We just can't let our past hold back our future, oh, no, no,  
When its all over but the shouting  
Nothing is left but memories,  
Looks like you could use a little bit of happiness  
Now I know that its really hard to find,  
But you owe it to yourself to have the very best  
  
And only a fool will try to catch up to what he has left behind, (you can
never look back)  
No, no, 'cause yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is here today  
  
And when you're crying, you need someone to hold on to  
It's not the end of the world my friend, tip your hat, start again  
And keep a positive direction, oh,  
Keep your vision straight ahead  
  
You can't lose with the stuff you use,  
We've come too far just to turn around, oh, oh,  
Don't you look back, yesterday is dead and gone (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is on the way and if you're fighting people, a quitter never
wins  
  
Hold your breath, stick out your chin,  
Count to ten, start again, don't you look back  
No, no, uh, oh, (don't look back)  
No 'cause we've come much too far  
Just to turn around, uh, oh, oh, (repeat don't you look back)  
Don't you look back now  
Yesterday is dead and gone, don't you look back,  
Your tomorrow is here today  
  
And when you're crying, 'cause all your friends have forsaken you  
Its not the end of the world my friend,  
Just tip your hat start again  
Keep on steppin' y'all, don't look back,  
Don't turn your head around  
Get up, get out on the good foot,  
Keep on fightin,' yeah, hold your breath  
Stick out your chin, count to ten and start again, don't try it  
You got to keep on movin' y'all,  
Get, get, get up on the good foot
