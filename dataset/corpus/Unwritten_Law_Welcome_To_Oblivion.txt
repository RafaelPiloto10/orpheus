You're the chemical I'm in trouble I've lost all control  
C'mon 12 o'clock in the savon parking lot a 30 day supply  
To get us high or say goodbye tonight my love  
Welcome to oblivion here I come Here I come  
Burning bridges just for fun one by one damage done  
Can you feel me here I come and my darling remedy oh please please please
don't leave me  
2 o'clock now we've been around the block  
We've closed the bar and lost the car we've come too far to stop tonight my
love  
  
Welcome to oblivion here I come here I come  
Burning bridges just for fun one by one damage done  
Can you feel me here I come yes it tastes like  
You might might be laced but I'm not sure cause I can't feel you anymore  
Welcome to oblivion destruction here I come  
Burning bridges just for fun yeah the damage has been done  
I'm torn to pieces small enough to pick me up so pick me up
