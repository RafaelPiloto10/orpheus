One eye on the shadows, protecting his fellows  
From sun up to the moon on his back  
Sent the villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies  
A stallion in the sack  
  
You can't get your life back  
When right follows left Jack  
The more you see the less you know  
When others would leak it, his service is secret  
Plays God when it's your time to go  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
From the House of Lords, saving Norfolk broads  
Commoners and landed gentry  
His word his bond, whether brunette or blonde  
Baby, it's so elementary  
  
For the man never messed up your life with one stare  
See the film, you'll know how it goes  
But this ain't no fiction  
Just check the diction quid pro quo, a pro's pro  
  
Hey fellas, don't be jealous  
When they made him they broke the mold  
So charismatic, with an automatic  
Never prematurely shooting his load  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe
