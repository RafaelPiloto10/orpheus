Lift Your Voices Up  
Raise The Roof Now  
We Are Coming  
There's No Stopping Us  
Here we go!  
  
Let The Creatures of pray  
Raise a clamor round your ears  
Cursing, screaming voices full of fear  
Of fear!  
  
It's a tale of the fool  
Designed to weaken you  
Full of sound and fury  
And jealous lies  
It tries-but I'm free!  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
[Chorus]  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
You and I  
  
Marching on to victory  
Your path is paved with scars  
A victim of illusion  
You shoot far- so far  
Oh, but your reach  
Should always exceed your your grasp  
Or what's a heaven for  
But to last- to last  
Die free!  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
[Chorus]
