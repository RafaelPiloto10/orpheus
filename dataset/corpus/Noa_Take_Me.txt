Take me, take me as I am  
Take me, don't let go my hand  
Take the part of me that strives to reach the light  
Take my hand and lead me through the darkest night  
  
Hold me, when I'm feeling low  
Hold me, never let me go  
Hold the part of me that fears the setting sun  
Hold my hand and tell of better days to come  
  
Everyone I know plays games  
Everybody's so untrue  
When it's over what remains  
Nobody but me and you  
  
Hold me, when I fall apart  
Hold me, closer to your heart  
Hold the part of me that vibrates when I sing  
Hold me so I'm not afraid of anything  
  
Everyone I know plays games  
Everybody's so untrue  
When it's over what remains  
Nobody but me and you  
  
So take me, take me as I am  
Take me, don't let go my hand  
Take the part of me that strives to reach the light  
Take my hand and lead me through the darkest night  
  
Take me as I am  
Never let me go  
Take me as I am
