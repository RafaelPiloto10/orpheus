You've been cryin'  
Your face is a mess  
Come in baby  
You can dry the tears on my dress  
She's hurt you again  
I can tell  
Oh, I know that look so well  
  
Don't be shy  
You've been here before  
Pull your shoes off, lie down  
And I will lock the door  
  
And no-one has to know  
You've come here again  
Darling it will be  
Like it's always been before  
Come on over here  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said  
Ain't no need  
  
What's your hurry?  
Please don't eat and run  
You can let her wait, my darling  
It's been so long  
Since I've had you here  
You will come again  
Darling it will be  
Like it's always been before  
Hey child  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said, yeah  
You don't have to
