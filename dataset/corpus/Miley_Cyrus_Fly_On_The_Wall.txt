You don't understand what it is  
That makes me tick  
But you wish you did  
You always second guess, wonderin  
I say yes but you just lose out every time  
  
If you only knew what I talked about  
When I'm with my friends just hangin out  
Then you'd have the inside scoop  
On what to say, what to do  
That way when you play the game  
Baby you can never lose  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
You'd love to know, the things I do  
When I'm with my friends, and not with you  
You always second guess, wonderin  
There's other guys I'm flirting with  
You should know by now  
  
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you  
If I make a promise, I'm comin thru  
Don't you wish that you could  
See me every second of the day  
That way you would have no doubt  
But baby, i would never stray  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
A little communication  
That'll go all the way  
You're getting misinformation  
Too much hearsay, hearsay  
  
And what I say is  
Come a little closer  
And what I'm gonna say is  
  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't you wish you were a?  
Hey!  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
