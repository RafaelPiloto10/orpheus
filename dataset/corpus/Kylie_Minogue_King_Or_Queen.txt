You stand around the edge  
Lookin' tip-top, but you forget  
That when I look at you  
Baby I see so much more you could do  
Oh, come to me  
You'd look good in company  
And your wish is my command  
All you got to do is take my hand  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Don't you understand  
  
That body was made for dancin'  
So follow me down this way  
Come on, now twist it  
Turn it, turn it  
Push it, burn it, burn it  
Made for dancin'  
Totally designed to shake  
So come on, now twist it  
Turn it, turn it  
Push it, burn it, burn it  
  
Dress up, look the part  
Tie your name up on my heart  
Don't be so shy about it  
Don't get uptight about it  
Move close, can't you see  
You know you're gonna feel good next to me  
Cause oh, oh, don't you know
