Yo! here comes the intro  
It's time to let it go  
I live the life of my rhyme, I think I'll let it show  
So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm  
Then I know I've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'  
  
So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip  
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss  
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor  
I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for  
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large  
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage  
'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this  
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist  
So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit  
Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it  
  
[Chorus]  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
  
Go white boy, go white boy, go!  
Check out the hook. vanilla ice, yep, yep  
  
I'm makin' a killin' and chillin' because I'm cool as an ice  
Pack  
You're lovin' everything when I think of a new track  
I keep my rhyme flowin', notice it's right on time  
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line  
So put your body in motion and let me know that you're there  
And those playin' the wall don't be scared  
'cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat  
Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat  
I'm in rock mode now' cause I'm steppin' like a soldier  
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure  
Never the less I'm back to attack  
I came to manifest, and express to this dope track  
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice  
That's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!  
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top  
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop  
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction  
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'  
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked  
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell  
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females  
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt  
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault  
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to  
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you  
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook  
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea  
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end  
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop  
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper  
Flip this thing and sting like a viper  
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent  
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it  
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe  
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal  
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal  
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about  
Money, yea, is the key to all problems  
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em  
'cause I got the key, the key to attack  
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track  
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit  
Thinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it  
  
[Chorus]
