I was raised on nothing, so I save my money  
Emotional poverty, well I'm used to running  
  
How amazing you make me feel  
If I am crazy, don't want to know what's real  
  
You're like a wave of heaven and you're breaking on me  
To change the destiny of a girl that's lonely  
  
But how amazing and how surreal  
To live with a desire that you may never feel  
  
I can sell everything but my soul  
I have never settled just to play some kind of role  
  
I have give everything baby but my hand  
Mercy can you save me from this wonderful man  
  
I feel like a can  
I kick myself down the street  
  
I'm crushed for a while  
Then I get on my feet  
  
I loved the illusive in every man I saw  
I draw them to me like they were the last straw  
  
I can sell everything baby but my soul  
I have never settled just to play some kind of role  
I have given everything baby but my hand  
Mercy can you save me from this wonderful man
