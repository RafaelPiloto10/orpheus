Chorus 2x  
I smoke kush and I pop bean  
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me  
I sip lean pure codeine  
And I don't give a damn what you say about me  
  
I'm so iced up feel me up  
I'm so kushed up dog I'm stuck  
Sumbody help me I can't get up  
I bought a whole pound  
And I smoked da shit up  
No more purp lets restore  
Call da cush man tell him bring much more  
We ask anotha 2 litter  
We gon do four  
I'm so drowzy I might snore  
Chain so bright that you got a eye sore  
If yu aint wanna fuck what yu spend the night for  
Pulled all da ho's  
Dats what I got da ice for  
To win all da money  
Is what I shot da dice for  
Leaned to myself  
Damn I'm high

I'm lookin for some fire  
I'm dui we so drunk  
Yo girl manned up  
Wen she seen my trunk  
Pussy nigga it's gucci  
  
Chorus 2x  
I smoke kush and I pop bean  
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me  
I sip lean pure codeine  
And I don't give a damn what you say about me  
  
While yall sell ounces

Pussy ass fuck nigga  
Get tha fuck from round

Neva back down east a-town  
Boulder crest my stompin ground

So iced out check my new piece  
Heart shaped diamonds baby heart aint sweet  
Gucci frames on so I can't see

In my all white dump

Drag racin for tires  
  
Chorus 2x  
I smoke kush and I pop bean  
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me  
I sip lean pure codeine  
And I don't give a damn what you say about me
