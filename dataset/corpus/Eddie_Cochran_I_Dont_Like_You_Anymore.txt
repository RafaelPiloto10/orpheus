Yeah you told me you'd meet me at a movie show  
I waited and I waited but I had to go  
You're not the only girl in town  
I won't stand for your foolin' around  
Oh-no, ah-ah, I don't like you no more  
Well we went to a party last Saturday night  
Thought that everything would be all right  
But you had to go and put me down  
I just won't stand for your foolin' around  
Oh-no, ah-ah, I don't dig you no more  
Remember baby, when we first met  
You said you'd be my by in' pet  
Then you turned around just like that  
You're treatin' Eddie like a worn-out hat  
You're a two-time lover and a full-time flirt  
You ain't nothin' but a schemer in a very tight skirt  
But I'm gonna go and do the town  
I won't stand for your foolin' around  
Oh-no, ah-ah, I don't dig you no more
