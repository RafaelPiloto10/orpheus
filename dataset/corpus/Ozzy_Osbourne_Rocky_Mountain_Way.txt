Spent the last year  
Rocky mountain way  
Couldn't get much higher  
Out to pasture  
I think it's safe to say  
Time to open fire  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, oh yeah  
'cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way, oh  
  
Well he's tellin' us this,  
He's tellin' us that,  
Changin' it everyday  
Say's it doesn't matter  
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat  
Playin' it play by play  
It's time to change the batter  
  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad  
'Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way  
  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad  
'Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
It's better than the way we had  
It's better than the way we had  
So much better  
So much better  
It's so much better  
It's so much better  
  
Rocky mountain way
