I see a million torn up moments  
Of the rarest happiness  
Each one a dancing snowflake  
A piece of memory  
  
It's the ghost of days gone by  
Lay them tight across this old town  
In the silence of your smiling face  
You move to me  
  
And you are still beautiful  
You are still beautiful  
In this cold white night  
Still shining bright  
Still beautiful  
  
Regrets the cold wind that I know  
And it will not let me be  
And hopes your smiling face  
Can still can set me free  
  
And you are still beautiful  
You are still beautiful  
In this cold white night  
Still shining bright  
Still beautiful
