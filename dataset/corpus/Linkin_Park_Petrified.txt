No-no-no-not not re-re-ready yo!  
Not re-re-ready yo!  
We 'bout to drop it steady, yo!  
So do it like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that  
  
(Repeat x2)  
Now why is everybody so petrified?  
(What!)  
Petrified?  
(What!)  
Step aside  
And just drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
  
Yeah  
How you doin', y'all?  
My name's Mike  
I'm fooling with the new shit  
I'm doing it all night  
I like what I do  
I do what I like  
I could quit and get it back like I'm riding a bike  
Like stop  
Bring it back, Bring it back  
  
We got that balance keeping us on track  
That ya' get when 'ya movin quick, with no slow  
You stare like you don't care  
But you do it though I know  
  
I know  
You really must be so lonely  
Puffed up, lookin' tough, but so phony  
You and your boys, you don't know me  
You really wanna hole me? Show me, homie.  
  
Lets get it over with for good  
I got a friction addiction I wish you would  
Machine shop rockin' when we step inside  
And we got everybody so petrified  
  
Now why is everybody so petrified?  
(What!)  
Petrified?  
(What!)  
Step aside  
And just drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
  
Listen you are not ready  
Like children in a building you can't stand steady  
It must be the beat so heavy  
Cos I'm panic attacks like a crack in the levy  
  
Give you that Robert Plant  
Dancing days are back  
Feeling all in the track an' in fact  
For those knowing the name  
I'm back with some brand new crack  
You can do it like that  
  
You really must be so lonely  
Puffed up, lookin' tough, but so phony  
You and your boys, you don't know me  
You really wanna hole me?  
Show me, homie  
  
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing  
You know yourself you know when we're up in a scene  
Its machine shop rockin' when we step inside  
And we got everybody so petrified  
  
(Repeat x2)  
Now why is everybody so petrified?  
(What!)  
Petrified?  
(What!)  
Step aside  
And just drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
  
(Repeat x2)  
No-no-no-not not re-re-ready yo!  
Not re-re-ready yo!  
We 'bout to drop it steady, yo!  
So do it like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that  
(Get up)  
  
(Repeat x2)  
Now why is everybody so petrified?  
(What!)  
Petrified?  
(What!)  
Step aside  
And just drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
Drop that  
(Come on!)  
  
(Reapeat x2)  
Like stop  
Bring it back  
We got that balance keeping us on track  
  
Like Stop stop... Stop... Stop... Stop...  
'Chine shop!
