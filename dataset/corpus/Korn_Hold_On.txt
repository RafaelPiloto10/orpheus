With aversion this distortion  
Came so swiftly  
Cut the cord from this day forward  
We'll be drifting  
  
No direction, no affection  
Watch the soul dive  
You're dissected, resurrected  
Still don't know why  
This illness is like a monster that is  
Eating us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on, be strong  
So right, so wrong  
With all of our senses  
All of our defenses  
Hold on, be strong  
  
New arrival, our survival  
Still not certain  
What's a virtue, where do you go to  
When you're hurting?  
  
It's a weakness, it's a sickness  
In the gene pool  
Show no mercy, people here say  
Kill the damned fool  
This illness is like a monster that is  
Eating us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My  
Soul  
Blood  
Run  
  
Don't ever let me go, no  
Don't ever let me go, no  
Never never let you go, no  
I'll never let you go, no  
  
[Chorus]
