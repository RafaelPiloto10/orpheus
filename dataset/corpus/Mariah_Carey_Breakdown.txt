Krayzie:  
  
Break break down,  
Steady breakin me on down, break break down,  
Steady breakin me on down,  
Break break down, steady breakin me on down,  
Break break down, steady breakin me on down.  
  
Mariah:  
  
You called yesterday to basicallly say  
That you care for me,  
But that you're just not in love  
Immediately I pretended  
To be feeling similarly  
And led you to believe it was O. K  
To just walk away from the one thing  
That's unyielding and sacred to me  
  
Chorus:  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath a disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Mariah:  
  
So what do you do  
When somebody you're so devoted to  
Suddenly just stops loving you  
And it seems they haven't got a clue  
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through  
Do you cling to your pride  
And sing "I will survive"  
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way?"  
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away  
  
Wish:  
  
Yeah, c' mon, yeah, c' mon, c' mon  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath the disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Wish:  
  
It'll break you down  
Only if you let it  
Everday crazy situations rocking my mind  
Tryin' to break me down  
But I won't let it  
Forget it (forget it)  
  
Krayzie:  
  
I be feelin' like you bringing me down  
Taking me around  
Stressin' me out  
I think I better go and get out  
And let me release some stress (stress)  
  
Wish:  
  
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)  
Hoping for the sun  
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)  
Lord, I just wanna maintain  
  
Krayzie:  
  
Yeah, I can feel pressures ya'll  
But never the less  
Krayzie won't fall  
It's over, it's ending here (here)  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath the guise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry
