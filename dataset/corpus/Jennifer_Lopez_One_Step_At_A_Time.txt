You must be thinking how did I get here  
And I wonder if you've been here before  
So many things I want to ask you, and know about you  
You seem like you are ready to run  
Stand right up and walk out that door  
Oh yes you've been here before  
But for this moment you're all mine  
So let's just take it one step at a time  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast  
  
I would spend my lifetime wondering why  
He chose me for you and you for I  
You have things to teach me  
I have a feeling inside  
I have this vision of three of us  
Holding hands  
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky  
  
But one step at a time  
We will take it one step at a time  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast  
  
How can three become one,  
You're the greatest thing tha I've ever done  
I wanna create a world  
You will always want comeback to  
And here's my wish for both of you  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast
