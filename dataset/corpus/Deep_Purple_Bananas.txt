I've got nothing to say today  
I used my words up yesterday  
  
I'm just lying here in the sun  
Watching you guys having fun  
  
Seven days and seven nights  
Working till you got it right  
  
Don't help me I'll help myself  
I'll pull some crackers off the shelf  
  
She had her hair done yesterday  
Now she's coming out to play  
  
First you pull and then you push  
Two in the hand and one in the bush  
  
Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we've  
Been invited  
Now we're going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice  
  
Some will rise and some will fall  
Some will come to nothing at all  
  
The strangest people have the power  
To lead me to my darkest hour  
  
How can you be sure it's me  
When it's payment on delivery  
  
Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we've  
Been invited  
  
Now we're going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice  
  
Now my love is  
Richer than rich  
'Cause I studied  
Mathematics  
  
Graduated  
Without honors  
Everyone has  
Gone Bananas
