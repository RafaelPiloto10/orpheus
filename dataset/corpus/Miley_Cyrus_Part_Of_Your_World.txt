Look at this stuff  
Isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl  
The girl who has everything?  
  
Look at this trove  
Treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Looking around here you think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty  
I've got whozits and whatzits galore  
You want thing-a-ma-bobs?  
I've got twenty!  
But who cares  
No big deal  
I want more  
  
I wanna be where the people are  
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'  
Walkin' around on those - what do you call 'em?  
Feet!  
  
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far  
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'  
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?  
Street!  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?  
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?  
Bet'cha on land they understand  
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women sick of swimmin'  
Ready to stand  
  
I'm ready to know what the people know  
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?  
Burn?  
  
When's it my turn?  
When's it my turn?  
To be  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world
