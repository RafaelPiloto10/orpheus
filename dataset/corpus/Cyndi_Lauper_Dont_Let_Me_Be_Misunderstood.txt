Baby do you understand me now  
If sometimes you see that I'm mad  
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?  
When everything goes wrong I seem bad  
  
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Baby sometimes I'm so carefree  
with a joy that's hard to hide  
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you bound to see my other side  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
That I never meant to take it out on you  
Life has its problems  
and I have my share  
And that's me one thing I never want to do  
  
Baby  
Don't you know I'm human  
I have thoughts like any other one?  
  
Oh when sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little thing  
Some simple thing I've done  
  
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
Please don't let me be misunderstood
