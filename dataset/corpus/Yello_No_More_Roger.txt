Yesterday  
I got that phone  
The streets are empty  
Now I am alone  
Too young to die  
Too old to live  
I gave them  
What I had to give  
  
I know  
They gonna do me in  
I know  
I have had my chance to win  
I know  
I have had my chance to choose  
Tonight  
I know I'm going lose  
  
Too old to live  
Too young to die  
A really silly thing to say  
  
The end of the street  
I feel my heartbeat  
Should I turn left  
Should I turn right  
I'm gonna die  
I stop to fight  
I've had my day  
But that's all right  
  
I know one day I had a friend  
Tonight I think this is my end  
Steps behind  
That's all I hear  
Sweating hand  
Now just fear  
  
He shouts my name  
I turn around  
That's where my body  
Will be found  
Don't ask how  
Don't ask why  
Too old to live  
Too young to die  
A few more seconds  
That's all I got  
I hope he does it with one shot  
With one shot
