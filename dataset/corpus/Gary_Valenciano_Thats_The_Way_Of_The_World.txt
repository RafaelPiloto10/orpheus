Everyday is the same  
Same sorrow and pain  
We laugh and we cry  
We are low and then we get high  
And then we look, and we search  
And we seek to put the pieces  
Of the puzzle together  
Doing our best to keep it all together  
Going 'bout our business  
Seldom thinking of one another  
Hey that's not the only way  
That's the way of the world  
  
Ooh...Yeah...  
(That's the way of the Word)  
(That's the way of the Word)  
  
Has there ever been a time  
When in your mind  
You just felt like giving up  
Wanting to surrender  
You've been tryin' to find your way  
Hopin' that tomorrow would be better  
Much better than today  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home  
If you look in the right place  
You won't be lost out in the storm  
There is a way, the only way  
It will see you through today and tomorrow  
Just believe it in your heart  
  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard about it  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard  
(That's the way of the Word  
Ooh...  
If you believe  
And see with your heart  
And then you will know  
  
Yeah...yeah...ooh...ooh  
  
It's the way of the Word  
You better believe it son  
They say it's the year 2000  
Judgment day will come  
The grand finale, comin' to take you over  
It's the King Almighty, please...  
Forgive us of our sins  
  
Bless us with all your heart  
  
And give me wisdom so I can preach  
All your words to every man, woman  
And child walkin' on the streets  
I ain't got no beef with all ya wanna be  
Ambitious scheming minds  
Read the Bible I suggest and you shall find  
  
Who knows what may happen tomorrow  
Don't fear if you know who you follow  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Never will He leave you alone  
In your heart is where He'll make His home  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
Who knows what tomorrow may bring  
Fear not if you follow the King  
He takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Keeping it high  
Clapping my hands, look in my eye  
Am I telling a lie? No, Let's keep it real  
  
We've come together on this special day  
To sing our message loud and clear  
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days  
Future pass, they disappear  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home  
If you look in the right place  
You won't be lost out in the storm  
There is a way, the only way  
It will see you through today and tomorrow  
Just believe it in your heart  
  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard about it  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard  
(That's the way of the Word  
Ooh  
If you believe  
And see with your heart  
And then you will know  
  
That's the way of the Word  
That's the way of the Word  
That's the way of the Word
