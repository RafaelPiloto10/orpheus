I used to cry myself to sleep at night  
But that was all before she came  
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right  
But now you're here it's not the same  
It's not the same  
  
She builds me up  
She gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
She's all I got  
She's all I got in this world  
And she's all the woman that I need  
  
And in the morning when I kiss her eyes  
She takes me down and rocks me slow  
And in the evening when the moon is high  
She holds me close and won't let go  
She won't let go  
  
She builds me up  
She gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
She's all I got  
She's all I got in this world  
And she's all the woman that I need
