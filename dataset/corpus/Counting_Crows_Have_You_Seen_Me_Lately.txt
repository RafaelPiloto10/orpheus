Get away from me  
This isn't gonna be easy  
But I don't need you  
Believe me  
You got a piece of me  
But it's just a little piece of me  
And I don't need anyone  
And these days I feel like I'm fading away  
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
  
I was out on the radio starting to change  
Somewhere out in America  
It's starting to rain  
Could you tell me the things you remember about me  
And have you seen me lately?  
  
I remember me  
And all the little things  
That make up a memory  
Like she said she loved to watch me sleep  
Like she said,  
"It's the breathing  
It's the breathing in and out and in and..."  
  
Have you seen me lately?
