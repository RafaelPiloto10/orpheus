Under the bridge  
  
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner  
Sometimes I feel like my only friend  
Its the city I live in, the city of angels  
Lonely as I am, together we cry  
  
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion  
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am  
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy  
I never worry, now that is a lie  
  
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way, yea yea yea  
  
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there  
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone  
At least I have her love the city, she loves me  
Lonely as I am, together we cry  
  
And I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way  
And I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way yea yea ye-yea  
Oh no no no  
Yea ye-yea  
Love me I say yea ye-yea  
  
Under the bridge downtown  
Is where I drew some blood  
Under the bridge downtown  
I could not get enough  
Under the bridge downtown  
Forgot about my love  
Under the bridge downtown  
I Gave my life away  
Yeah yeah ye-yeah  
Oh no no no  
Yeah ye-yeah  
Oh no no  
I said yea ye-yea  
I'll stay
