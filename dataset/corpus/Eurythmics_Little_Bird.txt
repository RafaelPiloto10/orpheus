I look up to the little bird  
That glides across the sky  
He sings the clearest melody  
It makes me want to cry  
I makes me want to sit down  
And cry cry cry  
I walk along the city streets  
So dark with rage and fear  
And I...  
I wish that I could be that bird  
And fly away from here  
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here  
But my my I feel so low  
My my where do I go?  
My my what do I know?  
My my we reap what we sow  
They always said that you knew best  
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now  
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed  
So I've just got to put these wings to test  
For I am just troubled soul  
Who's weighted...  
Weighted to the ground  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Till I can lay this burden down  
Give me the strength to lay this burden down down down yea  
Give me the strength to lay it down  
But my my I feel so low  
My my where do I go?  
My my what do I know?  
My my we reap what we sow  
They always said that you knew best  
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now  
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed  
So I've just got to put these wings to test
