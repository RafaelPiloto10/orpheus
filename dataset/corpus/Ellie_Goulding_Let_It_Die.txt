[Verse 1]  
Headlights flashing, cold eyes  
Know your bullets fly through the night  
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors  
I was never yours, never mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All I said was "Hello, hello"  
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time  
And all I said was "Hello, hello"  
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
  
[Verse 2]  
See change whispers in the waves  
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully  
And empires crumble to the shores  
I was never yours, never mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All I said was "Hello, hello"  
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time  
And all I said was "Hello, hello"  
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die
