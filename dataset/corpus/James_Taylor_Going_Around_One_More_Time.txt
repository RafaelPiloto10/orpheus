My heart had been broken and I couldn't take no more.  
I shuttered up my windows and I bolted tight my door.  
Then I took one look at you and I nearly lost my mind.  
  
Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
  
Betty was a little heartbreaker, it didn't quite work out.  
She did a number on my confidence, I was riddled with self doubt.  
I said that's it, I'm through, I quit, then Juanita, she looked so fine.  
  
Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
  
'Round and 'round in a circle, it's always the same.  
One moment you swear you've had enough, the next you've got to know her name.  
All on my own, it wasn't that bad, I was getting by as I could get.  
I stopped into a drug store for one pack of cigarettes.  
She didn't have a quarter, had to call her cousin Kate  
and could I lend her maybe one thin dime?  
  
Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.
