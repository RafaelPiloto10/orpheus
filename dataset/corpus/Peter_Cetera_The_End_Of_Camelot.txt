Here I go again  
Driving to the edge of town  
Need to be alone when I'm thinking  
With no one else around  
I've always been a dreamer  
And from here I dream a lot  
And now I see the end of Camelot  
  
[Chorus]  
If anyone could have a change of heart  
Maybe you could change your mind  
But if you're giving up - If you're letting go  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
Here I go again  
Walking down the same old streets  
I don't want to see anybody  
I want to be discreet  
  
I'm a firm believer  
And I once believed in you  
But now I can't believe all the things  
You're putting me through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not thinking straight - I'm not feeling great  
I'm not sleeping too well  
I'm not doing what I know I can - I can't help myself  
Only time will tell  
  
[Chorus]
