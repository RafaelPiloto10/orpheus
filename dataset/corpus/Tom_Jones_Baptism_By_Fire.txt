I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman  
  
My arms will stay strong  
My love will burn along  
Like the fire in the heart's song  
If she's the right one  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire  
  
'Cause I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman, ooh  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire  
  
Oh, I've searched for you  
So you must know that it's true  
And how I found you  
Yes, I found you  
I'm gonna leave it all up to you  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire
