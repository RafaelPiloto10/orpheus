Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you  
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you  
  
I've been here since dawn of time  
Countless hatreds built my shrine  
I was born in anger's flame  
He was Abel, I was Cain  
I am here  
I'm hell unbound  
Burn your kingdom to the ground  
To the ground  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, it's killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
I return this nightmare, I will find you  
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you  
  
Man has made me oh so strong  
Blurring lines of right and wrong  
Far too late for frail amends  
Now it's come to sweet revenge  
Desperate hands  
That lose control  
Have no mercy on your soul  
On your soul  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, is killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, is killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
Sweet revenge
