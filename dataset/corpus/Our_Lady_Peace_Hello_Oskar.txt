Over there well he's wondering  
Is Oskar there is Oskar all right  
Was never cool not allowed to fit  
He never knew what he liked  
Over there he's the rubberman  
A rubber dress with Betty Page eyes  
Was never cool he'll never settle down  
He's not allowed to drive  
He'll build a bridge then walk around  
Don't ever call him dumb he's not that bright  
He's just not himself  
I will take you somewhere  
Somewhere to unwind  
You're tangled up in all this shit  
I will make you mine  
Over there he's a superstar  
A taxi man and a young Einstein
