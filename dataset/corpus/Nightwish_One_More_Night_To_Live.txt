Safely away from the world  
In a dream, timeless domain  
A child, dreamy eyed,  
Mother's mirror, father's pride  
  
I wish I could come back to you  
Once again feel the rain  
Falling inside me  
Cleaning all that I've become  
  
My home is far but the rest it lies so close  
With my long lost love under the black rose  
You told I had the eyes of a wolf  
Search them and find the beauty of the beast  
  
All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains  
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes  
I wish I had one more night to live  
  
A saint blessed me, drank me deeply  
Spitting out the misery in me  
Still a sinner rapes 1000 saints  
Sharing the the same hell with me  
  
Sanest choice in the insane world:  
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers
