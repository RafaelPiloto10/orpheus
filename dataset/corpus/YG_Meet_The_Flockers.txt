First, you find a house and scope it out  
Find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don't believe in bank accounts  
Second, you find a crew and a driver, someone ring the doorbell  
And someone that ain't scared to do what it do  
Third, you pull up at the spot  
Park, watch, ring the doorbell and knock  
Four, make sure nobody is home  
They gone, okay it's on  
Don't be scared, nigga, you're in now  
If the police come you gonna find out who your friends now  
That ain't them talking, that's your mind playing tricks on you  
You're conscious cause you know you got nines with two clips on you  
But fuck that, motherfuck that plasma  
And fuck that laptop, go and get that jewelry box  
You tryna get paid?  
Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson they'll give you cash back  
  
Meet the motherfucking flockers  
Make some noise if you've ever stole something in your life  
Don't be ashamed, it's okay, baby  
Make some noise if you've ever stole a dollar out your mama's purse  
  
Niggas don't know the history 'bout the fly  
Put the flathead in the door, pull it, make it go fly  
Hit the first drawer, grab a nigga some socks  
That nigga in the car better be listening to that box  
Ay, I ain't staking out shit, nigga  
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe and ding dong ditch  
Ain't a safe I can't crack, nigga, that's on Crip  
I'm with my Pirus from Compton, we gon' pass and get rich  
50 racks, three niggas, 65 a split  
Let some weeks go by, we at the dealership  
I never took notes nigga, I need the pinkslip  
Hit Icy, Mac and Ave for my bullshit  
Spent about ten cash  
Jumped in the whip and did the whole dash  
D-Loc my nigga my nigga, hit my first lick  
Passed with my niggas at!
