The sun comes up, and you're still gone, the world goes round and life goes
on,  
But life is short, and love is long and when the sun goes down you're still  
Gone, now ain't it strange, how we make things right, we think things change  
Overnight, but then the sun comes up and the night moves on and I'm still here  
And you're still gone.  
I guess I missed the point I thought I was doin right, I'd get up early
morning  
And work into the night, I was always makin money, I shoulda been makin love,  
Now the man I'm today knows that money ain't enought, but if I had a chance to  
Give one more thing, it wouldn't be a rose or a diamond ring, cause you showed  
Me where I went wrong, cause I'm still here and you're still gone, hey I guess  
I missed the point I thought I was doin right, I'd get up early in the monrin  
And work into the night, I was always makin money, I shoulda been makin love,  
Now the man I'm today knows that money ain't enough, the sun comes up and  
You're still gone, the world goes round and life goes on, and you showed me  
Where I went wrong, cause I'm still here, your're still gone, yes I'm still  
Here and you're still gone
