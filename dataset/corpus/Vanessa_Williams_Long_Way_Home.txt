It's hard to say from where you stand  
Exactly when it all began  
But someplace there's a point you cross the line  
You see the tears than stain your face  
Mirrored in your make-up case  
And know it's time to leave this place behind  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
Trying to retrace your steps  
It's all too easy to forget  
Just which way to go  
It's a long way home  
  
Outside the sky is threatening  
You slowly gather up your things  
And wonder how you ever will explain  
Walking out so self-assured  
Yeah, you were gonna change the world  
Walking back, a child in the rain  
  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
How can you retrace the steps  
You've been trying to forget  
Still it's time to go  
And it's a long way home  
  
And if you lose your way  
Just keep your eye upon that endless broken line  
  
Throw your bag beneath the bus  
Sit among the curious  
It happens to the best of us, you know  
  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
Starting to retrace your steps  
You learn to live with your regrets  
Next stop heaven knows  
It's a long way home  
Such a long way  
It's a long way home
