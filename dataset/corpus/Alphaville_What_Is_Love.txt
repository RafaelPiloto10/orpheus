What is love ?  
I'm getting closer to her  
And the closer I get  
The more I lose my fear of loneliness  
  
A step outside in the rain,  
They just close the cinemas  
I'm light years away from you as I drive in my car  
And your love shines like a neon sign,  
  
It ain't so far  
But the distance is unbelievable  
What is love: unbelievable  
What is freedom ?  
  
I guess that I'm free again  
I'm so fucking free to decide  
Whether I'm wrong or right, to win or lose  
I love you, I feel like a little boy  
  
Too little to take all your burning love  
And toy land is melting away in the heat
