Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
It's only two o'clock and the temperture's beginning to soar  
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead  
It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored  
And breathing is just no fun anymore  
And then I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
  
You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse  
The subways are steaming and the skin of the street is gleaming with sweat  
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside  
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost  
I think it's time for you to come inside  
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget  
I think it's time for you to come inside  
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget  
  
Come on! come on!  
And there'll be no turning back  
You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back  
Come on! come on!  
It's time to burn up the fuse  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
  
So wander down the ancient hallway  
Taking the stairs only one at a time  
Follow the sound of my heartbeat now  
I'm in the room at the top, you're at the end of the line  
Open the door and lay down on the bed  
The sun is just a ball of desire  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire!
