If you don't open your eyes then you're gonna get hurt  
'cause she keeps telling you lies, she's just a full time flirt  
Now I know I don't count no more  
But you're the one I still care for  
And you won't see me no more if you see that girl  
Now you may think she's fine when she's out with you  
But she only comes around when she's got nothing to do  
I don't want to interfere  
But that girl seems so insincere  
And I won't hang around here if you see that girl  
Do you believe the things that she said to you tonight  
Why can't you see the way she treats you isn't right?  
Now I won't tell you again, it's up to you  
But you'd better make up your mind what you're gonna do  
Don't you know I want you still  
I'm so afraid I always will  
And I'll be loving you till you see that girl  
I'll keep on loving you till you see that girl  
I'll still be loving you till you see that girl  
See that girl  
See that girl
