Santa Maria choose your children  
Santa Maria virgin child  
All our wars over you we are fighting  
And all our time faith justifying  
  
Brother caged Babylon will fall  
Sister chained and bound, beaten and bleeding  
The TV's on, to me this explains it  
Wearing a tie like daddy speaks it  
Screaming from the minarets  
  
Later on we'll all be dancing  
Screaming from the minarets  
Yes indeed I'm making faces  
Rain on the ground in a space  
God has grown  
Alone till a man looking glass in his hand  
He is holding up to you  
  
What you see  
What you see  
What you see  
What you see is human  
Screaming from the minarets
