Miley:  
Nobody listens to me,  
Don't hear a single thing I say,  
Say anythings to me,  
Anything to get you on my head.  
Don't know how I really feel,  
Cause it's the faith  
That makes it like that I don't care  
Don't know how much it hurts  
To turn around like you were never there  
Like somehow you could be replaced  
And I could walk away  
From the promises we made  
And swore we'd never break  
  
(Miley e Travolta)  
Chorus:  
I thought I lost you  
When you ran away  
To try to find me  
I thought I'd never  
Your sweet face again  
I turned around  
And you were gone  
And on and on  
The days went  
I kept the moments  
That we were in  
And I knew in my heart  
That you  
Would come back for me  
My friend  
And now I got you  
When I thought  
I lost you!  
  
Bridge travolta  
I told myself  
I wouldn't sleep  
Till  
I searched the world  
From sea to sea  
  
Miley  
I made a wish upon a star  
I turned around  
And there you were,  
  
Together:  
And now here we are  
  
Miley: Here we are  
I thought I lost you  
  
Travolta:  
I thought I lost You!  
  
Miley: you  
  
Together: Yeh I thought I lost you
