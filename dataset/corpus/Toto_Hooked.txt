Gimme some beer,  
Gimme some fear,  
Reality and fame  
  
Money from you  
Money for them  
Billions being made  
  
You think you got a real deal  
All you're buyin' is a fifth wheel  
They gotcha by the ying yang  
More dollar for the big bang  
  
And when you have to have it  
Somehow you always find away,  
You'll find a way  
Then it becomes a habit  
You'll rob your late friend's grave  
  
It's sex, it's drugs,  
And then we all fall down  
Get hooked,  
On life  
Or join the underground  
  
It's oil, it's guns,  
Bad guys we never see  
It's war, dead sons,  
Be all that you can be  
  
Give it a spin  
Maybe you'll win  
Nobody's gettin paid  
  
Lightin it up  
Shootin it up  
Ya really should be afraid  
  
You're lookin' for a new chin  
So they tighten up your old grin  
All you wanna do is fit in  
So they're gonna make you real thin  
  
It's just enough to tease you  
They nail you right between the eyes  
Nail you right between the eyes  
  
Somehow it will disease you  
While you're lobotomized  
  
It's meds, it's feds,  
Don't need no PhD's  
Load down, those sounds,  
We love our MP3's  
  
It's cribs, it's cars  
Mercedes BNZ  
It's abs, it's carbs  
Stop super-sizing me!  
  
It's sex, it's drugs,  
And then we all fall down  
Get hooked,  
On life  
Or join the underground  
  
It's crips, it's bloods  
It's pimped out S.U.V.'s  
It's court, prime time  
Those lawyer S.O.B.'s  
  
It's X, It's crack  
It's glass and A.D.D.  
It's cool, it's wack  
I'll pay you back  
  
Your kick, you prick  
You get the first one free  
You're cuffed, you're hooked,  
You're hooked.
