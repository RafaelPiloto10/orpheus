Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartache?  
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade?  
All your affections finally fade away  
There will be no use inside  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
One day you'll find out when I'm gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
One day you'll find out when I'm gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?  
There will be no use inside  
Who will next in line for you?  
  
For you, for you, for you  
For you, for you, for you  
For you
