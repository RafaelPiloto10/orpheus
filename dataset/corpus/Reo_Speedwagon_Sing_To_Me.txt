Sundown, summer is fading.  
Run now, here the winter comes.  
Deep down, in some snowdrift.  
Frozen fire, thought you found the lift.  
  
It's a showdown, it's a Mexican standoff.  
And the river, is the prize.  
To float away on her current,  
To the sea lover, to the sea.  
  
And I know there's a song in the wind to the sky.  
And I know there's a song somewhere for you and I.  
What I don't know is if we'll hear it.  
I'm losin' spirit, woman sing to me.
