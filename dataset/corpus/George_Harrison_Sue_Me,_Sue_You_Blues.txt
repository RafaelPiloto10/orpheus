You serve me  
And I'll serve you  
Swing your partners, all get screwed  
Bring your lawyer  
And I'll bring mine  
Get together, and we could have a bad time  
  
It's affidavit swearing time  
Sign it on the dotted line  
Hold your Bible in your hand  
Now all that's left is to  
Find yourself a new band  
  
We're gonna play the sue me, sue  
You blues  
We're gonna play the sue me, sue  
You blues  
  
Hold the block on money flow  
Move it into joint escrow  
Court receiver, laughs, and thrills  
But in the end we just pay those  
Lawyers theit bills  
  
When you serve me  
And I serve you  
Swing your partners, all get screwed  
Bring your lawyer  
And I'll bring mine  
Get together, and we could have  
A bad time  
  
We're gonna play the sue me, sue  
You blues  
  
I'm tired of playing the  
Sue Me, Sue You Blues
