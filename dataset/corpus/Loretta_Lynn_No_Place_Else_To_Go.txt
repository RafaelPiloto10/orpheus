The sun goes down and you come around with evening  
Saying that you love ah but I know  
That it really isn't tenderness you're feelin'  
You're here cause you've got no place else to go  
You'll ask how I've been doin' and you'll smile that same old smile  
You'll touch my cheek and turn the lights down low  
We'll kiss and I'll forget for just a while  
That you're here cause you've got no place else to go  
Ah no place else to go and no place else to be  
No one else to take you in but good old easy me  
When morning comes I tell myself I'll never  
Do this again but deep iseide I know  
I'm here because I'm bound to you forever  
And you're here cause you've got no place else to go  
[ fiddle - steel ]  
I'm here because I'm bound to you forever  
And you're here cause you've got no place else to go
