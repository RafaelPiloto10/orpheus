The stars at night - are big and bright  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The prairie sky - is wide and high  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The sage in bloom - is like perfume  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
Reminds me of - the one I love  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The rabbits rush - around the brush  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The coyotes wail - along the trail  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl  
Deep in the heart of texas.
