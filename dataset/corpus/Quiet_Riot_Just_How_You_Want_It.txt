I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how to give it  
You say you love me, yes you do  
I believe it, 'cause I can see it  
When you hold me, a feelin' inside  
You're givin' and I'm takin'  
I'm there just when you want me  
You know I'll never leave you  
Happens every time I see you  
You got my lovin' in your hands  
Don't shake it, don't break it  
I love you so much, don't you know  
Love thinkin', start dreamin'  
I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how to give it  
I know I know I know (listen)  
What you got is what I need  
I need your love, can't you see  
What you got is up my sleeve  
I won't ever make you plead  
Here I stand, on the ground  
Your love baby, is what I've found  
You say you love me, yes you do  
I believe it, 'cause I can see it  
When you hold me, a feelin' inside  
You're givin' and I'm takin'  
I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how you want it  
I know I know I know I know...  
I know
