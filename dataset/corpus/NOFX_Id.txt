One night, I fell asleep  
A man dressed in black in front of me  
I said "Whatcha going to do to me"?  
He said "I'm gonna set you free  
  
From all the pressures of society  
From all your responsibilities,  
Your bills and your job  
From all the burdens that they put on you  
  
And anything else that you want  
Now every time I look at drugs  
I need a line, I need some stuff  
You need a sell really quick  
  
With anything to get me ripped  
I don't care anymore  
My life is such a bore  
I bet that I look all fried  
Until the day that I die
