[Chorus:]  
Daddy where ever you are remember me  
In what ever you, do I love you  
Daddy where ever you are remember me  
In what ever you do, I love you  
  
You left for the city many years ago  
Promised to come back  
And take care of us  
Many years have gone by now  
Still no sign of you Daddy  
  
Mother died of a heart attack  
Many years ago when she heard  
That you were married again  
Now, I'm the only one left in the family  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wandering up and down  
The streets of Soweto  
No place to call my home  
I tried to find you  
Many years ago  
But the woman you're married to  
was no good at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Daddy yo'  
  
[Chorus]
