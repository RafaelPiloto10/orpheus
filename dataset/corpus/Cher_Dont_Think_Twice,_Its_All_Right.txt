Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
You'll look out your window, and I'll be gone  
You are the reason I'm traveling on  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
The light I never knowed  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
  
Still I wish there was something you could do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
Walking down that long lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can tell  
But good-bye is too good a word, babe  
So I'll just say: "Fair-thee well"  
  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better, I don't mind  
You just sort of wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
Don't you think twice babe, it's all right  
Don't think twice baby, it's all right  
Don't you think twice, it's all right  
Baby, it's all right, it's all right  
Well it's all right, don' think twice
