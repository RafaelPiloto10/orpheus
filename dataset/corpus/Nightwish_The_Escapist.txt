Who's there knocking at my window?  
The owl and the Dead Boy  
This night whispers my name  
All the dying children  
  
Virgin snow beneath my feet  
Painting the world in white  
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale  
  
Come hell or high water  
My search will go on  
Clayborn Voyage without an end  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
That's me locked inside reality's maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone, bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby  
  
Journey homeward bound  
A sound of a dolphin calling  
Tearing off the mask of man  
The tower, my sole guide  
  
This is who I am  
Escapist, paradise seeker  
Farewell, now time to fly  
Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
That's me locked inside reality's maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone, bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby
