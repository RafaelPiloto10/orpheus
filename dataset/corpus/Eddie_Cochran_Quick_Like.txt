Come here pretty baby, yeah you, quick like, quick like  
Gotta hold you near me, yeah quick like, quick like  
Hop-hop, hurry up gal, yeah quick like, yeah  
From the moment that I saw you, you were spinnin' in my brain  
Now you got me boilin' over, won't you ease my pain  
Come here pretty baby, quick like, quick like  
Gotta hold you near me, quick like, quick like  
Hop-hop, hurry up, quick like, quick like  
  
I can hardly keep together, you surprise me to the end  
Won't you move a little faster, like a real cool frail  
Come here pretty baby, quick like, quick like  
Gotta hold you near me, quick like, quick like  
Hop-hop, hurry up, quick like, quick like  
  
You don't know the way you quake to the most upper tree  
If you dig, you move on quick like, start to dig my dream  
Come here pretty baby, quick like, quick like  
Gotta hold you near me, quick like, quick like  
Hop-hop, hurry up, quick like, quick like
