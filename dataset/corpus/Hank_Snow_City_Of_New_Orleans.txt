Ridin' on the City of New Orleans Illinois Central Monday morning rail  
15 cars and 15 restless riders 3 conductors and 24 sacks of mail  
All along the southbound odyssey the train rolls out of Kankakee  
And moves along past houses farms and fields  
  
Passin' trains that have no name and switchyards full of old black men  
Of graveyards full of rusted automobiles  
Good mornin' America how are you say don't ya know me I'm your native son  
I'm a train they call the City of New Orleans  
  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
Dealin' cards with an old man on the club car many a point nobody's keepin'
score  
Hey now pass that paper bag that holds the bottle  
And feel the wheels a rumblin' neath the floor  
  
And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers  
Ride their daddy's magic carpet made of steel  
Mothers with their babies asleep rockin' to that gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
  
Night time on the City of New Orleans changin' cars in Memphis Tennessee  
Half way home and we'll be there by mornin'  
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea  
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream  
  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again the passengers will please refrain  
This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues
