Guess that it was bound to happen  
Was just a matter of time  
But now I've come to my decision  
And it's a-one of the painful kind  
'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr  
Just a regular guy wouldn't do  
But baby I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
Yes, I really got to hand it to you  
'Cause girl you really tried  
But for ev'ry time that we spent laughin'  
There were two times that I cried  
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr  
And that's the one thing I just couldn't do  
'Cause baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
'Cause tables are meant for turnin'  
And people are bound to change  
And bridges are meant for burnin'  
When the people and mem'ries they join aren't the same  
  
So I'll hope that you can find  
Another who can take what I could not  
He'll have to be a super guy  
Or maybe a super god  
'Cause I never was much of a martyr before  
And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new  
And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
'Cause tables are meant for turnin'

Another who can take what I could not
