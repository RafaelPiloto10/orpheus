(It's alright)  
Woooooooh now, let me tell you now  
(It's alright)  
So many times I sat down and cried  
  
(It's alright)  
You know there's no one to dry my weapin' eyes  
(It's alright)  
Baby I'm so in love with you now  
  
(It's alright)  
And yet you broke my heart in two  
Although you've gone away,  
There's nothin' I can say but "it's alright".  
  
(It's alright)  
Baby how could you be so mean?  
(It's alright)  
You know sometimes I feel like I want to scream.  
  
(It's alright)  
Everytime I hear someone call your name now,  
(It's alright)  
You know it almost drives me insane.  
  
(It's alright)  
You took my love and gone,  
And you that we're wrong,  
But it's alright (It's alright)  
  
I wanted to keep on saying sure and (It's alright)  
You know someday you'll need these arms of mine (It's alright)  
I said it make take a long long time (It's alright)  
And when things ain't what they used to be now (It's alright)  
  
You can bring your fine self home to me  
To prove my love is true,  
I'll hug and kiss you too,  
And I'll say "it's alright"  
(It's alright)
