Before you go to sleep  
And close your eyes  
I'd like to kiss you  
One more time  
Touch your lips  
Perhaps your soul  
I'll be still and say no more  
Oh tell me do you feel the same way I do  
  
Well the night was sweet  
You filled the air  
Your gentle hands touched me everywhere  
I don't want this moment to end  
I'm afraid that we can't find it again  
Oh tell me do you feel the same way I do  
Oh tell me do you feel the same way I do  
  
The fragile bond  
Between us here  
Would take to build, a thousand years  
Before you close your eyes  
Just one more kiss  
A million years before we feel like this  
Oh tell me do you feel the same way I do  
Oh tell me do you feel the same way I do  
  
How can I trust my feelings  
In a moment that's always changing  
Tell me do you feel the same way I do  
The same way I do  
  
Hey do you feel  
Yea do you feel  
Hey do you feel  
The same way I do
