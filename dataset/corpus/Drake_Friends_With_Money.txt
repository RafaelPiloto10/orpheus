[Drake:]  
D-D-D-Do That  
  
[Hook:]  
I got friends with money, and I got money too  
So we put it together and let you pick what to do  
And then we do it!  
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)  
Cause we can do it!  
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)  
I got friends with money, and I got money too  
So we put it together and let you pick what to do  
And then we do that!  
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)  
Cuz we can do that!  
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Uh, Focus on women then you get less done  
It's light work, the flow is heavy like a wet sponge  
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think bein broke is less fun  
Celebratin' Father's Day everyday, so don't get sonned  
Where you tryin' to go? I'm ready  
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady  
I'm chillin' out with T, and Jay and Nico  
My city ain't a city that support they own people  
But I run it, you say something' about it? I doubt it  
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it  
I'm bout it, I'm bout it, I'm standin' on these couches  
Sayin' "bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "  
Pardon me that was rude  
If you just started ballin' I say I'm bout to conclude  
What more is there to do? And why would I pretend?  
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND'... Damn.

[Verse 2:]  
Yeah, Look  
Me and 40 wildin', stylin', somewhere on a island  
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in  
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'  
And I'm callin' yo bluff, don't act like you don't me dialin'  
Never embellish, believe him 'cause he exist  
There's stars on my team but I lead the league in assists  
Never been a believer that previously exists  
I wonder what I'd be doin' when previously is this  
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go  
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han  
Don't I treat you better than your ooo-old man  
He couldn't of done it like this sho' 'nuff  
I tend to dro' puff, I'm throwed and I'm high  
I guess I'm thrower up  
Tone it all down, my nigga grow up  
And tell me when you start gettin' paid to show up... Damn.
