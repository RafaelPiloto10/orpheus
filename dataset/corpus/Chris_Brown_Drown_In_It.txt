It don't get no better  
Than my tongue riding your letter  
Feeling you get wetter  
We'll be making love until the morning after  
And I can feel your thigh slowly rising  
As I'm sipping from your water fountain  
  
We gon' flood the bed  
Take it to the ground  
While I'm in your ocean baby  
Hold my head down, down, down  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it, drown in it  
I will never come up, oh  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
High heels in your red lips  
It's fair and high in here  
And I can see a million ways  
For me to surfboard between your waves, girl  
We be going up-down, all around, drip drop, don't stop  
No umbrella, playing in your rain  
Shawty, I'll be slashing in you deeper  
High draining, oh baby  
Come sit that body in my face  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it, drown in it  
I will never come up, oh  
  
[Bridge:]  
Baby, baby, baby  
(Yeah I wanna drown in it)  
Baby, baby, baby  
(Yeah, I wanna drown in it)  
  
Take me under  
I just wanna tell you  
No price compares to what it's worth  
Your pool is like heaven on Earth  
You're screaming while I'm touching your spot  
Oh girl I got your water so high  
I wanna drown in it  
I wanna drown in it baby  
I wanna drown in it baby  
All you gotta do is  
Keep filling me up with your juices  
Keep it right there baby, don't lose it  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it, drown in it  
I will never come up, oh  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just like a male mermaid  
  
I stay thirsty, babe  
Yeah
