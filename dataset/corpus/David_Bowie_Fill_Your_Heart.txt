Fill your heart with love today  
Don't play the game of time  
Things that happened in the past  
Only happened in your mind  
Only in your mind-forget your mind  
And you'll be free-yea'  
The writing's on the wall  
Free-yea'. And you can know it all  
If you choose. Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure [sic]  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free.  
  
Happiness is happening  
The dragons have been bled  
Gentleness is everywhere  
Fear's just in your head  
Only in your head  
Fear is in your head  
Only in your head  
So forget your head  
And you'll be free  
The writing's on the wall  
Free-yea'. And you can know it all  
If you choose. Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free!!  
  
Free-yea'. Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah [repeat]
