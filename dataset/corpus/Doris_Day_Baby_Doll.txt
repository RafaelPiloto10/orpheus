Baby doll, you wonderful baby doll  
Let's go home and tell my mother  
That I found a baby brother  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself  
  
Can't you see it now?  
You're taking me walkin'  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey, there's no use talkin'  
You're a wonderful baby doll  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself  
  
Can't you see it now  
You're taking me walkin'  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey, there's no use talkin'  
You're a wonderful baby doll  
  
A wonderful baby doll
