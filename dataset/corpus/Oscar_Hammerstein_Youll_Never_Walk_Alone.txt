(Nettie)  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet, silver song of the lark  
  
(Chorus sings with Nettie)  
  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone
