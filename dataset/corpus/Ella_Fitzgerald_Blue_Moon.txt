Once upon a time  
Before I took up smiling  
I hated the moonlight!  
Shadows of the night  
That poets find beguiling  
Seemed flat as the moonlight  
With no one to stay up for  
I went to sleep at ten  
Life was a bitter cup  
For the saddest of all men  
  
Once upon a time  
My heart was just an organ  
My life had no mission  
Now that I have you  
To be as rich as Morgan  
Is my one ambition  
Once I awoke at seven  
Hating the morning light  
Now I awake in Heaven  
And all the world's all right  
  
Blue moon you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a pray'r for  
Someone I really could care for  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!  
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!  
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart
