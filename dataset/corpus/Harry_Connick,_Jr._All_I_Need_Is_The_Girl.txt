Got my tweed pressed  
Got my best vest  
  
All I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie  
Got my hopes high  
Oh, I've got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
If she'll just appear  
We'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say  
"My darling, I'm yours," I'll throw away  
My striped tie and my best pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
  
'Look out now.  
You all didn't know I could do that, did you?  
You still don't know I can do that, do you?'  
  
Oh, I've got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
If she'll just appear  
We'll, we'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say  
"Oh Harry, I love ya,"  
Then I'll throw away my striped tie  
I'll throw away my best pressed tweed  
  
'It's a very aqward moment here in the theatre right now.  
You don't know exactly how to act or what to think.  
And I'm in control.  
  
A spattering of applause makes the people yet more uncomfortable.'  
  
Oh I really need (Oh I really need)

All I really need (All I really need)
