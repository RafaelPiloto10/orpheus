[1st verse:]  
I'm not that kind of guy that likes to start trouble no  
But if you push me too far you never know what I might do  
I got a black cat bone and a magic hand, yes I do  
Anf if you don't watch out I'm going to put a spell on you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
[2nd verse:]  
Meet me at Midnight if you like to live dangerously  
I've got some friends down here I really think you should meet  
Oooh, if you're looking for action I'm going to take you there  
Cause there's nothing in this world, nothing I wouldn't dare  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
[Bridge:]  
I got a one way ticket on a sinking ship  
And I'm going straight to hell  
Dead End Kid yeah!
