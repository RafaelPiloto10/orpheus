I thought I knew all it took to bother you  
Every word I said was true that you'll see  
  
How could it be I'm the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity  
  
I still refuse all the methods you've abused  
It's all right if you're confused let me be  
  
I've been around all the pawns  
You've gagged and bound  
They'll come back and knock you down and I'll be free  
  
I've taken all and I've endured  
One day it all will fade  
I'm sure  
  
I don't owe you anything  
  
I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan  
It returns and when it lands words are due  
  
I should've known we were better off alone  
I looked in and I was shown  
You were too  
  
I've taken all and I've endured  
One day it all will fade  
I'm sure  
  
I don't owe you anything  
  
I'll stick around and learn from all that came from it
