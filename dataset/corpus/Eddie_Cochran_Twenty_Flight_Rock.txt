Ooh, well I got a girl with a record machine  
When it comes to rockin' she's the queen  
We love to dance on a Saturday night  
All alone where I can hold her tight  
But she lives on the twentiest floor uptown  
The elevator's broken down  
  
So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four  
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight, more  
Up on the twelfth I started to drag  
Fifteenth floor I'm a-ready to sag  
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock  
  
When she calls me up on the telephone  
Say, come on over honey, I'm all alone  
I said, baby you're mighty sweet  
But I'm in bed with the achin' feet  
This went on for a couple of days  
But I couldn't stay away  
  
Well they sent to Chicago for repairs  
Till it's a-fixed I'm a-usin' the stairs  
Hope they hurry up before it's too late  
Want my baby too much to wait  
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down  
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail  
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight four
