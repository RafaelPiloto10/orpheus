If you hurt me you won't be the first or the last in the lifetime of many
mistakes  
But I won't spend tomorrow regreting the past for the chances that I didn't
take  
Cause I'll never know till it's over if I'm right or I'm wrong loving you  
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done than for something that I
didn't do  
When you touch me it's easy to make me believe tomorrow won't take you away  
But I'll gamble whatever tomorrow might bring for the life that I'm living
today  
Cause I'll never know...
