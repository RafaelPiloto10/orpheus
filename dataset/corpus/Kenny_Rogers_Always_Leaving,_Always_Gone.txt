Dusty dreams of yesterday, of women in the snow  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Reachin' for the sparkle in the yello' afternoon  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
The image of the girl appears there, clearly upon my mind  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Lost among the promises of the days I'll never fi-ind  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
I could hide the pain inside me but what would I win  
I would lose the right to live and turn the pain to si-i-i-in  
So I'll find another way, some other words to sing  
And whether you're stayin' or leavin' baby, I lose everythi-ing  
  
Here I am, another day, just a wonderin' where I'm at  
Always leavin' and always gone  
You fall on my memory but I try to get you there  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
Always leavin', always go-one  
Always leavin', always go-one  
Always leavin', always go-one
