Ooh, but now my world's gone crazy and I think about you all the time

There'll be no ifs ands or maybes, only justice because

For your heart of chrome  
Yeah, you really made a fool outta me  
Everybody knew you used me, but I was just too blind to see  
You taped our sexy conversations and you sold 'em to the BBC  
You told me people can't be trusted, you gotta watch the things they do  
But if you still believe in justice,  
I'm gonna give it to ya, give it to ya  
Ooh!

You told me lies about all that you feel  
I realize now that nothing was real  
You took everything you could beg borrow steal  
Hey, baby (I got an angry soul, I got a broken home)  
I'm gonna stick it in your heart of chrome  
(I got no self-control, you gotta heart of chrome)
