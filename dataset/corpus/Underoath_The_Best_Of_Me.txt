In my mind you never left  
Falling wasn't true  
I had faith you flew past the sky  
Straight through the night  
And the sun reflects the night  
Carrying the very same thing  
In your heart that saved me  
But maybe you've stopped listening  
Falling on my selfish ways  
It takes faith to see  
So close your eyes and search  
Deeper than just memories  
I never stopped believing in you and me  
Your leaving never changed things  
I've been here for too long  
To just walk away
