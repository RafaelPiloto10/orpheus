Well come on pretty baby you know what I like now  
You're shakin' all over and it's feeling alright now  
You're rockin' and rollin' and I don't know what to say  
But daddy's little cat's gonna rock all day  
Well come on pretty woman you know what I mean now  
The beat's just screaming right through' your head  
You're shakin' my heart, you're shakin' my soul -  
I just go crazy when you rock-n-roll  
There you go takin' my love from me  
There you go takin' my love from me  
Drive you home my country rose now  
Hold you tight never let you go now  
Kissing and huggin' outside your door  
Til your pa sees and wants no more
