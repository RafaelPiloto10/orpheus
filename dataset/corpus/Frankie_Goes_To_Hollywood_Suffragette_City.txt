Hey man, oh leave me alone you know

Hey man, I gotta straighten my face  
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place  
Hey man, my schooldays insane

Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam  
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...  
  
Oh don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket  
I'm back on Suffragette City

You know my Suffragette City  
Is outta sight...she's all right  
  
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away  
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way  
Hey man, droogie don't crash here

I'm back on Suffragette City  
Oh don't lean on me man  
'Cause you ain't got time to check it  
You know my Suffragette City
