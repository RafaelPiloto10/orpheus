I'm confessin' that I love you  
Tell me, do you love me too?  
I'm confessin' that I need you  
Honest, honest, I do, I do, oh yeah  
  
In your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
I read such strange things  
But your lips deny that they are true  
Baby, will your answer really change things?  
Making me blue  
  
I'm afraid some day you're gonna leave me  
Saying, why can't we still be friends?  
If you go, you know you're gonna grieve me  
'Cause all my life on you depends  
  
I'm guessing, guessing that you love me  
Dreaming dreams, dreaming dreams, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you
in vain  
Whoa, I'm confessin' that I love you  
Over, over, over, over, and over again  
  
Whoa, I'm afraid some day, some day you're going to leave me  
Saying, baby, can we still be friends, old friends now?  
If you go, if you go, you know you're gonna grieve me  
'Cause all my life on you depends  
  
I'm guessing that you love me, yeah  
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you in
vain  
Oh, I'm confessin' that I love you  
Over and over and over and over and over and over again  
I'm confessin' that I love you over and over and over  
All over again, oh yeah
