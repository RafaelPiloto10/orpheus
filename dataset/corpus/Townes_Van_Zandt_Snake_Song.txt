You can't hold me  
I'm too slippery  
I do no sleepin'  
I get lonely  
You can touch me  
If you want to  
I got poison  
I just might bite you  
  
Lie in circles  
On the sunlight  
Shine like diamonds  
On a dark night  
Ain't no mercy  
In my smilin'  
Only fangs and  
Sweet beguiling  
  
Future, he don't  
Try to find me  
Skin I been through  
Dies behind me  
Solid hollow  
Wrapped in hatred  
Not a drop of  
Venom wasted  
  
You can slip in  
Try to find me  
Hold your breath and  
Flat deny me  
It makes no difference  
To my thinkin'  
I'll be here when  
You start sinkin'.
