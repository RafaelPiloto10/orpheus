As I was motivatin'  
Back in town  
I saw a Cadillac sign  
Sayin' "No Money Down"  
So I eased on my brakes  
And I pulled in the drive  
Gunned my motor twice  
Then I walked inside  
Dealer came to me  
Said "Trade in you Ford  
And I'll put you in a car  
That'll eat up the road  
Just tell me what you want  
And then sign on that line  
And I'll have it brought down to you  
In a hour's time"  
I'm gonna get me a car  
And I'll be headed on down the road  
Then I won't have to worry  
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford  
"Well Mister I want a yellow convertible  
Four - door de Ville  
With a Continental spare  
And a wide chrome wheel  
I want power steering  
And power brakes  
I want a powerful motor  
With a jet off - take  
I want air condition  
I want automatic heat  
And I want a full Murphy bed  
In my back seat  
I want short - wave radio  
I want TV and a phone  
You know I gotta talk to my baby  
When I'm ridin' alone"  
Yes I'm gonna get that car  
And I'm gonna head on down the road  
Yeah, then I won't have to worry  
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford  
"I want four carburetors  
And two straight exhausts  
I'm burnin' aviation fuel  
No matter what the cost  
I want railroad air horns  
And a military spark  
And I want a five - year guarantee  
On everything I got  
I want ten - dollar deductible  
I want twenty dollar notes  
I want thirty thousand liability"  
That's all she wrote  
I got me a car  
And I'm headed on down the road  
No money down  
I don't have to worry  
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford
