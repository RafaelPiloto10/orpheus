I can make the sun shine out of the heavens  
Sweet love, love you forever  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
  
I can change the whole world if you are near me  
No tears if you can hear me  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got, yeah  
  
Ah  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
