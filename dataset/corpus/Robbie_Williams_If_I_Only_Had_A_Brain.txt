I could wile away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consulting with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratching  
While my thoughts were busy hatching  
If I only had a brain  
  
I'd unravel any riddle  
For any individual  
In trouble or in pain  
  
With the thoughts you'd be thinking  
You could be another Lincoln  
If you only had a brain  
  
Oh, I would tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
And then I'd sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothing  
My head all full of stuffing  
My heart all full of pain  
I would dance and be merry  
Life would be a ding-a-derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
I could wile away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consulting with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratching  
While my thoughts were busy hatching  
If I only had a brain
