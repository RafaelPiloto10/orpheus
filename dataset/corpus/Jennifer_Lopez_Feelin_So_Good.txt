We got artist of the year rhyming here  
Grammy nominations and platinum plus ain't nothing baby  
All I want in life, all night long  
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  
  
You priceless, you like diamonds and icey wrists  
We got chedda, I'm twice as rich  
Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless  
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists  
Treat you like a bitch, never that  
We got beef where my niggaz at  
Streets is where I'm living at  
  
Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack  
Where we at, uptown where its really at  
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht  
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop  
Let my hands slip a knot  
  
Joe you the don  
  
Jenny you the bomb  
Any man disrespect, good as gone  
  
When I opened up my eyes today  
Felt the sun shining on my face  
It became so clear to me  
That everything is going my way  
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see  
Got rid of my fears that were holding me  
My endless possibilities  
Has the whole world opened up for me  
That's why I'm feeling  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
Now the day is turning into night  
And everything is still going right  
There's no way you can stop me this time  
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no  
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine  
Anything I want will be mine  
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time  
Call a few friends of mine  
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should (Like I should yeah)  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
Boricua, that's you mamacita  
Puertorican diva, from la isla bonita  
Let me freak ya on the dance floor  
Lead your man off,  
He's just trying to get your pants off  
  
That's the last straw  
Pun I ain't got a glass jaw  
Better run when you see me coming through the back door  
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother  
There's to things I don't share  
That's my money and my mother  
  
I love honeys since the paradise for real  
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real  
  
Shut up your grill  
You know we never fight  
It's your world girl, set it off right  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
And nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
I'm feelin' so  
  
Party all the night  
Everything is feelin' right DJ  
Party all the night  
Everything is feelin' right DJ  
The world's gonna treat me right  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should (Play my song for me)  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
And nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing
