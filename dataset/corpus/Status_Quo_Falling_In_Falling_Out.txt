Oh no I took your number down  
Now I can't find it and I'm back in town  
Tonight tonight  
I can't believe where the hell it's gone  
And looking for a lover won't be too much fun  
Tonight tonight  
  
I'm standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know I'd feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm falling in, falling out  
I still don't know what it's all about  
I'm falling in, falling out  
I'm creeping in, but I'm crawling out again  
Falling in, falling out  
I'm giving up, so I'm calling out to you  
  
I bet you're thinking you where just a game  
I bet you bet I can't recall your name  
Tonight tonight  
How can I tell if I can't get through?  
How can I make it if I'm not with you?  
Tonight tonight  
  
I'm standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know I'd feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
[Chorus: x3]
