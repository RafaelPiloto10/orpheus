Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
I keep looking for something  
I can't get broken hearts lie all around me  
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this  
Her diary it sits on the bedside table  
The curtains are closed  
The cats in the cradle who would've thought  
That a boy like me could come to this  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
  
It must've been some kind of kiss I should've walked away  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?  
On the surface I'm a name on a list I try to be discreet  
But then blow it again  
I've lost and found  
It's my final mistake she's loving by proxy  
No give and all take 'cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms...  
It was a long hot night she made it easy  
She made it feel right  
But now it's over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head  
I know I was wrong  
Oh I, I just died in your arms...
