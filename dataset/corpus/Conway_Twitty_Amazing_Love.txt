When she wakes up this morning and turns to kiss me  
She'll find I let her sleep 'cause we talked so late last night  
She'll know I kissed her face gently till my returning  
And when she finds the rose on my pillow, I know she'll smile  
  
Her amazing love, unending  
Is so much more than I am worthy of  
If the rose could speak my feelings  
She'd know I cherished her amazing love  
  
If I call her a little late she forgives me  
Her voice does not betray, she's spent another day alone  
She softly thanks me for the rose and says, I miss you  
And then I can feel her smiling on the phone  
  
Her amazing love, unending  
Is so much more than I am worthy of  
If the rose could speak my feelings  
She'd know, I cherished her amazing love [unverified]
