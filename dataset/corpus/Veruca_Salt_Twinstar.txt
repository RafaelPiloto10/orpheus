Flying, when all I want to do is die  
Feels like your, flyin'  
Oh God, I wish that I could, fly  
You want to lift me up  
But you don't know, and you don't see...  
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways, oh.  
Breathing, when all I want to do is drown.  
You keep on breathing and I keep on sinking down, oh, oh.  
You want to lift me up,  
But you don't know, and you don't see...  
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways  
I'm stuck in my ways, oh.  
You want to lift me up,  
But you don't know, and you don't see...  
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways  
I'm stuck in my ways, oh.
