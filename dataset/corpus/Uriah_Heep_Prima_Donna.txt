I'll go down fightin'  
But rather be delightin'  
All the people that come to see  
The Devil's from Chicago  
Now where the hell do they go  
When we get in our limousines  
  
'Cause we just want to be  
Where it's all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When it's over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
They're gone  
I said they're gone  
  
You're our kind of people  
You're the church  
And we're the steeple  
But we're all inside the hall  
If we've got what you need  
Then we'll give you the speed  
To get up and have a ball  
  
'Cause we just want to be  
Where it's all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When it's over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
  
You're just another  
Prima Donna of rock 'n' roll  
So please let me know  
When you want me to go
