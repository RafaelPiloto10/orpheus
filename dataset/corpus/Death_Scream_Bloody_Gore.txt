Decapitated head licking your cunt  
Sucking all the blood from your stump  
Intestinal guts taking their hold  
Leaving you dead, stiff and cold  
  
Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead  
Unholy seizure slicing through your head  
Who will survive only time will tell  
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell  
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh  
Leaving your body a bloody mess  
  
Scream bloody gore  
Scream bloody gore  
  
Inject the reborn terror, the blood comes spurting out  
Another to control, add it to your count  
Orders to destroy, rip and tear apart  
Wishing for the end, your dead is just the start  
  
Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead  
Unholy seizure slicing through your head  
Who will survive only time will tell  
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell  
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh  
Leaving your body a bloody mess  
  
Scream bloody gore  
Scream bloody gore  
  
Armies of the dead  
Hail their leader's head  
Hungry for the flesh  
While it's warm and fresh  
  
Through the smoke who will see  
Who will come out alive?  
Now it's your turn to feel the pain  
Now it's your turn to die
