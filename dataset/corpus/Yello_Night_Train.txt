I'm riding the night train  
The smile is still burning  
Dancing my way  
?  
A crown for the clown, I smile, and I run  
  
For years now I'm driven  
A smile, unforgiven  
I'm dancing with strangers  
?  
Awaiting your big smile,  
I'm rushing downtown while you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one  
  
I'm riding the night train  
The window's a mirror  
I'm dancing with strangers  
I'm waiting...for you  
  
Awaiting your big smile,  
I'm rushing downtown while you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one  
A crown for the clown, a smiling crowd, and you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one
