Some folks trust to reason, others trust to might  
I don't trust to nothing, but I know it come out right  
Say it once again now, whoa I hope you'll understand  
When it's done and over, Lord, a man is just a man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Playing, playing in the band  
Daybreak, daybreak on the land  
  
Some folks look for answers, others look for fights  
Some folks up in tree tops, just to look to see the sights  
(just looking for their kites)  
I can tell your future, whoa just look what's in your hand  
I can't stop for nothing, I'm just playing in the band  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Standing on a tower, world at my command  
You just keep a-turning, while I'm playing in the band  
If a man among you, got no sin upon his hand  
Let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band  
  
Playing, like a wave upon the sand
