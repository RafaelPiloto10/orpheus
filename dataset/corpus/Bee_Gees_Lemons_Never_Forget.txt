Incidentally there should some changes made.  
You've got to work if you should have to save.  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.  
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.  
  
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear.  
You've got to take it easy if you dare.  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.  
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.  
  
Don't be blind you've got a thinking mind.  
Stop the bells that ring so loud.  
Don't nod your head you'll draw a crowd.  
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring.  
The lemon sings my song  
He's known it all along.
