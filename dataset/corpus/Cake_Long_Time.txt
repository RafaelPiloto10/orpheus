It's been a long time  
Since I've seen your smiling face  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen a sunny day  
  
It's been a long time  
Since you wore your pillbox hat  
It's been a long time  
Since we drove your Pontiac  
  
It's been a long time  
Since you gave me butterflies  
It's been a long time  
Since I seen it burning in your eyes  
But I don't mind (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
When I've got you next to me  
  
It's been a long time  
Since we tripped into this ditch  
It's been a long time  
Since we drank the a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-arsenic  
  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been inside of this tomb  
It's been a long time  
Since you wore your expensive French perfume  
But I don't mind (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
When I've got you next to me  
  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen your smiling face  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen a sunny day
