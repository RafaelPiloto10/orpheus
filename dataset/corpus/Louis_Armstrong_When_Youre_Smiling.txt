When you smilin', when you smilin  
The whole world smiles with you.  
Yes when you laughin' oh when you laughin'  
The sun comes shinin through.  
  
But when you cryin', you bring on the rain  
So stop your sighin baby, and be happy again  
Keep on smilin, keep on smilin baby,  
And the whole world smiles with you  
  
Oh when you're smilin' keep on smilin'  
The whole world smiles with you  
Ah when you're laughin' keep on laughin'  
The sun comes shinin' through  
  
Now when you're cryin' you bring on the rain  
So stop that sighin' be happy again  
Keep on smilin Cause when you're smilin'  
And the whole world smiles with you  
  
The great big world will smile with  
  
The whole wide world will smile with you
