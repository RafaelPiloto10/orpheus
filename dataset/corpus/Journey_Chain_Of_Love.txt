One precious moment in a state of grace  
Send the mantra to an endless night  
Feel the glow, feel the peace of mind  
True perfection in one true light  
  
Pathways in my mind that lead to nowhere  
Promises of happiness that leave me wanting more  
When my desire becomes a nightmare  
Feel paranoia about what I'm wishing for  
If I could just let go of who I think I am  
Surrender to the silence, help me understand  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love  
  
Voices in my head that try to rule me  
I've found a place where I can't hear them anymore  
My own illusions come to fool me  
Lost in emotions that I've never touched before  
If I could get beyond what's in my mind  
Free my spirit, leave the world behind  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love  
  
One precious moment in a state of grace  
Send the mantra to an endless night  
Feel the glow, feel the peace of mind  
True perfection in one true light  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love
