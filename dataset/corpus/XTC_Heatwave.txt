She likes it hot  
She likes a tan  
She steals my infra red when I'm gone  
Oh no can it be  
We're heading for a heatwave  
  
Her legs are brown  
A trace of rust  
She's in love with a mkii deluxe  
Oh no can it be we're heading for a heatwave  
  
Her hair is bleached like it's been boiled  
She browns herself in a sea of olive oil  
And I come around and she's relaxing  
In the conservatory
