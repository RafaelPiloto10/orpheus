She thought she had the only key  
She thought you only opened up to her, well you see  
I don't know why you call it love  
She thought she was the brightest light  
But someone else was lighting up your life, what I think  
I don't know why you call it love  
  
I'm not suspicious, no not me, but I'm not blind  
And I'd have to be not to see  
  
[Chorus]  
Gettin' away with murder, you can love a girl and hurt her  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
You can tell a girl you love her, while you're working on another  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
  
You have had to love and run  
Two in the hand has left you holding none, and I don't  
I don't know how you call it love, no, no  
  
You're not demanding, no not you, you're understanding  
You do what you want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said she was the only one, but you were cheating all along  
There ought to be a law for what you've done  
  
I got to save you from yourself, I got to stop you from hurtin' someone else  
  
[Chorus]
