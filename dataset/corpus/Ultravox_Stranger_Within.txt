Light comes through a crack in the door  
I tape up the windows once more  
Tight like a cold hand of steel  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Hands that petrify in the air  
Eyes catching things never there  
Sweet tension caught on my breath  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Watch every shape that escapes  
Scared to make the final mistake  
Speak to hear the sound of your voice  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Sit in the corner with your back to the wall  
Pray to your God with your head in your hands  
Your mask of fear is shrinking fast  
It's closing in more amour  
You stand on borrowed time, your sweating palms and chilling brow  
Your wide-eyed panic makes you laugh, you cry and laugh  
Freeze until the noise decays, a shuffle from behind a door  
Your throat is tight, it makes you choke and smoke and choke  
Eyes will grow accustomed to the dark, a stifled scream that won't come out  
There's nothing more to fear from the stranger within  
Don't fear the stranger within  
I feel the stranger within  
I see the stranger within  
Don't know the stranger within  
I am the stranger within  
I am the stranger within
