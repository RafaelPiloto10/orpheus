From the time that I wake to the time that I rise, she's a lover and so am I  
But the lady loves her passion more than me  
When I'm under her spell, then I know very well, how her magic can mystify  
And the lady leaves her lovers in ecstasy  
She's young, but she's wise, and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance  
Is as much as a man can see  
But she'll never really love any more than any other lover in her life  
And you'll come to know the devil in Angelique  
For a moment it seems I'm a part of her dreams  
And she loves like she's hypnotized  
While she hides inside the man she's made of me  
And then just when I've found her, her visions surround her  
And I'll never fill her eyes, but I wonder who in hell the young girl sees  
And she moans, and she sighs, and you search inside her eyes  
But all you find is a man who can never be  
And you wonder if she'll ever discover that the devil could never set her free  
She's young, but she's wise, and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance  
Is as much as any man can see  
And you'll never really lose any more than any other lover has lost in her
life  
When you've come to know the devil in Angelique  
And you'll come to know the devil in Angelique  
And you'll learn to love the devil
