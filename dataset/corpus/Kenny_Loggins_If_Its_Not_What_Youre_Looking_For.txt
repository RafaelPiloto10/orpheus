What you thinkin' of?  
Darlin', you've been with me every day  
But you seem so far away, I know  
No, it's never enough  
To smile and say there's something on your mind  
If you doubt my love  
Know that it's here all the time  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
Girl, I'll give you anything you want  
Girl it's been so right  
Nobody could ever love you more  
I've never been more sure  
Where in the middle of the night  
I hold you near  
And take your heart in my arms  
Swearin' all my love  
That's something you've known from the start  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
I'll give you anything you want  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
Know that you're free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got  
Hold me, oh, hold me tonight  
Forever, here, my love  
So you'll never fly away  
Gotta work it out  
I'm tryin' to hold on to our romance  
We've only got one more chance I know  
So tell me what it's all about  
Oh, darlin', if there's still a way to your heart  
I'll use all my love to keep us from fallin' apart  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
I'll give you everything you want  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
Know that you're free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got
