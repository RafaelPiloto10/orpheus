At the end of a rainbow  
You'll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
You'll find it's all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our heart's can't always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops it's flow  
At the end of a highway  
There's no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on 'til the end of time  
  
At the end of the rainbow  
You'll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
You'll find it's all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our heart's can't always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops it's flow  
At the end of a highway  
There's no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on  
'Til the e-end of time  
  
'Til the end of time ...
