All dressed up  
No place to go  
Hey monkey, when you gonna show your face around me?  
I know all the wrongs and rights  
And I just want a little light to fall on me  
  
Hey monkey, where you been?  
This lonely spiral I've been in  
Hey monkey, when can we begin?  
Hey monkey, where you been?  
  
We'll I'm all messed up  
That's nothing new  
Hey monkey, when you open up your blue eyes,  
I don't know if I'm wide awake or dreaming  
But all I ever need is everything  
  
Hey monkey, where you been?  
This lonely spiral I've been in  
Hey monkey, when can we begin?  
Hey monkey, where you been?  
  
Just get the world off your shoulders  
and close your pretty blue eyes  
Hey monkey, what's life without an occasional surprise?  
  
Got nowhere but home to go  
Got Ben Folds on my radio right now  
I'm in trouble for the things I need  
Hey monkey don't you want to be needed too?  
  
Hey monkey, where you been?  
This lonely spiral I've been in  
Hey monkey, when can we begin?  
Hey monkey, where you been?
