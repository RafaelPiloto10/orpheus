Do you think I'm crazy  
For considering aviation  
I'm the fan of flying  
Wanna do it for the nation  
Cause I have nothing else to do  
It's summer but committed to you  
Have a big degree in philosophy  
But I don't know what I wanna be  
  
[Chorus:]  
So I'm going into aviation, yeah mom  
I'm going into aviation, yeah dad  
Going into aviation,  
I'm going into aviation  
  
Do you think I'm crazy, cause I'm up and living baby  
Well I ain't got nobody and I ain't got no money baby  
I feel high as I might tonight  
So lean back and enjoy the flight  
And the weather is clear yeah, nobody's near  
The future is... Here  
  
[Chorus:]  
So I'm going into aviation, yeah mom  
I'm going into aviation, yeah dad  
Going into aviation,  
I'm going into aviation  
  
Do you think I'm crazy  
Cause I'm going to pensacola  
Where nobody knows me  
Where someone could just start over, mhm  
I'll be alright in a month or two  
Cause it's warm there in the winter too  
Think new york is great, I really like the state  
But it's time to be on my way  
  
[Chorus:]  
So I'm going into aviation, yeah mom  
I'm going into aviation, yeah dad  
Going into aviation,  
I'm going into aviation
