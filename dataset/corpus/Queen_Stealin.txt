This is the way I lead my life - you know  
Wheelin and dealin  
And a little bit of stealin  
You know thats the way I grew up  
Thats the only life I know  
Thats the way my mother taught me  
There you go  
  
Stealin  
I gave you the key to my home  
I left you alone in charge of my heart  
Hey stealin
