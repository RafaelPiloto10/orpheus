Yes I know how much you love me  
but can't you realize I'd cause you just pain  
cause men like me capricious and free  
live life alone and confused  
yet loving whoever they choose  
  
yes I know how much you need me  
but I just patronize with this affair  
cause all my life I've needed to be  
a man with a mind full of craves  
living to learn from each phase  
  
love me now while I'm here  
love you this man  
take me as I am  
the storm in your life  
  
And hear me out I've something to say  
love is a moment in time  
and now that it's yours and it's mine  
love me now while i'm here  
love you this man  
take me as I am  
the storm in your life
