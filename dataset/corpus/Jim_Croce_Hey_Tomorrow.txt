Hey tomorrow, where are you goin'  
Do you have some room for me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
  
Hey tomorrow, I can't show you nothin'  
You've seen it all pass by your door  
So many times I said I been changin'  
Then slipped into patterns of what happened before  
  
'Cause I've been wasted and I've over-tasted  
All the things that life gave to me  
And I've been trusted, abused and busted  
And I've been taken by those close to me  
  
Hey tomorrow you've gotta believe that  
I'm through wastin' what's left of me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
  
Hey tomorrow, where are you goin'  
Do you have some room for me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me
