I take her to the aquarium, she says shark  
I take her to the planetarium, she says dark  
I take her to the seaside  
Where she likes to spin and twirl  
She says sure and cool and yeah  
She's my monosyllabic girl  
  
I take her to the university, she says huh  
I take her to anniversary, she says one  
I take her to jewelry store  
I say diamonds, she says pearl  
Oh everyone knows I'm in love  
With a monosyllabic girl
