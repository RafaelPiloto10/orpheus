Somebody let me down  
Somebody show me love  
I wouldn't care much either way  
I'd rather the sticks and stones  
Than dragging the ball and chain  
Of what if the world won't take me?  
Even if the holes should crack  
And even if the blood flows red  
Nothing could be worse than numb  
  
So, please, use me up  
I just want anyone to use me up  
'Cause no one ever does  
Use me up  
  
I've carried it all too long  
The fear of the pain it brings  
Feeling the panic building up  
I'd rather the broken heart  
Than live in the emptiness  
Of what if the world won't save me?  
Even if the bow should break  
Even if the blood runs cold  
Nothing could be worse than numb  
  
Please, use me up  
I just want anyone to use me up  
'Cause no one ever does  
Use me up  
Use me up  
  
Treat me somewhat cruel  
You can throw me away  
As long as I feel it  
Show me something real  
You can deceive me  
I am yours to use  
Use me up  
Use me up  
Use me up
