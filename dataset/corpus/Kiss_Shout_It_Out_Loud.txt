Well the night's begun and you want some fun  
Do you think you're gonna find it  
You got to treat yourself like number one  
Do you need to be reminded  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
Just forget the things that you've been told  
We can't do it any other way  
Ev'rybody's got to rock n roll yay  
  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud  
  
If you don't feel good ev'ry way you could  
Don't sit there broken hearted  
Call all your friends in the neighborhood  
And get the party started  
Don't let them tell you that there's too much noise  
They're too old to really understand  
You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys  
Cause it's time for you to take a stand yay  
  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
