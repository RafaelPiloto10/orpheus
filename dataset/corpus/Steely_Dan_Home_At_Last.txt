I know this super highway  
This bright familiar sun  
I guess that I'm the lucky one  
Who wrote that tired sea song  
Set on this peaceful shore  
You think you've heard this one before  
  
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past  
Still I remain tied to the mast  
Could it be that I have found my home at last  
Home at last  
  
She serves the smooth retsina  
She keeps me safe and warm  
It's just the calm before the storm  
Call in my reservation  
So long hey thanks my friend  
I guess I'll try my luck again  
  
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past  
Still I remain tied to the mast  
Could it be that I have found my home at last  
Home at last
