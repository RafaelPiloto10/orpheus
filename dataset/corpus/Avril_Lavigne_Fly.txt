[Verse 1]  
There's a light inside of all of us  
It's never hiding, you just have to light it  
It's the one thing that you gotta trust  
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it  
So if you ever feel like giving up  
Yeah, just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
We were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly  
Your time to fly  
  
[Verse 2]  
A little help is all it ever takes  
Somebody has to tell you it's worth fighting  
A single step becomes a leap of faith  
That's when you realize you started flying  
So don't you ever say you're giving up  
No, there's no looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've touched the sky  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've realized  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
That we were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
It's you time to shine, shine  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
(Spread your wings across the universe)  
It's your time to shine, shine  
(There's a light inside of all of us)  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly
