Everybody wants a little piece of my time  
But still I put you at the end of the line  
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain  
To see the tears you cry fallin' like rain  
  
Give me the chance to prove  
And I'll make it up to you  
  
I still believe in you  
With a love that will always be  
Standing so strong and true  
Baby I still believe in you and me  
  
Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track  
Only thinkin' of myself never lookin' back  
For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize  
I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize  
  
Give me the chance to prove  
That nothing's worth losing you  
  
I still believe in you  
With a love that will always be  
Standing so strong and true  
Baby I still believe in you and me
