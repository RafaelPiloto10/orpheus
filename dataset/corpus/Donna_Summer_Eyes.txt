Right outside the window something's happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...
