I wasn't there for you  
I wasn't there for you  
I know weather's gonna be fine  
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline  
My love waits for me in daytime  
But I can't see you through the snow blind  
  
But I wasn't there for you  
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye (I wasn't there for you)  
Goodbye  
I wasn't there for goodbye  
I wasn't there for goodbye  
  
Well, I know time reveals in hindsight  
I can hand wrestle with the stormy night  
Because your love lasts a lifetime  
But I can see you through the snow blind  
  
But I wasn't there for you  
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)  
Goodbyes are long  
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye  
  
I wasn't there for you  
I wasn't there  
I wasn't there for you  
I wasn't there for you  
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
