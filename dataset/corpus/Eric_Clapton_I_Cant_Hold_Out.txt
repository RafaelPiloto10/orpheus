I just talked to my baby on the telephone,  
She said, "Stop what you're doing and baby come on home."  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't hold out,  
I can't hold out too long.  
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.  
  
You said, "Baby don't you worry, you're my heart's desire.  
You know that I love you, I can't stand to see you cry."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said, "Baby you can run, you can walk or fly.  
You know that I love you, you're my heart's desire."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.  
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.  
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.
