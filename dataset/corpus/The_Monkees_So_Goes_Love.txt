Girl, this is goodbye for us  
I'm afraid there's no two ways about it  
Now you say you need my love, But you'll just have to learn to live without it  
So goes love  
Don't try to understand it  
So goes Love  
It never goes the way you planned it  
  
When you meant the world to me  
that's the time you said you didn't want me  
You played around in front of me  
Yeah, you did everything you could to taunt me  
  
So goes love  
Don't try to understand it  
So goes Love  
When it dies you can't disguise it  
  
It's been said you've made your bed  
And now you have to lie in it  
there's no denying its a shame  
But there's really no one else for you to blame  
  
So goes love  
Don't try to understand it  
So goes love  
It never goes the way you planned it
