LOVING YOU  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel  
And I love how loving you feels so real  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh Loving you than anything else  
  
All my life I've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white  
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you  
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes  
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real baby  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)  
  
All my life I've wondered if I'd hear all the bells and whistles  
If the one should come my way  
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake  
Making me a believer there must be a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch  
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for  
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world  
  
Cus I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real so real  
Through the good through the bad the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel  
And I love how loving you feels so real  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
