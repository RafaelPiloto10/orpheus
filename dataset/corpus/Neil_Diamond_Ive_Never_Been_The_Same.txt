I was just another lonely guy  
Searching for my lucky star in vain  
And then just one day  
You just happened by  
And I've never been the same  
  
Nights just don't seem as long  
When you're around  
I don't walk alone down lover's lane  
You just picked me up when I was down  
And I've never been the same  
  
I never realized what I was missing  
Until I came to know  
The magic of your charms  
I used to spend my nights  
Alone just wishing  
But now I'll spend my time  
Alone in your arms  
  
You must be an angel in disguise  
My head's been in the clouds  
Since you first came  
You showed me the way to paradise  
And I've never been the same  
  
No, no, no, no  
I've never been the same  
Well, you know  
I've never been the same  
No, no, no, no  
I've never been the same
