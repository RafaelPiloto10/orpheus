It's over today  
The heat is gone  
Time is gone  
F for fake  
I feel no wrong  
Hide no wrong  
I love this place  
The lights  
Under this face  
So dry  
  
Only way to change  
Give yourself away  
Don't be ashamed  
Next in line  
Close one eye  
Just walk by  
  
In these days  
I'm breathing stone  
Crying alone  
I'll win this race  
I'll leave alone  
Arrive alone.  
  
Love this place  
The lights  
Under this face  
So dry  
  
Stripped to the bone  
I did no wrong  
Truth is my name  
Give yourself away  
  
F for fake  
F for fake  
F for fake  
F for fake  
Give yourself away  
Give yourself away  
Give yourself away
