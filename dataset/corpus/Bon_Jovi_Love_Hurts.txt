Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and harms  
Any heart not tough or strong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
'Cause I'm young, I know but even so  
I know a thing or two, that I've learned from you  
Really learned a lot, really taught me a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns yourself when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves, I guess  
They ain't foolin' me I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true  
Love is like a flame, makes your heart so blue  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee yes, love hurts  
Ooeee-ooeee yes, love hurts, love hurts  
  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts
