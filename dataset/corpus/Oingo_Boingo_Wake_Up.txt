Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Won't you listen to me  
  
Big brother's watching, we watch him back  
We see right through his disguise  
He tries to scare us, with angry words  
But we all know that they're lies  
Whole world is waiting  
Just see the fear in their eyes  
  
Whole world is watching, observing every move  
Is it beginning or the end?  
Just like a chess game, but so intense  
That I just don't understand  
Anticipation  
It's much to big to pretend  
  
Chorus  
(wake up), it's 1984  
(wake up), but we've been here before  
(wake up), it's 1984  
(wake up), but we've been here before, (here before)  
  
Big brother's screaming but we don't care  
Cause he's got nothing to say  
Think of the future, think of the prophecy  
Think of the children of today  
Big brother's marching  
So we all stand in his way  
Open your eyes, sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised, so far away  
Open your heart, try to remember  
Two worlds apart, but so close  
  
(wake up), it's 1984  
But we've been here before  
(wake up), it's 1984  
But we've been here before  
All our lives leading up to this day, watching and waiting  
  
Wake up! Wake up!  
Wake up! Wake up!  
  
Open your eyes, sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised, so far away  
Open your heart, try to remember  
Two worlds apart, but so close  
  
Chorus  
  
Whole world is watching  
Anticipating  
Big brother's marching  
Is it beginning or the end?  
  
Chorus
