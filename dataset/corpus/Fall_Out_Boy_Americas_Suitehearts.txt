You could have knocked me out with a  
(Feather)  
I know you've heard this all before, but were just Hell's  
(Neighbors)  
Why-why-why won't the world revolve around me?  
Build my dreams  
Trees grow all over the streets  
  
But I don't know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke  
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike,  
Media blitz  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts  
But I must confess  
I'm in love with my own sins  
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts  
But I must confess  
I'm in love with my own sins  
  
You can bow and pretend  
That you don't, don't know you're a legend oh  
Time, time, time, hasn't told  
Anyone else, yeah  
Let my love loose again  
  
But I don't know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck classic coke  
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike  
Media blitz  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could have knocked me out with a feather  
I know you heard this all before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suitehearts, suitehearts, suitehearts (suitehearts)
