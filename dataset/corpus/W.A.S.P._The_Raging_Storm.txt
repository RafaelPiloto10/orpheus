[Jesse to God]  
  
A storm is come  
One war of sun and rain - within me  
A raging storm  
Lost crossroads thundering - in the wind  
Dark and son  
Who's the only one  
To lay claim of me  
Altars of store  
Righteous temptations  
Here at my feet  
  
Give me love  
To rage in me can you see?  
Only love  
Is saving me  
Give me love, oh love  
That rage in me  
  
It rages on  
Of mourn and memories  
In the wind  
A warring storm  
My soul is bargaining - in the end  
Is there no sun?  
With only love in vain - and it's pain  
Hear me oh Lord  
Cleanse me evermore with  
Your blood of rain  
  
Holy war for my soul  
Scares of memories remain  
Oh, tell me why am I here  
Storms of crossroads are rage
