Power station by the river  
Grinding slowly to a stop  
Clock still ticking on the mantle  
Flames still flicker on the log  
Coffee brewing in the kitchen  
Where the door is open wide  
Glass upon a hovered carpet  
Eyes are glowing in the night  
  
It's the silence you can see  
Hearing shadows behind me  
  
All the buildings standing empty  
All the trains are standing still  
Cars are scattered by the roadside  
There's no top upon the hill  
Nails have scratched upon the outside  
Of the empty chapel door  
But i don't think that the father  
  
Wants to live there anymore  
There's no bone for you to pick  
No more wax around the wick  
  
Shot the arrow from the circle  
At the apple on the tree  
From a garden that was eden  
Strange the fruit it bears for me  
And the wind will spread the fire  
And the rain will ever fall  
If no one reads the writing  
That's been written on the wall  
  
Underneath the apple tree  
There's a ghost who waits for me  
  
The apple tree shakes its arms  
Its fruit falls  
Its fruits are tasting strange  
The apple tree is shaking
