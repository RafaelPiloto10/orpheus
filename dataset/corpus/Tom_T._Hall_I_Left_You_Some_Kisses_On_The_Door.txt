(I left you some kisses on the door)  
Your mama says I can't see you the judge says that it's right  
We can't be together cause me and mommie fights  
But you're my little girl and daddy loves you more and more  
  
And I left you some kisses on the door  
I came by to see you but mommie just said no  
I knocked but mommie saw me as she peeked through the hole  
I only want to hold you honey mommie thinks it's war  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
You know your daddy worries honey but it's not mama's fault  
You do what your mommie says you know that she's the boss  
No matter what I gave you mommie thought you needed more  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
Hey you're my little angel babe and it don't make much sense  
To only get to watch you play through that old schoolyard fence  
Someday you'll come to me sweetheart that's all I'm waitin' for  
'Cause I left you some kisses on the door
