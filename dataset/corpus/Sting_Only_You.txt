Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
  
We thank you, father in heaven  
Who sings all young songs of love  
Let us bow before the Messiah  
Jesus, save us from the darkness of human hearts  
Help us to understand the purpose of Your pain and suffering  
Help us to see the beauty of the least of Thy creatures  
Impart on us thy infinitely complex mercy  
And limit the trespassers!  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
  
Through the pain and anguish  
Bring those who bear hate closer to Thy gentle creation  
Reach out ,o Lord, in Thy holy mercy,  
And catch this innocent young girl,  
The loveliest of Thy peoples  
She cried out in the long dark night of her soul  
And we who love her on this earth  
Can neither hear nor understand!  
Only you, o God!  
Only You can once again present to her  
The warmth of a joyous life,  
An innocent world,  
A sunshine of laughter,  
And the grace of Jesus Christ!  
Only You!  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you
