Walter Gretzky had a son  
He grew up to be the great one  
He came from Brantford Ontario  
He liked Gordie Howe you know  
Americans don't understand  
The national sport of the north land  
The world's fastest game they always dissin'  
But they don't know what they are missin'  
If they'd just watch Wayne Gretzky play  
Then they'd watch hockey everyday  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks  
  
When I lived in Edmonton  
He made us the City of Champions  
With Jari and Semenko by his side  
He filled our frigid city with pride  
Then he moved out to L. A.  
To help bring hockey to the you. S. A.  
Everyone hated Peter and Janet  
For trading the best player on the planet  
They traded him and sure enough  
He took the Kings to the Stanley Cup  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks  
  
He came from Brantford Ontario  
His rival's name is Mario  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks
