Now you say that you're leavin'  
Well it can't be too soon  
And you spend all of my money  
You knocked my guitar out of tune.  
  
Well you say you're sick and tired  
Tired of having me around  
And you call me cheatin' liar  
You drove my car into the ground.  
  
And I'll be glad when you're gone  
Yes I'll be glad when you're gone  
And when you walk out that door  
Darlin' please don't come back no more  
  
Now I wish I'd never known you  
And I wish we'd never met  
I was drunk you gave me whiskey  
When I was ill you called the vet.  
  
Well you say that it's over  
And you think you'll bring me down  
If you come back lookin' for me  
I'll be out there on the town.
