Down in the valley, ha  
In the valley so low,  
Hang your hair over your shoulder  
And you can hear the four winds blow, now, oh my  
  
Now can't you hear the wind blow my love,  
Can't you hear the wind blow,  
We're down in the valley, ha  
In the valley so low, now, ha  
  
Now have you ever been lonely, lonely, ha  
Now have you ever been sad  
Did you ever really need some one, oh my

Help me baby, gotta get the groove  
So too much, ooh yeah

In the valley so low  
It was when I held you so tight  
How can I ever let you go, go, go, go, ooh now  
  
Now it was down, down, down, down, down, down, down  
In the valley so low, ooh my  
When I held you so tight, now
