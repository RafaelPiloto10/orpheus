Remember Rio and get down  
Like some other DJ, in some other town  
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight  
But I've been waiting this whole night  
  
But I've been down across the road or two  
But now I've found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back, uh huh, I can't crack  
We're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
  
The day is breaking, we're still here  
Your body's shaking, and it's clear  
You really need it, so let go  
And let me feed it, but you know  
  
That I've been down across the road or two  
But now I've found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back, uh huh, I can't crack  
We're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
We bring the bump to the grind, uh huh  
I don't mind, we're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shack, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
  
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight  
  
It's like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because I'm fine  
  
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight  
  
It's like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because I'm fine
