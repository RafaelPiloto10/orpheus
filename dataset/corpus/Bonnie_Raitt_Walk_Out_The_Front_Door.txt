I can't, I can't make love to your memory  
I can't put my arms, around what used to be  
Everything I had, was apart of me  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
My friends tell me, it'll be alright  
But my friends never, no, never held you close at night  
Every dream I had, that could see the light  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
I never knew, I never thought that you'd take my love and tear it apart  
I gave you my best, when I gave you my heart  
Oh, are you listening? Or is this all in vain? yeah  
I still can't believe, you're never comin' back again  
  
Everything I had, oh, except my pain  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you, hey, yeah,  
Well you went and it walked, well you went and it walked,  
Right out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked right out  
Never comin' back no more  
Right out
