[Pre-Chorus]  
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance  
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen  
We both set out to sink, we were rocking in the waves  
And you prayed my boat was sinking, you lead me to the grave  
  
[Chorus]  
And now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands  
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands  
  
[Verse 1]  
The going almost feels like we're flying  
Cause the smoke's got you too know, it seems the matrix is all the above  
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands  
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance  
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen  
We both set out to sink, we were rocking in the waves  
And you prayed my boat was sinking, you lead me to the grave
