Say that again I won't forget  
The prase that turned in my head  
And at the start it makes no sense  
A long time left to understand  
There on the shore the girl that I adore  
She combs her hair on the sand  
  
And I know you got fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
Yeah I know you got be your own man  
You got to break the rules  
  
Say that again, the alphabet  
They dance a pihouette in my head  
A chance remark become the spark  
And maybe luck has come again  
The hint of a smile  
The accidental rhyme  
That captured me the first time  
  
I know you got to fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
I know you got to be your own man  
You've got to break the rules  
Midnite is standing in the shadows  
This haunting is a reckless escape  
Late nights of crawling on the sidewalk  
Lets stay on in the mansion for the weekend  
Lets go on making moments last a lifetime  
We live on in the promises we keep  
  
The hint of a smile  
The accidental rhyme  
That captured me the first time  
  
I know you got to fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
I know you got to be your own man  
You got to make your own rules  
  
Lets go on making moments last a lifetime  
We live on in the promises we keep
