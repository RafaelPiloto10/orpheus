[The defenders settle down for the night with wine and a song.]  
  
Enjolras  
Marius, rest.  
  
Feuilly  
Drink with me  
To days gone by  
Sing with me  
The songs we knew  
  
Prouvaire  
Here's to pretty girls  
Who went to our heads  
  
Joly  
Here's to witty girls  
Who went to our beds  
  
All  
Here's to them  
And here's to you!  
  
Grantaire  
Drink with me  
To days gone by  
Can it be  
You fear to die?  
Will the world remember you  
When you fall?  
Could it be your death  
Means nothing at all?  
Is your life just one more lie?  
  
Men  
Drink with me  
To days  
Gone by  
To the life  
That used  
To be  
Let the wine of friendship  
Never run dry Women  
Drink with me  
To days  
Gone by  
To the life  
That used  
To be  
At the shrine of friendship  
Never say die  
  
All  
Here's to you  
And here's  
To me...  
  
Marius  
Do I care if I should die  
Now she goes across the sea?  
Life without Cosette  
Means nothing at all  
Would you weep, Cosette,  
Should Marius fall?  
Will you weep,  
Cosette,  
For me?  
  
[Marius settles down to sleep.]
