Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair  
You certainly know the right thing to wear  
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight  
And I could get so romantic tonight  
  
You're all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now don't tell me I'm wrong  
And what a night to go dreaming  
Mind if I tag along  
  
If I say I love you  
I want you to know  
It's not just because there's moonlight  
Although, moonlight becomes you so  
  
You're all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now don't tell me I'm wrong  
And what a night to go dreaming  
Mind if I tag along  
  
If I say I love you  
I want you to know  
It's not just because there's moonlight  
Although, moonlight becomes you so
