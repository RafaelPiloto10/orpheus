Live it up, and let it go  
Your time is up before you know  
In a world full of wonder  
Don't let your troubles pull you under  
  
You're telling me your life is tough  
And what you need is stronger stuff  
Well you can live under sedation  
Or get up and cause an overnight sensation  
  
Whoa, live it up  
Life is what you make it  
Whoa, live it up  
It's right there for you to take it  
  
You sit and watch your MTV  
You dream away in a fantasy  
If you don't dig the situation  
Then get a guitar and rock the nation  
  
You can't hold back once you light the fuse  
And if it feels alright, then let it roll  
You got nothin' to lose  
  
Whoa, live it up  
Life is what you make it  
Whoa, live it up  
It's right there for you to take it
