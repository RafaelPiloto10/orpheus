(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
Ten planes falling from the sky,  
The setting sun leaves no trace,  
My name was written in the sky,  
But now there is no trace.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.  
Shadow faces reaching for me,  
Pretending they know what's best for me,  
But I know that I am their experiment,  
I scare myself with paranoid talk.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.  
I try to keep the whispered words at bay,  
For they seem to feed into the mire,  
I've lost all ability to make any choices,  
I'm teetering in purgatory.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.
