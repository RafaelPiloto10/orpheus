[Verse 1]  
For all the times I felt cheated, I complained  
You know how I love to complain  
For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame  
I still cursed that rain  
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue  
Then out of the blue  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
[Verse 2]  
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt  
All wrapped up in that hurt  
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty  
Now it overflows like a river through my soul  
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free  
And I truly believe  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
[Verse 3]  
In your arms I'm someone new  
With ever tender kiss from you  
Oh must confess  
I've been blessed  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)  
Now I do (I finally do), 'cause God gave me you (God gave me You)  
  
[Outro]  
God gave me you
