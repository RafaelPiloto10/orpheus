There's a sense of longing in me  
As I read Rosemary's letter  
Her writing's honest  
Can't forget the years she's lost  
  
In isolation  
She talks about her love  
And as I read  
"I'll die alone"  
I know she was aching  
  
There's a certain detail seen here  
The pen must have slipped to the side  
And left a stain  
Next to his name  
She knew he was gone  
  
And isolation  
Is all that would remain  
"The wound in me is pouring out  
To rest on a lover's shore"
