Wish I had just one more chance to hold you close and say I love you.  
Can't believe out romance was just beginning. Now its Through.  
I'm looking for tomorrow to start a newlife on my own.  
And all I see is sorrow. You're all I lived for. Now you're gone.  
I can't seem to get you off my mind no matter what I do.  
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes, but the tears keep fallin' through.  
The hardest thing that love has put me through is gettin' over you, gettin'  
Over you, over you, over you.
