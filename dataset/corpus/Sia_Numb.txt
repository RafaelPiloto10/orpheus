I saw you cry today  
The pain may fill you  
I saw you shy away  
The pain will not kill you  
  
You made me smile today  
You spoke with many voices  
We traveled miles today  
Shared expressions voiceless  
  
It has to end  
  
[Chorus]  
Living in your head  
Without anything to numb you  
Living on the edge  
Without anything to numb you  
  
It has to end to begin  
  
Began and end today  
Gave and got given  
You made a friend today  
Kindred soul cracked spirit  
  
It has to end to begin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It had to end to begin  
  
[Chorus: x2]
