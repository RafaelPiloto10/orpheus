I feel so close to you  
'Cause you know you always do  
Help me down that road  
  
I go to sleep at night  
Feeling that it's alright  
'Cause you help me down that road  
  
When I feel I've been beat  
You get me on my feet  
You help me spread that heavy load  
  
Now that I realize  
Just where our friendship lies  
It will help me down that road  
  
You think you've seen my best  
But you ain't seen nothin' yet  
Since you, help me down that road  
  
When life is a bitter sweet  
You mix it up a treat  
Yeah, you're the best pick up I know  
  
If you don't satisfy  
Don't give me the evil eye  
It won't help me down that road  
  
When I ain't doin' so well  
You never kiss and tell  
You just help me down that road  
  
Just when I'm feelin' sick  
You give my heart a kick  
Then I don't feel so all alone  
  
When I can't get it right  
Just when the end's in sight  
Yes you help me down that road  
  
I know you'll be callin' me  
To see you that I'm OK  
I know that you will always be  
With me night and day  
  
I could live in poverty, I could be in pain  
I know that you'd be there with me  
To you it's all the same
