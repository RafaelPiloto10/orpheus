I want to talk to folks back home again, to walk along a lonely country lane  
To spend some time with that woman of mine, heading south, heading south  
Things look bright and I feel alright yeah I'm heading south  
Heading south to see the sun go down on camp fire light,to join the singing at
night  
Heading south to cotton rows and honeysuckle bloom  
Under the cumberland moon heading south, heading south  
Give me room to travel on my way to a place where dreams all fade away  
Where the river flows and tobacco grows heading south heading south  
Cause the sun is hot and people love a lot yeah I'm heading south  
Heading south to see the sun go down on camp fire light, to join the singing
at night  
Heading south to cotton rows and honeysuckle bloom under the cumberland moon  
Heading south, heading south
