Whisper 'round the town,  
Cause you're my friend and that's the end  
For you're the only one in town  
Who they will beg to hang around with  
You're so beautiful and calm  
But with an attitude that says:  
"Hands-off, you're just not good enough"  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Can't understand why you'd be with me  
Furthermore, we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday, so they say:  
  
(Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
  
Well, that says maybe, in a way, but it's okay  
We are touching, while they stare in front of us  
They draw away, as if to say:  
"Who are these people anyway?  
How dare they confront us?"  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Can't understand why you'd be with me  
Furthermore, we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday, so they say:  
  
(Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
  
Oh no, no no  
Oh no, no no  
(Girlfriend Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend, oh, oh, oh Girlfriend)  
  
I'd rather die, than satisfy their curiosity  
I'm kind of shy and dry, and verging on ugly  
They wonder what that I have got, that they have not  
They'll never understand that none of that matters  
  
Every boy and man feeling lonely  
Can't understand why you'd be with me  
Furthermore, we laugh and we draw  
More attention everyday, so they say:  
  
(Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend Oh oh oh Girlfriend  
Oh oh oh Girlfriend)  
Bet she's not your, bet she's not your,  
Bet she's not your,bet she's not your,  
(Oh oh oh Girlfriend)  
Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no  
  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend  
(Oh, oh, oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy  
  
Bet she's not your girlfriend
