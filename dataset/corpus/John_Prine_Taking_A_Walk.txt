A man came to our house  
I believe it was yesterday  
I would have invited him in  
But I didn't have a lot to say  
His anticipation of me opening the door  
Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before  
And drove my concentration  
Right through that hardwood floor  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm taking a walk  
I'm going outside  
I'm taking a walk  
I'm just gettin' back  
  
There's a girl in the white house  
I don't even know her name  
Her disheveled appearance  
Speaks volumes of shame  
It's an embarrassing situation  
But a situation just the same  
The way she walks on others  
And never takes the blame  
Upsets my constitution  
Beyond its motor frame  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Found a carton departed  
Of my worn out overalls  
From a girl in Cedar Rapids  
Now residing in Idaho Falls  
I wish you could've been there  
When she opened up the door  
And looked me in the face  
Like she never did before  
I felt about as welcome  
As a Wal-Mart superstore  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
I'm taking walk (Taking a walk)  
I'm going outside (Going outside)  
I'm taking a walk (Taking a walk)  
I don't need a ride (Just getting by)  
I'm watching the birds (Taking a walk)  
Flying so high (Going outside....)
