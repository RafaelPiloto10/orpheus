Each passing night  
I try and close my eyes  
But thoughts of you  
They wake me up  
And tear me inside out  
Each passing night  
I ask myself who's right  
And try to find the reasons why  
It had to end that night  
Didn't we share each other's dreams  
We held each other tight  
Ang tears fell fromm my eyes  
As you walked and left me here  
Like the wind you passed me by  
I try but I can't see  
If it's something that I said  
Baby please won't you tell me now  
'Cause it gets harder each passing night  
I often pray  
That you'd come back and stay  
We've had too much together  
To ever live a part  
I'll wait and see  
'Cause I know and I believe  
Someday you'll come to realize  
What you and I can be  
Then we'll share each other's dreams  
We'll held each other tight  
Kiss the tears that burn my eyes  
'Cause you walked and left me here  
Like the wind you passed me by  
I try but I can't see  
If it's something that I said  
Baby, please won't you tell me now  
'Cause it gets harder each passing night  
I never meant to hurt your heart this way  
Sooner or later  
There'd be someone else who'd stay  
Didn't we share each other's dreams  
(share each other's dreams)  
You tear me inside out  
(and tears fell from my eyes)  
Someday you'd realize  
(as you walked and left me here)  
Like the wind you passed me by  
(I try but I can't see)  
Kiss the tears that burn my eyes  
(Baby please won't you tell me now)  
'Cause it gets harder each passing night  
(I try but I can't see)  
I try but I can't s
