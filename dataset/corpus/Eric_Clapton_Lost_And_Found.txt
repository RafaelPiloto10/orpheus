Falling in the deep end  
Stop messin' around  
I cant keep from falling  
When you're not around  
I cant no rest when you leave  
Your love keeps me burnin'  
You got me lost and found  
And my world keeps turnin'  
  
It's not the same  
When you're gone  
Feel like I'm  
Half of myself  
Cause I need to have you around  
  
I need to hear that sound  
Of you creepin in the mornin'  
I need to look in your eyes  
When it keeps me learnin'  
  
It's not the same  
When your gone  
Feel like I'm  
Half of myself  
Cause I can't keep my feet on the ground  
You keep me lost and found  
And girl it feels good  
  
So, I want you to know  
I'm ready to let it show  
That I'll be around  
  
It's not the same  
When you're gone  
Feel like I'm  
Half of myself  
It's not the same  
When you're gone  
Feel like I'm  
Half of a man  
But, I can't keep my feet on the ground  
You got me lost and found  
And, girl, it feels good  
  
So, I want you to know  
I'm ready to let it show  
That I'll be around  
  
Can't keep my feet on the ground  
You got me lost and found  
And girl it feels good  
  
So, I want you to know  
I'm ready to let it show  
That I'll be around
