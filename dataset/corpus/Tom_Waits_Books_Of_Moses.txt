Books of Moses, bringing stone news  
Wet in the water, weeping in the sun  
Books of Moses, got some splinters didn't you  
Books of Moses, brought me right here back to you  
  
Flaming heart, ain't it sweet  
Lighting the world at your feet  
Books of Moses, myth and truth  
Books of Moses, bring me back to you  
  
Hero's welcome, there stands your king  
Where the serpent shudders and the angels sing  
Books of Moses, happening again  
Yes he knows us  
Well welcome him, your friend  
  
Books of Moses, bringing stone news  
Wet is the water, blood covering the sun  
Books of Moses, myth and truth  
Books of Moses, bring me back to you
