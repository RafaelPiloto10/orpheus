You're so impossible  
Scream and moan it chills my soul  
Don't want to hear you got left behind  
All those times you stayed up and cried  
It's no lie  
You did it to yourself  
Like chewed up gum under my shelf  
Don't look surprised  
You must have know all along  
  
It's just another love song  
Another love song  
  
It's never easy  
It's not hard  
When you've lost your mind  
With you it's sleezy  
Don't tell me your worries  
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind  
Now the time has come  
To leave this love that's left you dry  
No need to work this out now  
Cause you know there's no reason why  
  
It's just another love song  
Another love song  
  
I never told you it would last forever  
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it  
By the time you read my letter  
Baby, I'll be gone  
  
You're just another love song  
Another love song
