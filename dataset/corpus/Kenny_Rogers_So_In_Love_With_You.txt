Girl, I've seen you lonesome every morning,  
By my side you?d never be alone,  
Just tell me what it is your heart desire,  
'Cause all I wanna do is take you home.  
  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
Yes, I'm so in love with you  
Yes, I'm so in love with you  
I'm so in love with you.  
  
Come on girl, I need you here beside me,  
I'll show you love like you've never known  
And I will tell the world how much I love you,  
'Cause all I wanna do is take you home.  
  
'Cause I'm so in love...  
  
See, is it only just a minute  
Your love I've got to win it  
Don't let me down  
You know there's one thing about you,  
I just can't live without you  
Don't let me down.  
  
You're the one that keeps all together,  
Let me hold you in my arms all through the night  
What I'm trying to say it's girl I love you  
And loving you is the best part of my life.  
  
'Cause I'm so ...
