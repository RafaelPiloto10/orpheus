Oh hell trouble is coming  
Out here in panic and alarm  
Black shapes gather in the distance  
Looks like it won't take long  
The first drops land on the window  
The first sign that there's something wrong  
Light rain and a head full of thunder  
Which way, which way  
Two days till I get to you  
I'll be late if I ever get through  
Where I go there'll be no kind welcome  
Coming down upon me  
Time will keep me warm  
Feel my face  
Now the insects swarm  
In the lowlands  
Fear will take the place of desire  
And we will fan the flames from on high  
Try for heavens sake  
The sky fell underneath a blanket  
The sun sank as the miles went by  
Sit back with your head on the pillow  
When you remember it makes you cry  
Ghost cars on the freeway  
Like friends that you thought you had  
One by one they are disappearing  
Time will keep me warm  
Feel my face  
Now the insects swarm  
In the lowlands  
Fear will take the place of desire  
And we will fan the flames from on high
