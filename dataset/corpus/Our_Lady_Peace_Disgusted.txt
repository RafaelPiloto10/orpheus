I've never seen your breath before  
But I'm disgusted by the thought of  
Waiting any more  
And if I look up in your eyes  
Will you open up a little more  
I know you know it's all gone wrong  
And I don't wanna find  
Pain and sleep in front of your mind  
But I don't wanna find  
That mostly you and mostly me  
And all we need is a little bit here  
I never been inside before  
But I'm offended by the thought of being  
What you know  
And as I look into your mind  
Will you open up a little bit more  
And all you know is wrong  
And I don't wanna find  
The pain and struggle in your eyes  
But I don't wanna find  
With mostly you with mostly me and all  
We need is a little bit here  
I never seen your breath before  
But I'm disgusted by the thought of  
Waiting any more  
And if I look into your eyes  
Will you open up a little bit more  
And all you know is wrong  
And I don't wanna find  
The pain and struggle in your eyes (mind?)  
And I don't wanna find  
That mostly you and mostly me  
And all we need is a little bit here  
And I don't wanna find  
The pain and struggle in your eyes  
And I don't wanna find  
When I wont believe is helping you and  
All and All it's all gone wrong
