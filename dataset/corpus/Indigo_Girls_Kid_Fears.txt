Pain from pearls, hey little girl,  
How much have you grown?  
Pain from pearls, hey little girl,  
Flower for the ones you've known.  
  
Are you on fire,  
From the years?  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears?  
  
Secret staircase, running high,  
You had a hiding place.  
Secret staircase, running low,  
But they all know, now you're inside.  
  
Are you on fire,  
From the years?  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears?  
  
Skipping stones, we know the price now  
Any sin will do  
How much further, if you can spin.  
How much further, if you are smooth.  
  
Are you on fire,  
From the years?  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears?  
  
Replace the rent with the stars above  
Replace the need with love.  
  
Replace the anger with the tide.  
Replace the ones, the ones, the ones, that you love.  
  
Are you on fire,  
From the years?  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears?
