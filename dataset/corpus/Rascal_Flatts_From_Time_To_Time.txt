From time to time I have regrets  
For all the things I didn't say  
That were on my list  
From time to time my memory slips  
But you're the one thing in my life  
I won't forget  
  
There'll never be minute of the day  
I won't think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
There'll never be a night that's so dark that we won't shine  
Or a dream that we've lost that we can't find  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
There'll never be minute of the day  
I won't think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
There'll never be a night that's so dark that we won't shine  
Or a dream that we've lost that we can't find  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
Oooo, yeah  
  
You'll always be, Oooo the one for me  
From time to time  
And in between yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah I do  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between, yeah
