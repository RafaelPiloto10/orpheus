It's a peaceful thing to know that freedom as a rule belongs to me  
There's something very wrong when the color of a man is all you see  
After all this time how can a single voice explain  
Any reason for the pain we all have seen  
It's not a dream  
  
[Chorus]  
One man stood tall  
And faced the devil with his back to the wall  
And took one step closer to heaven above  
  
So he took a stand and walked where no one else would dare to even try  
It was the only way  
If not for bravery, the soul would surely die  
And right before my eyes he gave his life unselfishly  
So that all the father's children could be free  
Like you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before his work is done  
We've got to put an end to this game of choosing sides  
I want us to be one  
And I won't let it go 'till it's over  
I'm here waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm waiting, waiting
