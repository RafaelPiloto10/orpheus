She fell out of bed and said, I'm leavin' this place  
In a hot blooded, red-headed rage  
She grabbed her things and slammed out that door  
Jumped in the car, said, don't need you no more  
  
She turned on the radio I said, hey, hey babe  
Why do you have to treat me this way  
She's wrapped up and wound herself way too tight  
I think she's finally come loose this time  
  
She's not the same, I can't explain  
She's gone away, I don't mean maybe  
She's not the same, my burnin' flame  
She's gone  
She's gone crazy  
  
She's drivin' me crazy  
  
Well I rode down the highway, so she pulled off  
Way past the point of gettin' lost  
She calls me up on my mobile phone  
I said, hey, hey babe  
You're in the twilight zone  
  
Call it blind luck but she found a way  
Back to the scene where it all took place  
And when she walked through that door it's all I could say  
Hey, hey babe it's me that's changed  
  
She's not the same, I can't explain  
She's gone away, I don't mean maybe  
She's not the same, my burnin' flame  
She's gone  
She's gone crazy  
  
Come on, get out of here  
You're drivin' me crazy  
  
I'm not the same, I can't explain  
I'm goin' away, I don't mean maybe  
I'm not the same  
It's me that's changed  
She's gone  
She's gone crazy  
  
She's gone away, no time to play  
She's in the wings  
No time to please  
Come on, get out of here  
She's drivin' me crazy  
  
Go on, get out  
Good-bye  
Good-bye  
Good-bye  
Good-bye  
Good-bye
