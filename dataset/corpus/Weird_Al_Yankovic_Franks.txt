Risin' above the city, blocking out the noonday sun  
It dwarfs the mighty redwoods and it towers over everyone  
I still remember when that delivery truck came down our block  
What a lucky guy, I hear he got the last one in stock  
And the neighbors are just green  
They say, "That's the biggest screen we've ever seen!"  
  
It's Frank's 2000" T-V (Frank's 2000" T-V)  
Everybody come and see(Frank's 2000" T-V)  
Frank's 2000" T-V (Frank's 2000" T-V)  
  
That's Frank's remote control, you can look, but don't touch it, please  
'Cause Frank's the one in charge and he decides what everybody sees  
The picture's crystal clear and everything is magnified  
Robert DeNiro's mole has got to be ten feet wide  
Everybody in the town  
Can hear those 90,000 watts of Dolby sound  
And I'm mighty proud to say  
Now I can watch "The Simpsons" from thirty blocks away  
  
On Frank's 2000" T-V (Frank's 2000" T-V)  
Everybody come and see (Frank's 2000" T-V)

Everybody come and see (Frank's 2000" T-V)  
  
I'm gonna get one of my own real soon  
It's like having a drive-in movie in your own living room  
Whoa, hey now, hey now na na na now  
Hey now, hey now na na now
