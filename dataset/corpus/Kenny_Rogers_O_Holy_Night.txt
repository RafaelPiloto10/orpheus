Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh ni-ight divi-ine, oh-oh ni-ight when Christ was born  
Oh night divi-ine, oh-oh night, oh-oh night divine  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
With all of them must praise His holy name  
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we  
His power and glory-why, ever more proclaim  
His power and glor-or-ory-why, ever more-ore-ore proclaim...  
  
Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh...  
Oh-oh..., oh-oh... [fade]
