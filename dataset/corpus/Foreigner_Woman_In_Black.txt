I knew the moment  
I walked through that door  
I felt so close to a burning sensation  
It got so warm  
As I moved across the floor  
My body aching with anticipation  
I saw a dark silhouette, at the table  
I tried to talk, but I was unable  
She drew me in right under her spell  
I was hypnotized by the sudden temptation  
Of that woman in black, she's a mystery  
She's everything a woman should be  
Woman in black, she's got a hold on me  
She's in control, she won't set me free  
She is a woman  
She's not a girl anymore  
The kind that stirs up a young man's imagination  
She's dressed to kill  
And I'm so ready to fall  
Into her world full of strange fascination  
I see that dark silhouette, at the table  
I can't resist, my body's not able  
She draws me in, but she teaches me well  
I never need any explanation  
From that woman in black, she's a mystery  
She's everything a woman should be  
I said, woman in black, got a hold on me  
She's in control, she won't set me free  
Ooh, woman in black  
It's too late now  
I can't turn back  
'cause I'm a fool for that woman  
Woman in black  
Ooh, ooh, woman in black  
Ooh, that woman in black, she's a mystery  
She's everything a woman should be  
That woman in black, she's got a hold on me  
She's in control, she won't set me free  
She's my mysterious mistress  
But she leaves me so helpless  
My woman in black  
She's a dark senorita  
My woman in black  
No Sunday school teacher  
My woman in black  
We're keeping it a secret  
We meet in the night  
We're partners in silence  
Strangers in daylight
