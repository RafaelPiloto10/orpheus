Fight, fight, fight  
Fighting the World every single day  
Fighting the World for the right to play  
Heavy Metal in my brain  
I'm fighting for Metal cause it's here to stay  
  
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World  
I been fighting the World  
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World  
I been figthing  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight  
  
Now people keep asking if we're going to change  
I look'em in the eye  
Tell'em no way  
Strips on a tiger don't wash away  
Manowar's made of steel not clay  
  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing the World  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing  
  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight Yeah!  
See my brother standing by my side  
Only got one thing in our mind  
Radio playing this nation wide  
Turn it up louder'til we all get fried  
  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing the World  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing  
Fight-Fighting the World  
Fight-Fighting the World  
Fight-Fighting the World  
Fight-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
