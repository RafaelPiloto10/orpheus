I slipped into my jeans  
Lookin' hard and feelin' mean  
I took a spit at the moon  
It's all in this luney tune  
Just a little insane  
A couple shots, I can't feel no pain  
Hey, where have I been?  
And who are these scary men?  
  
Is this all real?  
Is this all necessary?  
Or it this a joke?  
  
Many know, I don't regret at all  
They locked me up for good  
Pinned me against the wall  
  
I can't find the exit  
I quit looking for doors  
I stole a razor from the commissary  
I just couldn't take it no more  
  
I'm swimmin' in blood  
Like a rat on a sewer floor  
No longer insane  
Just part of this crazy dream
