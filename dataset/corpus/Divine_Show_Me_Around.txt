I just got into this town  
But it already seems such a bore  
Not what you call a small town  
But I've seen a hundred like it before.  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperature's up, my energy's high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight.  
  
Chorus  
Show me around, I'm looking for a lover  
Show me around, I've seen it all before  
Show me around, I'm searching for a brother  
Going over the top and I sure as hell ain't going alone  
  
I'm not staying forever  
Just long enough to see a little more  
I might be new to this place  
But I ain't new to the score  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
Thought I ain't one for acting coy  
I'm gonna dress up  
I'm gonna show you tonight  
That I ain't no country boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperature's up, my energy's high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight
