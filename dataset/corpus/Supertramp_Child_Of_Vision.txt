Well, who do you think you're foolin'?  
You say you're havin' fun,  
But you're busy going nowhere,  
Just lying in the sun.  
You tried to be a hero,  
Commit the perfect crime  
But the dollar got you dancing  
And you're running out of time.  
You're messin' up the water  
You're rolling in the wine  
You're poisoning your body  
You're poisoning your mind  
You gave me coca-cola  
You said it tasted good  
You watch the television  
If it tell you that you should.  
  
How can you live in this way?  
(Why do you think it's so strange?)  
You must have something to say.  
(Tell me why should I change?)  
There must me more to this life  
It's finally we did something right  
Child of Vision, won't you listen?  
Find yourself a new ambition.  
  
I've heard it all before  
You're saying nothing new  
I thought I saw a rainbow  
But I guess it wasn't true  
You cannot make me listen  
And you cannot make you hear  
You find your way to heaven,  
I'll meet you when you're there.  
  
How can you live in this way?  
(Why do you think it's so strange?)  
You must have something to say.  
(Tell me why should I change?)  
We have no reason to fight,  
'Cause we both know that we're right. Because  
Child of vision, won't you listen?  
Find yourself a new ambition.
