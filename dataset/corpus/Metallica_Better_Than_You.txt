I look at you then you me  
Hungry and thirsty I wait  
Holding the lion's share  
Holding the key  
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be  
Better than you (better than you)  
Better than you (better than you)  
Lock homes I push and I strive  
Somehow I feel more alive  
Bury the deep forest  
Bury the sea  
Bury me deep when there's no will to be  
Better than you (better than you)  
Oh better than you (better than you)  
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling  
Oh, yo, nothing brings me down  
No, can't stop this train from rolling on and on, on  
No, no, forever on and on  
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling  
Oh, yo, you can't take it down  
No, never stop this locomotion on and on and on  
No, no, you can't bring me down 'cause I'm  
Better than you (better than you)  
Better than you (better than you)  
Oh better than you (better than you)  
Better than you (better than you)  
Much better than you  
Better than you (better than you)  
Oh better than you (better than you)  
Better than you (better than you)  
Better than  
Better than  
Better than  
Better than you  
Yeah  
Can't stop this train from rolling  
Forever on and on and on and on and on  
Forever on and on and on  
Better than you  
Yeah  
Haha  
Better than you
