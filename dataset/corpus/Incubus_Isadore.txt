Erica and her Isadore  
Climbed aboard a balloon  
I want more than this kite will soar  
I've set our sights on the moon  
  
You can't just leave, I've given everything  
I can't believe you're taking everything  
You're taking everything  
Oh  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Blinded by their unbridled height  
Our lovers turned dissolute  
  
You can't just leave, I've given everything  
I can't believe you're taking everything  
You're taking everything  
Oh  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Then with eyes wide, a splintered sight  
There's just one parachute  
Goodbye Erica now I see  
That my worst fears were in tune  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Knows the name Isadore  
Won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore
