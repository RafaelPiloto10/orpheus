How do you feel?  
Now they've swapped that good old carthorse for a car?  
How do you feel?  
Now he's handed in his sword and taken a dart?  
Are your tiny hands starting to warm?  
Does your battered heart feel less torn?  
  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle, she shows bleeding knees  
As long as he agrees  
  
How do you feel?  
Now they've swapped your concrete cell for a padded one?  
How do you feel?  
Now every single dream you had is gone?  
Does this decay bring you to life?  
Well, I think it probably might  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle, she shows bleeding knees  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
The blood pours from her knees  
  
You and your big ideas again  
Tell me how do you feel?
