Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
  
Sugar and spice  
Righter than right  
Never had a feeling so nice, no, girl  
I want to tell the world  
I found me a girl  
  
Sweeter than sweet  
That's how I feel  
Never had a feeling so real, no, girl  
I want to tell the world  
I found me a girl  
  
I told my baby that I had to get away  
And that I'd be back another day  
She didn't even ask me where I had to go  
She said she didn't need to know, ooh, ooh  
  
Just said she'd miss me every minute of the time  
She wrote me that on a valentine  
That's how I know that I can't stay away too long  
'Cause I'm gonna get myself back home to my  
  
Sugar and spice (We've got a)  
Righter than right (Love affair), said yeah, yeah

That's how I feel (Every day), say hey, hey, hey  
Never had a feeling so real, no, girl  
I want to tell the world  
I found me a girl  
  
I can't think of anything that I would ever miss  
More than her sweet and tender kiss  
She's got something that I just can't seem to resist  
And that's why I've got to tell you this, listen here  
  
I've heard some talk there's gonna be a hurricane  
Big heavy winds and lots of rain, it's gonna carry on  
And that's why I'm hopin' that it's not gon' take too long  
'Cause I'm gonna ride that wind back to my  
  
Sugar and spice (We've got a)  
Righter than right (Love affair), I say yeah, yeah  
Never had a feeling so nice, no, girl  
I want to tell the world  
I found me a girl  
  
Sweeter than sweet (Oh, sugar)  
That's how I feel (Every day), I said hey, hey, hey  
Never had a feeling so real, no, girl  
I want to tell the world  
I found me a girl  
  
I never knew I could feel like I do  
I'm in Heaven, you see  
If you need me you know where I'm gonna be  
Look out  
  
And everyday I thank my lucky stars  
And all Heaven above  
I'm at last and forever in love  
She's my girl  
  
She's mine all mine  
(Gotta tell the world I found a girl)  
I gotta take my time  
(I found a girl)  
  
And let everybody know  
(Gotta tell the world I found a girl)  
I mean tell the world

Sweeter than sweet (Ooh, sugar)  
That's how I feel (Every day), I said hey, hey, hey  
Never had a feeling so real
