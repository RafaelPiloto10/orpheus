I've got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've gotta the follow money  
Gotta earn my pay  
I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash  
Cause it won't find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
  
When I left school I was bummin' around  
I'd smoke and drink and let my mind wander  
I'd roll out of bed about twelve o'clock  
I can't do that any longer  
  
I've gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Now I need to toil 'cause it's good for my soul  
I feel clean when I'm working  
You drop all the mystical Celtic bull  
Cause that stuff's just jerking  
  
I'm not saying that I work like my dad  
I know I don't work like my mum  
But I'm made of the same stuff  
And I'm six feet tall  
Gimme the tools I'll get the job done  
  
Gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bit my lip  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
I've gotta follow the money  
Gotta earn my pay  
I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash  
Cause it won't find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
Feed myself and my family  
That's why  
  
I'm working  
I'm working  
I'm working  
I'm working  
I'm working  
I'm working now
