True Reflections  
When you look into a mirror  
Do you like what's looking at you  
Now that you've seen your true reflections  
What on earth are you gonna do  
  
Find some inspiration  
It's down deep inside of you  
Amend your situation  
Your whole life is ahead of you  
Your whole life is ahead of you  
  
Remember the time you hung out with the boys now  
Remember the things you used to say  
I thought by now you'd be the president  
But after all that was yesterday  
You've had time to go out in the world now  
But you chose to run away  
People ask you what your doin' now  
You don't even know what to say  
  
You think life is like a movie  
Where it all works out in the end  
I think life is like a desert  
Where does it go where does it begin  
When you look into a mirror  
Do you like what's looking at you  
Now that you've seen your true reflections  
What on earth are you gonna do  
  
Find some inspiration  
It's down deep inside of you
