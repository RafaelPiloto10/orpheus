We are walking  
We move mountains  
We want you to want us  
But what can we do  
  
She sits alone as she sews  
Pierce the grey valiant  
I search for zero  
Here lies what she wore  
Guess I never had enough  
Out with the blue book  
Yes that I make up our minds  
  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more  
  
We are walking  
We move mountains  
We want you to want us  
But what can we do  
  
They sit in darkness as they sew  
He who breaks the rules and there you are  
Such a dark evening  
Maker of what it ain't and is  
May I ask no other guests  
They are in belief that I lost their faith  
The day that I arrived  
Make up our minds  
  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more  
Now Sue, now Sue, now Sue, now Sue, Sue ...
