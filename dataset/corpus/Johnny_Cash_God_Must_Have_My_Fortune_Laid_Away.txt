(God has my fortune laid away)  
Oh the world is full of people with money just to burn  
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn  
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day  
God has my fortune laid away  
  
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain  
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame  
Pockets that stay empty dreams that go astray  
God has my fortune laid away  
  
(God has my fortune laid away laid away)  
Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be  
Some people live in riches while some live just like me  
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay  
But God has my fortune laid away (laid away)  
I search for sunshine
