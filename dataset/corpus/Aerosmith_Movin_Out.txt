We all live on the edge of town  
Where we all live ain't a soul around  
People start a-comin'  
All we do is just a-grin  
Said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
I said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
  
Tell me who you know  
And I'll tell you who, too  
Go see my friend and he'll set you free  
Tell me what you see and  
Maybe I can go too  
No one knows the way but maybe me  
  
Nobody goes there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah  
  
Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to you  
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya  
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land  
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band  
  
Movin', we're gettin' out  
Movin', without a doubt  
Movin', we're goin' far  
We're movin', oh yes we are  
  
Nobody goes there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me, ah  
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy...  
  
Level with God  
And you're in tune with the universe  
Talk with yourself  
And you'll hear what you wanna know  
Gotta rise above  
'Cause below it's only gettin' worse  
Life in time  
Will take you where you wanna go  
  
Where you wanna go, where you wanna go  
Where you goin'...  
  
Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to you  
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya  
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land  
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band  
  
Movin', we're gettin' out  
Movin', yeah, without a doubt  
Movin', we're goin' far  
We're movin', oh yes we are  
  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can't find me  
Round n' round...  
  
We all live on the edge of town  
Where we all live ain't a soul around  
People start a-comin'  
All we do is just a-grin  
We gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
I said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
  
Yes we do...
