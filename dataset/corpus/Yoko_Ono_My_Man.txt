My man is the best in the world,  
He's got the sun in his heart and the moon in his soul.  
His head's in the clouds, but his feet on the ground,  
And when he speaks, all the birds come around.  
I love you, I love you.  
  
My man is the best in the world,  
His eyes got the shine of the ancient stars,  
His heartbeat is the beat of the ocean,  
He smells like an Aztec magic potion.  
I love you, I love you.  
  
Ah, ah, ah,  
  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, I love you, I love you.  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, I love you, I love you.  
  
My man is the best in the world,  
He knows me like the palm of his hand.  
When I'm good, he's so very good  
And when I'm bad, he laughs and says, don't be sad.  
I love you, I love you.  
  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
(I love you, I love you, I love you)  
  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
(I love you, I love you, I love you)  
  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
(I love you, I love you, I love you)  
  
Babalu-babalu-babalu, (babalu) I love you, I love you.  
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
