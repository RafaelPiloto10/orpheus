Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
When I'm talkin' to you  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
  
I'm about to!  
Wasn't that fun?  
Lets try something else, else, else, else  
  
Point 45 caliber killer out of the filla  
Elevated show your brothas how your not a gorilla  
Smooth talking fully automatic weapon constiller  
Taste thrilla, great filler  
Hit him like a Godzilla  
Filthy stinking standing on the side of the ground  
Still be sinking submerging in the parks  
Still be linking plucked beats when it starts  
Hope your thinking it's not a mirage  
I'm in a mother fucking tractor without a disguise  
Well if you could duck but it's hard to dodge  
In the back of that spine where my darkness lies  
Flippin straight up ripping apart your side  
X-Ecutioner's style cuts and blends  
Like a syringe banging you in each of your limbs  
See me coming through your party hard  
Without no body guard  
Smoking something, stomping on each of your tims  
I'm a B to the L to A to C king  
And when it comes around I hear the key thing it's  
  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!
