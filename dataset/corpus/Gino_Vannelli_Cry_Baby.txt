Cry baby shed a thousand tears  
Cry baby 'til all the dry land disappears  
You can sugar-coat the truth  
With all sweetness and light  
You can beg me for mercy  
But pardon my spite  
Cry it's your turn tonight  
Cry baby for all the good times we had  
Cry baby no the good don't outshine the bad  
You can grease me with kisses  
'til your red lips turn blue  
Offer me affection  
But what good would it do  
Cry like I cried for you  
I'm tired of making love together  
When you're apt to forget my given name  
It's over it's finished and what's better  
I am completely without pain  
Cry baby like a cloudburst in the sky  
Cry baby in other words goodbye  
You can try to move a mountain  
Attempt to calm the sea  
You'd sooner raise a dead man  
Than my deep sympathy  
Cry it don't matter to me  
It's over it's finished and what's better  
I am completely without pain  
Cry baby oooh  
Cry baby in other words goodbye  
You can try to move a mountain  
Attempt to calm the sea  
You'd sooner raise a dead man  
Than my deep sympathy  
Cry it just don't matter to me  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry baby cry baby  
Cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry cry cry cry cry
