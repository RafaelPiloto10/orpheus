Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and loved  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Sheppard's quake at the sight  
Glories stream from Heaven afar  
Heavenly ghosts sing Alleluia  
Christ the savor is born  
Christ the savor is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy night  
Son of God  
Loves pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Silent Night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and loved  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace
