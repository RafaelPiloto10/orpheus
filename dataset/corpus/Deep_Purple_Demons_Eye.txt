I don't mind just what you say.  
I never heard you, baby, never heard you anyway.  
I don't care what you do  
just so long as it ain't me and you.  
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye.  
  
Everything's good, I said, everything's fine.  
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time.  
How does it feel to be turned away?  
I've known it, baby, almost every day.  
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye.  
  
I don't need you anymore,  
I don't want you, baby, hanging round my door.  
You slip and slide round my brain.  
You think you're so clever, yeah, but you know you're insane.  
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye.  
  
I d-d-don't mind just what you say.  
I never heard you, baby, I never heard you anyway, no I didn't.  
Everything's good, everything's fine.  
You don't know it's the end of your time.  
Sly, sly, sly like the demon's eye,  
like the demon's eye.
