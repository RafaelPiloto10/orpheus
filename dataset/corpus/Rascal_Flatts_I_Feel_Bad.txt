I should be out in that driveway stopping you  
Tears should me rolling down my cheek  
And I don't know why I'm not falling apart like I usually do  
And how the thought of losing you is not killin' me  
I feel bad...  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I can't explain it  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bad  
  
I could let myself be angry over wasted time  
Sad about just throwing love away  
Yeah, I almost wish my heart was breakin'  
But I can't lie  
All I want to do is turn the page  
I feel bad...  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I can't explain it  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bitter, alone  
(It's time to...) I just feel it's time  
It's time to move on  
I just got to move on, and on, and on, and on  
  
Yeah  
  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Oh baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bad  
No, I don't feel bad
