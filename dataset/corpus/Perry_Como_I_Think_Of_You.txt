When I'm alone at night,  
And there's no one to comfort me,  
I think of you  
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms.  
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me,  
I think of you  
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket  
Soft and warm.  
  
How did I get from dark to daylight,  
Before you happened to pass by?  
How did I find my way through life,  
Before you brightened up my sky?  
Was there a sky at all,  
Until you painted it for me?  
How did I get on,  
'Till you came along?  
  
Who knows how many times I pause in every day,  
To think of you?  
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea!  
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you,  
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you,  
As you've become to me!  
I think of you  
I think of you
