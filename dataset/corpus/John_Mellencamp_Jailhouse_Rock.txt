The warden threw a party in the county jail.  
The prison band was there and they began to wail.  
The band was jumpin' down they began to swing.  
You should've heard those jailbirds sing.  
  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well Spider Murphy played on the saxophone,  
  
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.  
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,  
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well number forty-seven said to number three:  
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.  
I sure could enjoy some of your company,  
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."  
  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone  
  
When over in the corner weepin' all alone.  
The warden said, "buddy, don't you be no square.  
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,  
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."  
  
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix,  
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.
