Yes I need you darling, to tell my troubles to  
I know you'll understand me, when I'm feelin' blue  
Just give me an opportunity, give me an opportunity  
Give me an opportunity to prove my love is true  
Honey, I was a stranger till you found me  
The way you got me crying over you  
Baby, you kiss me and you hug me  
If you'd only say you love me, like I love you  
Give me an opportunity, give me an opportunity  
Give me an opportunity to prove my love is true, true  
  
Yes I need you darling, I swear by heaven above  
I need you here beside me, it's you I'm dreaming of  
Just give me an opportunity, give me an opportunity  
Give me an opportunity, give me an opportunity
