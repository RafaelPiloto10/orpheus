Feel me like I feel you  
Won't you let me come inside  
Heal me like I heal you  
Let your mind, body, soul, come alive  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey Hey I'm Alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new day  
And I feel fine  
  
Here to say I'm alive  
Want me like I want you  
That's my heart you hold in your hands  
Touch me like I touch you  
Make me feel like superman  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new  
And I feel fine  
  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Like the wind run with me  
Take my hand come with me  
Those bastards ain't bringing us down  
For all the dreams that died  
And all of the tears they cried  
If there's one thing I've learned  
Life is now  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Her to stay I'm alive (Didn't think I'd make it)  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new day  
And I feel Fine  
Here to say I'm alive (It's here you got to take it)
