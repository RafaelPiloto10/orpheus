I can't stand the morning light  
Now you've gone there ain't no-one  
Oh, to make it right  
The way you do  
Every day I fall more in love with you  
Knowing that you left  
This heart of mine  
You captured at the start  
And I know you know  
That I can't get through  
Am I livin' a lie when  
I reach for you?  
  
You gotta save me, save me  
Only you can keep me warm  
Above the storm  
You gotta save me, save me  
You know there ain't a world enough  
Without your love, ooh, hoo, hoo, love  
  
Gonna lay my head  
Try to rest my heart  
Dream my dreams  
But they're all of you  
And they fall apart  
The way I do  
Every night I fall more  
In love with you  
I'm praying for the day  
You turn around  
And make your love all mine  
And when I'm going down for  
The very last time  
You can throw me a line  
  
You gotta save me, save me  
Only you can keep me warm  
Above the storm  
You gotta save me, save me  
You know there ain't a world enough  
Without your love  
  
When do I get to be near you?  
For all time  
Hear what you say again  
  
And I know you know  
That I can't get through  
Am I livin' a lie when  
I reach for you?  
And when I'm goin' down for  
The very last time  
You can throw me a line  
You can keep me alive  
  
You gotta save me, save me  
Only you can keep me warm  
Above the storm  
You gotta save me, save me  
You know there ain't a world enough  
Without your love, ooh, hoo, hoo  
  
You gotta save me, save me  
Only you can keep me warm  
Above the storm  
You gotta save me, save me  
You know there ain't a world enough  
Without your love
