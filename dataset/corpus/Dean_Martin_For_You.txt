I will gather stars out of the blue  
For you for you  
I'll make a string of pearls out of the dew  
For you just for you  
  
Over the highway and over the street  
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet  
Oh there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do  
For you for you  
  
Over the highway and over the street  
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet  
Ah there ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do  
For you just for you
