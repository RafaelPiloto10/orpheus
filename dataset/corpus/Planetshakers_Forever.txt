[Verse:]:  
I hear the sound of a generation  
Lifting their voice  
Rising as one  
Now is the time for Your name to be lifted high  
  
[Verse 2:]:  
Forever we'll sing out the things You have done  
Nothing compares to Your power and love  
Now is the time for Your name to be lifted high  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
  
We lift Your name higher than anything  
King of king forever we will sing  
  
Chorus:  
Forever we will sing  
Glory to the King  
Forever... Forever  
Name above all name  
We will shout Your grace  
Forever... Forever  
  
Bridge:  
Forever... Forever  
Forever we will shout Your name
