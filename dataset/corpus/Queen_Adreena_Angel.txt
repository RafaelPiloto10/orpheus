A black soot stain  
Struck across the sky  
The shadow crept up the wall and stayed  
Eclipse in her daddies eye  
She prepared for an occupation  
She climed she cut away  
But with each cut the root grew deeper  
And she drown in his blood embrace  
So where are your angels?  
A dirty old claw caught at her breast  
Blood on the kitchen floor  
A tightrope yawning at her undress  
Her skyline all rip and torn  
She prepared for an occupation  
She climbed she cut away  
The crows to steal on her battlefield  
Sharpen her bloodied nail  
So where are your angels?  
Charlie's rack salt peter  
Pissing spit and claw  
The crows to steal on her batlefield  
She's down on the bedroom floor  
She collapse in a rain of whale spill  
She ride the briding spree  
She white feather blind  
On her washing line  
I cut cut cut cut her free
