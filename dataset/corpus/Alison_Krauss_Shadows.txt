Feat. Tony Rice  
  
Let me reach out Love and touch you, let me hold you for awhile  
I'd be known around the world, oh how I long to see you smile  
There's a shadow on the moon, and the waters here below  
Do not shine the way they should, and I love ya just in case you didn't know  
  
Let it go, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone,  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
  
Won't you lie down by me baby, run your fingers through my hands  
I'd be known around the town and still I do not understand  
Is it me or is it you, or the shadow of a dream  
Is it wrong to be in love, could it be the finest love I've ever seen  
  
Set it free, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind, and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door.  
  
Please kiss me gently darlin, where the river runs away  
From the mountains in the springtime, on a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around, as the shades of night grow deep  
As the morning stars grow dim, they will find us in the shadows fast asleep.  
  
Let it go, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone,  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door
