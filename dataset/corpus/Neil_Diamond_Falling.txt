I go off to work everyday  
You think there's no other way  
And when there's time left to play  
You're thinkin' about her all the time  
You keep it all to yourself  
You trust in nobody else  
And the pressure just builds  
It can make you go crazy  
Falling  
I'm falling in love, again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep  
Callin' your name once again, babe  
One more time, yeah  
The world is down on your back  
You know the things that you lack  
It really hard that's a fact  
When you want to do the right thing  
You got your doubts that you can  
Sometimes you don't understand  
What brings the best in a man  
Is it passion or power or  
Falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep  
Callin' your name once again, babe  
One more time, babe  
Fall into bed every night  
It seems you do nothing right  
You'd like to catch the next flight  
But you got your responsibilities  
She's feeling unsatisfied  
You feeling empty inside  
Like you've been took for a ride  
And there's no one at the steering wheel  
Falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep, callin' your name  
And I'm falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep, callin' your name  
And I'm falling  
I'm falling in love again
