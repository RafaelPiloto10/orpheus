Love can be a game for two  
But a real love  
Take ya more than a lttle bit of time  
  
Ya gotta keep on makin' it  
Though your arms are achin'  
Your knees are shakin'  
Your heart keeps breakin' down  
That's what life is about  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh wo  
Let there be music  
Let there be candlelight  
Let there be love  
Let there be young hearts  
Sendin' up hungry sparks  
Let there be love  
  
Life  
Like a smile in the Big Boy's eye  
He lit a little light  
'N brought it all in, in under seven days  
  
He said "I'm makin' em, a man and woman  
I'll let run but before my work is through  
There's still one thing that I got to do"  
  
Chorus:  
Let there be music  
Let there be candlelight  
Let there be love  
Let there be young hearts  
Sendin' up hungry sparks  
Let there be love  
  
Bridge:  
You wonder how it happens  
You question if there'll ever come a day  
We'll get your head out of your way  
  
Deep in the heart a' me  
The music, it plays the beat  
Its like a part a' me is turnin', turnin', turnin'  
Don'cha try to defeat it  
'Cause I know ya just can't beat it  
Somethin' inside a' me is
burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin'  
  
Repeat Chorus to fade:
