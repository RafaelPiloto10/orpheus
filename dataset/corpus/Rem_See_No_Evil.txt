What I want, I want now  
And it's a whole lot more, anyhow  
I wanna climb a mountain  
I wanna jump, jump, jump, jump a mountain  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
I get ideas, notions  
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean  
I get your point, you're so sharp  
Gettin good reactions with 'BeBo' talk  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
[SOLO]  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
Walkin' hand in hand with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' through Manhattan with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' hand in hand with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' in Jackson with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' in the world with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' and talkin' with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin', walkin' and talkin' with the one I love
