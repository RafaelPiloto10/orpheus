we've got a lot of questions  
we've got a lot to learn  
so tired of solving problems  
too many bridges burned  
we see it all so clearly and still we close our eyes  
why should we understand it?  
what good is knowing why?  
I know that life can be filled with these changes  
I know there's times when it feels like I'm falling  
I know something in my life will change again  
  
now I've got a lot of questions  
I've got a lot to learn  
I'm tired of solving problems  
too many bridges burned  
I can't change what's in the past  
I want to move ahead  
I want to understand it  
give me the reason why  
  
I'm tired of running these circles in my life  
I've seen the future it changes before my eyes  
and I know that there is something that's going to change in my life  
I know my life will change again
