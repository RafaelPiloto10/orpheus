Strange how my heart beats  
To find myself upon your shore.  
Strange how I still feel  
My loss of comfort gone before.  
Cool waves wash over  
And drift away with dreams of youth  
So time is stolen  
I cannot hold you long enough.  
And so this is where I should be now  
  
Days and nights falling by  
Days and nights falling by me.  
I know of a dream I should be holding  
Days and nights falling by  
Days and nights falling by me.  
  
Cool waves wash over  
And drift away with reams of youth  
So time is stolen  
I cannot hold you long enough.  
Soft blue horizons  
Reach far into my childhood days  
As you are rising  
To bring me my forgotten ways  
  
Strange how I falter  
To find I'm standing in deep water  
Strange how my heart beats  
To find I'm standing on your shore
