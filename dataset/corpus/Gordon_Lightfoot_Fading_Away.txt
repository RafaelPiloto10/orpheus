I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea  
In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
They sailed right up to me, I said, "What's it all about  
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out  
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel"  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam  
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
Fading away, fading away
