When I say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why don't you believe me?  
When I say I miss you  
When I'm not there with you  
Why don't you believe me?  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine?  
  
When I say just call me  
Anytime you want me  
Why don't you believe me?  
When I say I'll be there  
Now until forever  
Why don't you believe me?  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine?  
  
So, darlin', don't be afraid  
I'll never leave you alone  
I don't care how long it takes  
I'm willing to wait  
'Til you make my heart your home  
  
When you say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why don't you believe me?  
Believe me  
Why don't you believe me?  
Believe me  
Why don't you believe me?
