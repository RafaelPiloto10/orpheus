Locked in a kiss, outsiders cease to exist  
We'll shut it out (of the fist)  
Outsiders cease to exist  
We'll shut it out  
Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea  
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say  
Dozing off the TV drones  
House key makes them turn and glance for home  
Locked in a kiss, outsiders cease to exist  
Flayed of the fist  
Outsiders cease to exist  
We'll shut it out
