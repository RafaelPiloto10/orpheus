Uno due tre  
Well, if you don't like it  
Go ahead, find yourself a saint  
Go ahead now, try to find a boy  
Who's gonna be all the things I ain't  
What you need is a plastic doll  
With a fresh coat of paint  
Who's gonna sit through the madness  
And always act so quaint  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
With your new friends  
You're really making a scene  
I've seen you bouncing around  
From machine to machine  
And you know  
They're never real  
They're never what they seem  
And you can try to generate some warmth  
And you see just what I mean  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And if I'm acting like a king  
Well, that's 'cause I'm a human being  
I want too many things  
And that's 'cause I'm a human being  
And if I've got to dream  
I said well, I'm a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah  
I'm a human being  
  
And I just go around with my head hung down  
Just like a human being and all those human beings  
I can hold my head so high  
Just like a human, I'm a riffraff human being  
  
Won't you give me a little sip  
Why don't you try me on a drag of that cigarette  
Why don't you try to give me something that  
I'll never ever forget  
But now don't you blow it all  
On a million dollar bet  
Because you're liable to lose it  
On the best lovin' you've had yet  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And if I'm acting like a king  
Well that's 'cause I'm a human being  
And if I want too many things  
That's 'cause I'm a human being  
And if I've got to dream  
I said well, I'm a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah  
I'm a human being  
  
And I just go around with my head hung down  
Just like a human being and all those human beings  
I can hold my head so high  
Just like a human, I'm a riff raff human being  
  
In fact I'm talking about the human race  
Trying to cover up the big disgrace  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah  
Well I may think that this whole scene  
Is too appalling for me  
Or I may be the type who is just a mad about  
Everything that I see  
But I can't cover this with history  
Or make it just what I want it to be  
I'm blowing my change on the fan magazines  
With all the Hollywood refugees  
Said yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
And If I'm acting like a king  
That's 'cause I'm a human being  
And if I want too many things  
That's 'cause I'm a human being  
And if I've got to dream  
I said well, I'm a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah  
I'm a human being
