Oh, I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
They've got to find their way from here  
Oh, show us the way  
  
If they only knew  
Oh, show us the light  
Show them what light?  
  
It shines from within  
You make your own day  
You make your own night  
And sometimes you win  
  
Oh, show us the way  
But you always get through  
Oh, show us the light  
  
Oh, why do they come and ask for more?  
They've got stars they don't have wishes for  
They're just givin' up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive?  
  
I'm wonderin' why, I'm wonderin' how  
They're gonna bail themselves out now  
Oh, give us this day  
I'm shakin' my head  
Oh, keep us through night  
  
Oh, I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
They've got to find their way from here  
Oh, show us the way  
If they only knew  
Oh, show us the light  
  
Oh, why do they come and ask for more?  
They've got stars they don't have wishes for  
They're just givin' up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive?  
  
It's not like it was before  
When they call I won't come running  
It was so long ago  
I left them on their own  
Oh, how do the fools survive?
