Times have changed and times are strange  
Here I come, but I ain't the same  
Mama, I'm coming home  
Times gone by seems to be  
You could have been a better friend to me  
Mama, I'm coming home  
  
Took me in and you drove me out  
Yeah, you had me hypnotized  
Lost and found and turned around  
By the fire in your eyes  
  
You made me cry, you told me lies  
But, I can't stand to say goodbye  
Mama, I'm coming home  
I could be right, I could be wrong  
Hurts so bad, it's been so long  
Mama, I'm coming home  
  
Selfish love yeah we're both alone  
The ride before a fall  
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone  
I just got to have it all  
  
I've seen your face a hundred times  
Everyday we've been apart  
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah  
  
'Cause mama, mama, I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
  
You took me in and you drove me out  
Yeah, you had me hypnotized  
Lost and found and turned around  
By the fire in your eyes  
  
I've seen your face a thousand times  
Every day we've been apart  
And I don't care about the sunshine, yeah  
  
'Cause mama, mama, I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home
