So familiar and overwhelmingly warm  
This one, this form I hold now.  
Embracing you, this reality here,  
This one, this form I hold now, so  
Wide eyed and hopeful.  
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.  
  
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,  
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside  
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in  
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.
