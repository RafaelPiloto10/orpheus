I gave you joy, your best of joy  
I am the moonlight you are the spring, ours life's a sacred thing  
You know I always will love you, I am forever  
I am the one who came when you fell down  
I was the only one around (the only one)  
When things would hurt you  
I am forever, wasn't it I who said that you are free?  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you  
I am forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever  
  
I am your friend, through thick and thin  
We need each other, we'll never part, our love is from the heart  
We never say I don't need you, We are forever  
I am the one who said that you are free  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be (the only one), and nothing would cheer you  
I am forever, wasn't it I who carried you around?  
When all the walls came tumbling down  
  
When things would hurt you  
I am forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever  
You are the sun that lights up the sky, when things are shady  
Let come what may we do get by, I was the only one around (the only one)  
When things would hurt you  
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever, our love is strong  
We are forever, we are forever, oh right  
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever  
I am forever, I am forever
