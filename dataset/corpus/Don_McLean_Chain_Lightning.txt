Sometimes when I'm thinkin' that love's not around  
My heart begins sinkin', I don't hear a sound  
And the world is in blackness, no light shines on me  
I suffer no blindness, no one can I see  
Then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire  
And the silence is broken, and the night is on fire.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel.  
Who know's where it strikes or when it will hit,  
How long it will last, or when it will quit.  
  
In the forest I'm burning, struck down by the blast  
The fever is churning, and the heat rises fast.  
And those standing nearest can show their concern  
But I swear if they touch me that they too will burn.  
They fear for their lives for death will soon dwell  
In the warmth of your love is the fire of hell.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame  
And love will soon shatter what it cannot tame  
And the cycle continues, from life into dust  
For I am now in you with the fire of lust.  
And I hear the explosion, of thunder and rain,  
The water is falling, the ashes remain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Indian's tell us that the Phoenix can rise  
From the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes  
And watch beautiful colours from black and from grey  
Be formed into wings and take me away  
Where evil is darkness and goodness is light  
And love is the lightning that cuts through the night  
And strikes only once in a dark place in time  
And forms a gold stairway that all of us climb.
