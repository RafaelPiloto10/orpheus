Sin and its ways grow old  
All of my heart turns to stone  
And I'm left with no strength to arise  
How You need to be lifted high  
Sin and its ways lead to pain  
Left here with hurt and with shame  
So no longer will I leave Your side  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
And even now that I'm inside Your house  
Help me not to grow prideful again  
Don't let me forsake sacrifice  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
And if I'm blessed with the riches of kings  
How could I ever feel that it was me?  
For You brought me from darkness to light  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
And Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
Oh Jesus, You'll be lifted high, oh, You'll be lifted high  
Oh, You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high, yeah, yeah
