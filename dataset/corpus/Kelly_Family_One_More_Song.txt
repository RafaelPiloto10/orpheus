Holding back all my trouble  
That accumulated over time  
And now I can't seem to define  
You and I were like brothers  
We stuck together in hard times  
But now it all seems to decline  
I've written...  
Chorus:  
One more song  
Before everything goes wrong  
One more song  
For keeping us going on  
Come on now: One more song  
Before everything goes wrong  
One more song  
For keeping us going on  
All the noise and all the trouble  
Might have made us lose our mind  
When all we need  
Is just a little time  
Everybody:  
Chorus  
Ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on  
Ride on into the sun  
Ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on  
Ride on into the sun  
When you're young life is easy  
But then the table turns around  
And then you seem to realise  
I'll sing you...  
Chorus  
And on, and on, oh yeah  
Chorus  
Before everything goes wrong  
We got a little time  
And now I can't seem to define  
I'll sing you one more song
