Barker sing me a song  
Instead of counting trees,  
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker  
Live it up, shine my shoes  
  
Fly me to the moon ,  
Never before have I seen the light, Mr Barker  
Then the moment of depression fell around , Mr Barker  
And the changes of expression to a frown, My friend Barker  
  
There must be something there  
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr Barker

Fly me to the moon,  
Never before have I seen the light (fade out )
