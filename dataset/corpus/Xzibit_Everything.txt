[Chorus]  
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen  
I remember underage drinking at sixteen  
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen  
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything  
  
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me  
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet  
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat  
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly  
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions  
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position  
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag  
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass  
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out  
Picking the shit up where I left off  
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel  
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle  
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business  
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance  
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me  
And make that money stack higher than giraffes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack  
So it will leave no shells at the scene  
Where I was getting my kid back  
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up  
On hard to make the west defined a united fund  
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck  
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California  
Where people fake it 'till they make it  
Or take it with their hand gun  
Take your chances, swing, try to land one  
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness  
My symphony deliver something classic  
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it  
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?  
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity  
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony  
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back  
Gave my girl a son and my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in  
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins  
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in  
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything  
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind  
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind  
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors  
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message  
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence  
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence  
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me  
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy  
  
[Chorus]
