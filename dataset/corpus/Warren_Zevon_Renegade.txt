Some prayers never reach the sky  
Some wounds never heal  
They still say someday the South will rise  
Man, I want to see that deal  
  
I don't want to grow old gracefully  
I don't want to go 'til it's too late  
I'll be some old man in the road somewhere  
Kneeling down in the dust by the side of the interstate  
  
[Chorus]  
I am a renegade  
I've been a rebel all my days  
I am a renegade  
I've been a rebel all my days  
  
We were hopelessly outnumbered  
It was a lost cause all along  
But when we heard the bugles call  
We swore we'd stand or fall together right or wrong  
  
We ain't seen no reconstruction here  
Just the scorched earth all around  
And the high school band played "Dixieland"  
While they tore our tattered flags and banners down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some prayers never reach the sky  
Some wars never end  
Some dreams refuse to die  
Next time I would rather break than bend  
  
[Chorus]
