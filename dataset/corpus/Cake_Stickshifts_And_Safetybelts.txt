Stickshifts and safetybelts  
Bucket seats have all got to go  
When we're driving in the car  
It makes my baby seem so far  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
But when we're driving in my Malibu  
It?s easy to get right next to you  
I say, "Baby, scoot over, please"  
And then she's right there next to me  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
Alright  
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese  
Yeah, but when we're driving far I need my baby  
I need my baby next to me  
  
Well, stickshifts and safetybelts  
Bucket seats have all got to go  
When we're driving in the car  
It makes my baby seem so far  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
Alright  
Alright
