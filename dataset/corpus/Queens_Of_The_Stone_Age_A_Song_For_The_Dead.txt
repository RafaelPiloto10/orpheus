It's late enough to go drivin  
And see what's mine  
That's a study of dying  
How to do it right  
You're a holy roller  
Get your bed in the loose  
If you're hanging around  
I'm holdin' the noose  
  
Come a little bit closer  
And get on tight  
In a horse rollin' over  
Just a track in the line  
Fuck it  
  
Come on, let's go drivin'  
Come on, let's take a little ride  
That's the study of dying  
How to do it right
