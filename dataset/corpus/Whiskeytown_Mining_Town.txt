Said you came from a Mining Town  
Til they closed the mining down  
Said your daddy was a drinker  
He had a picture of Jesus on his sinker  
  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
This town's only five miles wide  
Look everywhere there's a road sign  
  
Pawn shops and places to hide  
And cops sit around hungry  
Waiting to dine  
Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Said you came from a Mining Town  
  
'Til they closed the mining down  
Said your momma was a drinker  
She had a picture of Jesus on her sink  
And Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight
