Well, it's been another doggone day  
I'm ready for this trashed out town  
I'll be doing all those crazy things  
That make the other heads spin around  
  
They're tellin' me the ride ain't worth the fall  
Oh, but stop me if you can, I want it all  
  
'Cause I'm ready, yes, I'm ready  
To break free, ready to break free  
  
I'm tired of just killing time  
Talkin' 'bout the days gone by  
So I'm takin' on the world tonight  
I'm out to let my spirit fly  
  
Oh, they say what goes around will come around  
But there's nothin' in this world to hold me down
