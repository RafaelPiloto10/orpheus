I never felt like this with someone, I never knew I could feel this way at all  
Predestination by appointment, storybook realities are coming true  
I was scared, you look so helpless, the lust was dressed in good disguise  
  
I took you on to meet my mother  
Just like me, she fell straight in love with you  
You took me to your own apartment, was it me or does the night do things to
you  
You read from Venus and Adonis, so honey how could I resist  
  
C'mon baby we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fights  
I lift you up, never let you down  
I'll be the jester, babe, and you'll be the crown  
We're instinctively impulsive, we're animals  
  
A body like yours should be arrested, honey I should be locked up in a cage  
We are flesh, we are carnal cut, oh we are human  
Oh babe got these eyes we can't contend  
Smoke alarm is going off again, I guess I'm gonna have to cool you down  
  
Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight  
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Instinctively impulsive, we're animals  
  
Some girls may turn me up, but only you, baby, turn me on  
When we touch it's so explosive, it seems my life's been leading to this  
  
Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight  
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Is it rhythm, is it magic, we're animals  
Ooh baby, we're animals.
