Lord I'm singing You this message up to Heaven  
Asking you to send me down another angel  
I've been looking for a long time for someone to get her off my mind  
But you know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call my darling  
If You can think of someone to fit that description  
Lord could You help me one more time?  
But I know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
It's my fault I lost the first one You sent to me  
I didn't know 'til she was gone how much she meant to me  
She loved me but I was blind, I bet I do a whole lot better next time  
But I know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call darling  
If You can think of someone to fit my description  
Lord, could You help ole Hank one more time?  
But I know Lord, yeah angels are hard to find  
One like that right there Lord, angels are hard to find
