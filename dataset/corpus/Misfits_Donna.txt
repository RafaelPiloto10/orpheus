Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna  
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna  
  
I had a girl  
Donna was her name  
Since she left me  
I've never been the same  
Cause I love my girl  
Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm left all alone  
All by myself  
To wander and roam  
Cause I love my girl  
Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?  
  
Well, darlin', now that you're gone  
I don't know what I'll do  
All the time and all my love for yo-ou-ou  
  
I had a girl  
Donna was her name  
Since she left me  
I've never been the same  
Cause I love my girl  
Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?  
  
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna  
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
