I'm not so bulletproof  
But this is something  
I could never say to you  
This sometimes buries me  
And I don't know if this is someone I can be  
  
I tell myself it's right  
Still feels so wrong  
  
It's better than nothing  
I'd rather not be here all by myself  
It's better than nothing here with someone else  
It's better than nothing  
I'd rather not be standing here alone  
It's better than feeling like you're on your own  
  
I'm not so culpable  
I never meant for this to get out of control
