"Hmmm, so you're the one they're talkin' about.  
Let me see if this is real."  
  
[Q-Tip]  
When I do it, eyes lookin' at me when the  
Music should be the only thing you see. It's the  
Score to a cinematic oddity. Lettin'  
Off shit, hit your ass repeatedly. Acro-  
Batic, wha. I'll pull something through your chest-piece.  
Before she came home, pit-stopped breast be.  
Watched the movie, and smoked a philly and  
Took a hit of D. She actin' all silly and,  
I pull the brothers in depressed situations. When the  
Thing hit the 'phere, we risin' up to the occasion.  
You're killin' me wit' petty, little rap beat.  
'No fingerprints' is how my expert-ass be.  
While I'm at it, I'ma stand my ground right  
Here. Spotlight, where the chicks is found.  
You see this little-ass club we in? Yo, it's  
Mine, intertwine, wink your bun, do it to the drum.  
  
[Jessica Rivera]  
"Yeah, that's alright.  
But I know you can do better than that! c'mon! c'mon!"  
  
[Q-Tip]  
Alright then. I guess we stand the same ground, same  
Page and want to freak shit. I want to  
Eat it, watch you beat it, cum  
Real hard than repeatin'. Yo!  
The frivolous rap song he rap about  
Is no good. Remove all the crap about  
My dogs is all in for the national.  
No passion, then I guess they be cashin' out.  
I keep my eyes on things and  
I keep my shine on BLING!  
My peoples ain't nothin' to toy wit'.  
Professional, leavin' a boy stiff.  
You doin' all while you're really talkin'.  
You need to get gun or get walkin'.  
This greedy-ass country we in? I guess it's  
Mine, intertwine, wink ya bun, do it to the drum.  
  
What 'chu really want to do?  
I want to really do it right.  
What 'chu really want to do?  
Grab ya hands, hug ya tight.  
For real?  
For real.  
Well, what 'chu feel?  
Well, what 'chu feel?  
We can  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Do it, do it, do it.  
Do it, do it,  
What 'chu really want to do?  
I want to really do it right.  
What 'chu really want to do?  
Grab ya hands, hug ya tight.  
For real?

Grab ya hands, hug ya tight.  
For real?  
For real.  
Well, what 'chu feel?

Do it, Do it, Do it, Do it  
  
[Q-Tip]  
"So, I was wondering what would happen, how would you feel if  
I, inside your bedroom, I took off all your clothes, and  
Took all mines off, and, uh, I got the portable DVD thing,  
And, got the, right connections. I stick it in and put on top  
Your spa basing to get you all fucked up over the bounce. And  
Then, you can take it off and then"
