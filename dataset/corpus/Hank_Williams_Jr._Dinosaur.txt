Hey man them ain't high heeled sneakers  
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots  
And that ain't rock and roll your playin  
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues  
Your singing a song about making love to your drummer  
Well gay guitar pickers don't turn me on  
And we don't all get in to Donna summers  
Do you happen to know any old Hank Williams songs!  
  
Cause you see I'm a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me maam  
But where's the door!  
  
Used to be I had a lot of fun in the old hangout  
We'd get stoned at the jukebox to stay out of fights  
Now and then we'd light a little smoke  
In the truck out back!  
And a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right  
And you know these flashing lights sure make me dizzy  
And this disco's very strange to my ears  
Looks like they turned the longhorn into a spaceship  
And I'll be leaving just a soon as I finish this beer  
  
Cause you see I'm a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me mam  
But where's the door!  
  
Give us our hats  
Excuse Me mam  
Where the door!
