Oh, I'm drawn to you  
Like a burnin' flame  
But somebody's waitin'  
That bears my name  
Oh, Lord knows I'd love to love you  
Cause you know I'm just a man  
But I can't  
Not from where I stand.  
  
You see I made a promise  
When I put on that rign  
And I plan to kep it, babe  
It's a sacred thing  
Well, heaven knows I'm tempted  
I hope you understand  
That I can't  
Not from where I stand.  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Oh, from where I stand  
There's a golden band  
And I swear I couldn't stand  
To lose it all  
So, I better run  
While I still can  
Cause I can't, babe  
Not from where I stand.  
  
No I can't, not from where I stand  
Yeah, not from where I stand
