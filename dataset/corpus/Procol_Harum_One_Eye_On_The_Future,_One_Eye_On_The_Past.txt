We'll raise our toast to pleasures past  
They came so quick and went so fast  
Idle boasts, crazy ghosts  
We'll make our toast and drain the glass  
We're know we're out of favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
Well time may heal, and absence mend  
We'll raise our glass to absent friends  
[ere] they dwell we wish them well  
To those we wronged we'll make amends  
We're know we're out of favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
It's time to change and start anew  
To leave our home for pastures new  
Where we go, ah, we won't know  
It's something that we got to do  
We're don't expect no favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we'll keep one eye on the past
