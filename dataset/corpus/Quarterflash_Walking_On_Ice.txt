I walk on ice  
I play with fire  
For loving you, baby  
I dance on wire  
Oh I can't sleep at night  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice  
  
Who broke you down  
Who's there to blame  
Who tore you up inside  
And left the pain  
Oh, someone burned your life  
And everyday I pay that price  
Everyday I'm walking on ice  
  
Time after time I wake up and find  
I want you, I'm calling  
Like always I'm falling on ice  
Walking on ice  
  
I can't blink an eye  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice
