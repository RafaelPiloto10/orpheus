[Verse 1]  
Just take me with all my stupid flaws  
Changing means like shooting in the dark  
Patience, please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to be  
Me, me, I want it just as bad  
Forgive me, wish I could change the past  
Take it, cause, I'll never be as perfect as you want  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I think you're confusing me with somebody else  
I won't apologize for being myself  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Verse 2]  
don't judge me, just gotta let me be  
Accept me, although I'm incomplete  
My imperfections make me unique, that's my belief  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Bridge]  
Never say never, anything is possible  
Always been a rebel, overcoming obstacles  
I can't give you perfect, but I can give you forever  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Outro]  
With all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
  
(You got to love me, you got love me...)  
(You got to love me, you got love me...)
