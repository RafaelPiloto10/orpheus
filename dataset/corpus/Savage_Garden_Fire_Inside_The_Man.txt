Woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
Whenever I feel like just giving up  
Whenever my dreams just fade away  
I just return to my heart 'cause I know that I'll find you  
There yes I will.  
  
And when the world is closing in  
You come save me once again.  
  
'Cause woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
Well, there's never been a boy, who's luckier  
There's never been more grateful man  
And although I don't show it and I  
I know what I've got with you  
Yes I do.  
  
'Cause Woman I need your guiding hand,  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
And if there's a storm that's close at hand  
You'll push it away, you'll understand  
And I'll do anything  
Just to please you  
I'll do anything just to know that I can hold on to you.  
  
Whenever I feel like just giving up  
Whenever my dreams just fade away  
I just return to my heart 'cause I know that I'll find you  
There yes I will.  
  
'Cause woman I need it  
Woman I need it  
Woman I need it  
I need it

Woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
'Cause woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
You are.
