Cut myself open wide  
Breach inside  
Help yourself  
To all I have to give  
And then you help yourself again  
And then complain  
That you didn't like the way  
I put the knife in wrong  
You didn't like the way  
My blood spilled on your brand new floor  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough  
  
Sacrifice my life  
Neglect my kids and wife  
All for you to be happy  
All those sleepness nights  
And countless fights to give you more  
And then you say how dare that  
I didn't write you back  
I must be too good for you  
I only care about myself  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough
