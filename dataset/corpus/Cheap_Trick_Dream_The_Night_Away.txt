It's 5 o'clock, I think I'll find my way downtown  
I try to turn my mind off, but I don't know how  
  
Let me dream the night, dream the night away  
Don't make me dream the night, dream the night away  
  
How can I help but hate the way I feel?  
Make sense of memories that won't make them real?  
  
Whoa!  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
Sometimes the love you make can break your heart  
Just when it seems so easy, then it all falls apart  
  
I feel so helpless when I think of you  
I never said those things I thought you knew  
  
Hey!  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
(You got to dream the night)  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
