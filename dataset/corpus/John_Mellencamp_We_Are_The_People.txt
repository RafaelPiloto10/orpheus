If you're feeling shut down  
May my thoughts be with you  
If you're a black man bein' beat down  
And shoved all around  
May my thoughts be with you  
If your world's getting' a little too tough  
You know, our thoughts bein' with you  
Hey, I know, that it's crazy out there  
And my thoughts are with you  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind  
  
If you are one of the homeless  
May my thoughts be with you  
If you are scared and alone  
You know, our thoughts are with you  
If you are one of the fortunate ones  
We all know, it's lonely up there  
We understand, that nobody's got it made  
So our thoughts are with you  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind  
  
You see yourself as a leader  
May my thoughts be with you.  
If you try to divide and conquer  
We'll rise up against you  
We know, only the strong will survive  
But the meek will inherit  
So if you got a coat of arms  
Oh friend  
I suggest, we wear it  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind
