'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life  
Trying to make ends meet  
You're a slave to money, then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places  
Where all the veins meet, yeah  
  
No change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
But I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
  
No, no, no  
  
Well I never pray  
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah  
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah  
I let the melody shine  
Let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now  
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now  
  
No change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
And I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I can't change, I can't change it  
  
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life  
Trying to make ends meet  
Trying to find some money, then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places  
Where all the veins meet, yeah  
  
You know I can't change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
And I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no  
I can't change  
Can't change my body  
No, no, no  
  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
Been down, ever been down, ever been down  
Ever been down, ever been down  
That why
