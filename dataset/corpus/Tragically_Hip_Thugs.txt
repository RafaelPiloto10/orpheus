Everyone's got their breaking point  
With me it's spiders and with you it's me  
Thugs in perpetuity  
When we're excited little birds around the feeder  
The cat's indifferent or he's just furious  
It seems that he's never neither  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Hair bird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog  
To build her nest she said I've looked around  
And I like your hair the best  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Ruby, honey are you mad at your man?
