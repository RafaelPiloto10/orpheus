Tonight I hold to nothing  
but the feelings in my soul  
My heart overflows with emotion  
I just can't control  
There's someone you are going to  
But tonight  
I just can't tell right from wrong  
  
Let me be yours until tomorrow  
Let me be yours until tomorrow  
Give me one night of your life  
Just be mine 'til the dawn  
  
Tomorrow the real world  
Will come crashing down on me  
I know I must lose you and that's the way it has to be  
But tonight I see no boundries  
So I beg you before my chance is gone  
  
Let me be yours until tomorrow  
Let me be yours until tomorrow  
Give me one night of your life  
So I can go on.  
  
Till the dawn's intrusion  
Ends this sweet illusion  
Make believe you're mine, love  
This is not goodbye, love,  
All I ask is one night, till the morning sunlight  
Won't you stay here in my arms  
And baby, let me be yours until tomorrow  
Let me be yours until tomorrow.
