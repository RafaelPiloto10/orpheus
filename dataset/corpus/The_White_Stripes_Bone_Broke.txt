Hey, hey  
  
Look closer, you can see all the money  
I got a dollar bill in the cockpit  
Surprised that your wallet is a black hole  
I got another job at the liquor store, damn!  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
  
They got a white pony in the stable  
And ride him when the doggie isn't able  
But he doesn't really care because they pay him  
But, still, a black suit is gonna shake him down  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
Hey, broke as I'll ever be  
  
It look another way, girl, I'm telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
And your mother put her money into platinum  
And now you never have to pay attention, do ya, do ya?  
  
Uh huh  
  
Yeah, I'm kneeling on a brick with my nails  
I'm telling her the money's in the mail  
Keeps shiny in my box, never fake it  
But now the brick breaker's gonna break it down  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
  
Look another way, girl, I'm telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
Your mother put her money into platinum  
So that you wouldn't have to pay attention, right?
