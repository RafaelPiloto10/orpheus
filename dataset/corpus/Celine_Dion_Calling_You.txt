A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Some place better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me  
I am calling you  
  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and can't sleep  
But we both know a change in coming  
Coming close sweet release  
  
I am calling you  
I know you hear me  
I am calling you oh
