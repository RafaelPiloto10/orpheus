My name is Billie, And im freaking out  
I thought before I was  
And I can't get it figured out  
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers  
Screaming my memories  
As if I was never there  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Im like a punk rocker on labor day  
How the hell did I work so hard  
To be born this way?  
I never learned to read or write so well  
But I can play the guitar  
Until it hurts like hell  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
If this is what you call the good life  
I want a better way to die  
If this is what you call the good life  
I want a better way to die  
  
Oh, I dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Dont wanna think about this road  
It doesnt matter anyway  
I wanna start a revolution  
I wanna hear it on my radio  
Ill put it off another day  
I want a new conspiricy  
And the silence of a thousand cries  
So hurry up  
I want a better way to die  
  
Im running late to Somewhere Now  
I dont want to be  
Where the future and promises  
Ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise  
Or bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side  
Ever get so full  
  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about the road  
Somewhere now  
Oh I wanna start a revolution  
Somewhere now  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
Don't wanna think about tomorrow!  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
Don't wanna think about the road  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
I wanna hear it on my radio, I'll put it on another day!  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)
