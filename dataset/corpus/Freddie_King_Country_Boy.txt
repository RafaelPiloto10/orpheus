[Freddy]  
I'm just a little country boy  
Lookin' for my pride and joy  
I came to the city just to see what I could see  
I just made it in your town  
Thought I'd take a look around  
I wanna tell you baby  
Just how good you look to me  
My mama told me there will be sometime like this  
She told me there would be some moments here will flip  
She warned me of a lot of things I had to do  
But she didn't tell me I would meet somebody like you  
Somebody take a chance with me  
I want you to romance with me  
You might say I'm coy  
'Cause I'm just a little country boy  
[Margaret]  
I'm just a little country girl  
Living in a great big world  
I met some country boy  
And I've got some news for you  
He swept me right off my feet  
Made my life complete  
My heart skipped a beat  
'Cause he thrilled me through and through  
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo  
[Sung together]  
We gonna march together down the aisle today  
We gonna see the preacher in the business way  
Oh I'm so happy can't you see I'm thrilled with joy?  
[Freddy]  
(Can't believe how this could happen to a country boy)  
So come and take me by the hand (M)  
Let me be your lovin' man (F)  
I'm in a great big world (M)  
My baby is a country girl (F)  
I found my toy (M)  
I'm a country boy (F)
