She likes it hot, she likes it humid  
She likes my cake, and she's not stupid  
She likes my sugar, she likes my bread  
I'm ready to attack  
She comes at night, when I'm asleep  
Without a sound, just like a thief  
She comes to crawl, under my bed  
I'm ready to attack  
Priscilla oh Priscilla  
You last resistant chiller  
Priscilla oh Priscilla  
Tonight I'm going to kill ya  
She lives in my kitchen  
Down in the shade  
She likes leftovers  
And throwaways  
I'm on a diet  
And she is fat  
I'm ready to attack  
Priscilla oh Priscilla  
You last resistant chiller  
Priscilla oh Priscilla  
Tonight I'm going to kill ya  
I can't do it I can't do it at all  
She turns a man into killer  
This cockroach named Priscilla  
This cockroach named Priscilla  
You're gonna be here  
You're gonna be there  
You're gonna be everywhere  
I'm coming after you  
I'm coming after you  
You're gonna be now  
You're gonna be then  
You're gonna be out and in  
I'm coming after you  
I'm coming after you  
You're gonna be saint  
You're gonna be sin  
You're gonna lose and win  
I'm coming after you  
I'm coming after you  
Priscilla oh Priscilla  
Tonight I'm going to kill ya
