You think I'm cool  
But I am not  
You think that I am nonchalant  
You think I'm hard  
That I lay the part  
Don't be fooled  
You are my heart  
Oh Babe I'm just so tired of being on the run  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away  
  
Without love what have we got  
All these things don't mean a lot  
Let's disregard the past and start  
A new fire  
From this old spark  
Let's take this love  
And make it hotter than the sun  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away  
  
What am I looking for?  
What am I dreaming of?  
When you are the woman that I really love  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away
