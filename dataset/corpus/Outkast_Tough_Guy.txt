(feat. You. G. K.)  
(Shaft Soundtrack)  
[Chorus:]  
Everbody on the streets,  
This a lil thesis coming from me  
When I throw up baggets, sitting at the bar  
Or smokin a lil red life in my car  
I don't know what you came to see,  
Nigga just out here feeding my kids  
Throw up the duece and let me slide on by  
Cuz everybody wants to be a tough guy  
[Verse One: Big Boi]  
Crusin down the street, minding my business cuz I'm trill  
Stopped at the atm, grabbed a thousand dollar bill  
Now I peel, like apples and peaches because I'm chill  
And niggas around my city respect me because I'm real  
But still, the things I see from day to day it hurts me  
When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville  
Niggas wanna hurt me, absurd g  
I know it, betta believe I tote something for it  
But I gotta be smoking?????????????? Know it  
And I'm not the type of person be riding around yo block just flashy  
Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas, G  
Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about Outkast G  
Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me  
You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then  
But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend  
I'm calling your bluff, go'n and buck, I got my squad we trapping  
Ac gone slap this nigga, he aint bucking, he just yapping, yea!  
[Chorus:]  
[Verse Two: Bun B]  
Say, we took it from packing the pistols,  
To jacking this missiles  
To stacking my crystals  
Now my torpedo's even cracking your missile  
When we start, aint no stopping us  
We too smart and too popular  
Take yo toys and we? Topple em  
Resort to the dopplar  
To the agent underground well known as S
