Hey you upon this ship of fools  
I have found you bending your own rules  
Thank you I don't mind if I do  
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew  
  
There was such a flaming time  
I never will forget  
It was all so easy then  
This is my one regret  
  
Hey you my angel in blue  
Mother Nature saved her best for you  
Green grow the lilacs on the wall  
Heaven help them, catch them as they fall  
  
Hey you angel in disguise  
What is your angle what is your surprise  
Hey you fever that is mine  
What is your game plan what is your design  
  
Reality brings mystery  
And ne'er the twain shall meet  
And all of my wild horses  
Cannot pull you off your feet  
  
Hey you angel on my mind  
All around me til the end of time  
Thank you I don't mind if I do  
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew  
  
There was such a flaming time  
I never will forget  
It was all so easy then  
This is my one regret  
  
Hey you my angel in blue  
I'm entangled tell me what to do  
Green grow the lilacs on the wall  
Heaven help them catch them as they fall
