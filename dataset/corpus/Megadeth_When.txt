No hears a word I say  
And my prayers are never answered  
But you'll never see the pain inside of me  
Stabbing me over and over and over  
I trusted you and I loved you  
And you spit back in my face  
How could you do this to me?  
When will you stop trying to hurt me?  
  
I've walked a minefield for you  
A career in hell with you  
I have made it through the things  
Others would surely die just watching  
And the oath I take on this day  
Is to know that you will be repaid  
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl  
Until then, until I see your world implode  
I wish you death and suffering  
Misery to spare  
Time to release your pain  
Face the last enemy  
I am the last thing you will know  
The last thing you will see  
I see your death surrounding me  
I know you, yes I do  
I know you  
  
When no words are spoken and please are ignored  
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?  
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard  
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?  
  
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies  
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life  
  
When judgement has failed you  
When your own heart's impaled you  
Your wandering mind has destroyed you  
Will you ever know when?  
  
When you give everything and the feeling is gone  
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?  
When you take everything and you stay too long  
When there's nothing left, did you take enough?  
  
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies  
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life  
  
When judgment has failed you  
When your own heart's impaled you  
Your wandering mind has destroyed you  
Will you ever know when?
