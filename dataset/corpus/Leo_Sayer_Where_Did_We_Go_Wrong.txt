Please, tell me what's on your mind  
I can see the tears but I don't know why  
You're crying  
It it me or is it you  
  
Is it real or just a mood  
Well I know you're sad but what are you  
Tryin' to prove  
When you say that you can't go on  
  
And you feel like you don't belong  
You've got nobody to lean upon  
It seems we've come so far but we just can't  
Get along  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
  
I've been workin' -- never coming home at all  
I left you chained to the kitchen busy walkin'  
Up the wall  
Now I don't want nobody else  
  
And I'm not thinking about myself  
When I say that I'll do anything to stop you  
Saying that you don't belong  
And what we had is just upped and gone  
  
Please please try -- try to be strong  
Oh I apologize -- I didn't mean to lead you on  
Where did we go wrong  
Well you know there ain't nobody else  
  
I'd be a fool trying to please myself  
If I thought that there could be anybody else  
Well you'll see now as time goes on  
I'll be the one that you can lean upon  
  
We'll dry out the tears and never have to say  
That we were wrong  
Ooh babe we'll get it on
