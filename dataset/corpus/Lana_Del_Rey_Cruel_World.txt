[Intro]  
My body and my mind with you  
That's all over now  
Did what I had to do  
Cause it's so far past me now  
Share my body and my life with you  
That's way over now  
There's not more I can do  
You're so famous now  
  
[Verse 1]  
Got your bible  
Got your gun  
And you like to party  
And have fun  
And I like my candy  
And your women  
I'm finally happy  
Now that you're gone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Got my little red party dress on  
Everybody knows that I'm the best  
I'm crazy, yeah yeah  
Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya  
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free,  
You're dancing circles around me,  
You're fucking crazy,  
Ooh, ooh, you're crazy for me.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I share my body and my mind with you  
That's all over now  
I did what I had to do  
I found another anyhow  
Share my body and my mind with you  
That's all over now  
I did what I had to do  
I see you leaving now  
  
I got your bible,  
And your gun.  
And you love to party,  
And have fun.  
And I love your women,  
And I love your heroin  
And I'm so happy now that you're gone

Put my little red party dress on  
Everybody knows that I'm a mess,

Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya  
Go a little bit suburban and go crazy
