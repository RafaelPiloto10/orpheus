Chorus:  
Hip hop rules  
And if ya didn't know  
Hip hop rules  
Kick the ill flow  
Hip hop rules  
I'm breakin all the news  
Hip hop rules  
From the old to the new school  
Big black skinny nigga  
6'4" with the .44  
Got the slow flow it sound like coke dough  
In the Benzo smokin on Coco  
My blood niggas say I'm true Vatos loco  
For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal  
Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set  
Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex  
Shootin Tex at sets make a ho clits wet  
Now I cash big checks tryin to own assets  
Built like the Aztecs  
Why you niggas ass bet  
Remember Ice Ice Baby  
Drove you crazy then I was big as Jay-Z  
I got paid and I got swayze  
Eatin' shrimp with my feet up made me lazy  
I bought about 10 cars and about 5 cribs  
Out in the woods nobody knows where I live  
Got a beautiful wife and two kids  
But I'm married to hip hop and that's how it is  
Cause  
Chorus:  
Hip hop rules  
And if ya didn't know  
Hip hop rules  
Kick the ill flow  
Hip hop rules  
I'm breakin all the news  
Hip hop rules  
From the old to the new school  
It's been a long time since you seen me  
On the TV V-Ice is here for sheezy  
Takin' what's mine  
Cause it's my time to hit y'all with a new style of rhyme  
Yeah  
This is hip rock it can't be stopped  
Bomb tha system  
Straight to the top  
Millions of dollars I been spendin' em  
I love rap, I paved the way for Eminem  
Needless to say I rap back today  
Y'all forgot about me like y'all forgot about Dre  
But I'm still here  
With no fear I say what I want and make sure its clear  
Yo  
I play ball break jaws break all types of laws  
Militant haters wanna kill me with a cause  
Feel me  
I been nice since the P was free back when KRS was runnin shit  
Wit BDP  
I spit rapnology wack rappers follow me  
Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be  
Studying astronomy and the world's prophecy  
Giving sight to the blind enabling them to see  
It's me GOD equal 4 plus 3  
Coped a 6 with the V for the year 2G  
Stay blowin on trees, how many guns? 23  
But it only take one to make you history  
My clan hold me nobody control me  
So fuck a PO and being parolee  
I write solely light grey Roley  
Not the Bible but I lead a church of niggas Holy  
Because  
Chorus:  
Hip hop rules  
And if ya didn't know  
Hip hop rules  
Kick the ill flow  
Hip hop rules  
I'm breakin all the news  
Hip hop rules  
From the old to the new school  
I've got dawgs up north  
I've got dawgs down south  
I've got dawgs that'll smack blood out of your mouth  
Then lick they hand  
It's the Darkman brother number 12 from the Wu-Tang Clan  
You heard me on Gza you heard me on Deck  
That was me with ODB that bust a Tek  
La and Vanilla want money like Rockfeller  
If not I'll have to pop a fella  
I'm the illest Caucasian, rhymes blazin  
I went 17 platinum, amazin'  
Now just listen to the sound I kick  
Chillin with my man La, watchin gangsta flicks  
Don't ask why? I cheer for the bad guy  
Maybe it's the hydro, I'm so high  
Or maybe it's the Xtasy gettin the best of me  
The industry keeps on testin me  
But I won't fold I'm just too bold  
One thing about Ice I stay cold
