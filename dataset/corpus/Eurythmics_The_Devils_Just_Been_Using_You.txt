I heard you scratching on my back door  
I could smell what you come here for  
You brought your politics and glue  
And your phoney piece of paper too  
Yeah you'll be shaking in your shoes  
When I tell everybody the news  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
I saw you walking all alone  
Your face was hollow to the bone  
You were talking to St. John about a revolution  
That was the kind of trip you're on total destruction  
Yeah you'll be turning in your grave  
It's just no way to behave  
The devil's just been using you  
[Bridge:] after instrumental  
Yeah you'll be shivering inside  
When you realise  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you (repeat)  
(chant at end)  
Peace will never come into your life if you believe the  
Words he whispers in your mind it's just a piece of  
Conciousness that hangs around to let us know that  
Love is waiting to embrace us all
