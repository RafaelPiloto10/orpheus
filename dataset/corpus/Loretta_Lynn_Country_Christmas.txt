Mommie pop the popcorn and we string it on the tree  
Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel  
Daddy play the organ and we'll all sing Silent Night  
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright  
  
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be  
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree  
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight  
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright  
[ guitar ]  
Aunt Annie Belle will be here uncle Bill and darn our kids  
We'll make ballets on the floor just like we always did  
Grandma bake the pies and cakes oh what a pretty sight  
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright  
  
A good old country Christmas  
A good old country Christmas
