evil eyes  
stole my heart on a dark December night  
souls of flame  
loving her has made me half insane  
  
the way she cast me  
in her spell  
secrets I couldn't tell  
were for me  
and for you  
  
once I knew  
the joys of loving were for me and you  
but now she's here  
and with her secrets I know I'll have to bear  
  
to let her take me  
from your side  
rob me of all my pride  
and my love  
oh sweet love  
  
evil eyes  
she's got those  
evil eyes  
though I'm only her friend  
I know I'll love her till the end  
of my life  
oh sweet life  
  
evil eyes  
she's got those  
evil eyes  
though I'm only her friend  
I know I'll love her till the end  
of my life
