Many generation have passed away  
Fighting for the same cause, we fight for  
Today  
Now some people say when will it happen  
And that's what they say, now let us tell  
Them something  
  
My generation will make the change, wi  
Hafe bring it come  
This generation will make the change  
  
How could I dream that this will go on  
For more many years, until a kid become a  
Man  
Fighting for freedom, oh it's a deadly  
Thing  
And trying to get away from reality is  
Dangerous  
  
My generation will make the change, sing  
Along  
This generation will make the change  
Some man lose faith, too long ina the  
Struggle  
Oh no we can't lose faith, we born ina the  
Struggle  
Like they say we were born in sin, well  
Young blood ina the struggle  
  
Now is the time, no moe talk and play  
Now wake up lazy mind sleep for you  
Today  
Now youth responsible, when all else  
Have failed  
And there will be no more blaming  
Someone else  
  
My generation will make the change, I'm  
So glad to see  
This generation will make the change,  
Hard as it may be  
My generation will make the change, this  
Ain't no talk no cheap  
This generation will make the change  
This ain't no weep no weep  
  
My generation will make the change  
This generation will make the change  
My generation will make the change  
This generation will make the change  
My generation will make the change  
This generation will make the change
