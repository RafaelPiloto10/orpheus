Funny how the years  
They just pass us by  
Seems like yesterday  
You were in my life  
  
You always wanted  
To start a family  
I was way too young  
I was runnin' free  
  
If you could only see me now  
You'd realize  
I'm not the boy who  
Made you cry  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
I thought I knew it all  
How stupid could I be?  
I think of all I had  
And it makes me weak  
  
If you could only see me now  
You'd realize  
I'm not the boy who  
Made you cry  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
Sometimes  
You hurt the ones who love you most  
And sometimes  
You hold the ones who leave you lost  
And sometimes  
You learn but it's too late  
It's too late  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
  
You gave yourself  
Why did you give yourself to me?  
You died in me  
Why was I too blind to see?  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
Funny how the years  
Just pass us by
