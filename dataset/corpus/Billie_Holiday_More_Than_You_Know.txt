Whether you are here or yonder,  
Whether you are false or true  
Whether you remain or wander,  
I'm growing fonder of you  
Even though your friends forsake you,  
Even though you don't succeed  
Wouldn't I be glad to take you,  
Give you the break you need  
  
More than you know, more than you know  
Girl of my heart, I love you so  
Lately I find you're on my mind  
More than you know  
  
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong  
Girl of my heart, I'll string along  
You need me so  
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)  
Loving you the way that I do  
  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Loving may be all you can give  
But baby I can't live without it  
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry  
If you got tired and said "Good-bye"  
  
More than I'd show  
More than you'd ever know
