I've been down, I've been down too far to care  
I keep getting in my car but I'm not going anywhere  
And I've been had, well at least that's how it looks  
And it's not funny like on TV and it's not smart like it is in books  
And I wonder, yeah, I wonder how the world keeps spinnin' around  
Where's a boy with bad intentions gonna settle down?  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
I recall, when I was twenty-three  
Wondering how anyone could fall in love with me  
But now I'm old, hell, I'm well past twenty-five  
And I can't seem to fall in love no matter how I try  
And I wonder where I'll wind up but I'm headed west I know  
Wind my way through Texas and into New Mexico  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold
