(j. P. Maunick)  
  
You try to take things easy, but your mind out of control begins to wander  
Will there ever come a time, this searching and this waiting will be over  
  
See our love can come and go  
But there's something you should know  
  
Chorus:  
If you're looking for somebody  
Who will always be there for you  
Hold on (I'm the one)  
If you really need somebody  
Who will always take care of you  
Hold on (hold on to me)  
  
I was made to love you and the voices in my heart they keep me knowing  
You've got to give me time  
All I'm asking is the chance to prove my loving  
  
I got this feeling going on, taking hold of me so strong  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
I was made to love you, I know that much is true  
I was made to love (you)  
  
I got this feeling going on, taking hold of me so strong  
  
Chorus (fade)
