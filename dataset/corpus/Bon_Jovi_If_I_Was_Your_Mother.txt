If I was your mother  
Would you let me hold your hand  
Would you say you were my baby  
Would you always be my friend  
If I was your mother  
Could I teach you what's right  
Could I tell you stories, maybe tuck you in  
And kiss you sweet goodnight  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was your mother  
Would you always believe me  
'cause I'd wake up in the middle of the night  
Just to see if you need me  
Tell me there's no other  
To who you're telling secrets  
And would you tell me 'bout all the boys  
You been bringing home to meet me  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was your  
Tell me who I got to be  
To make you a part of me  
There's no one else you'll ever need  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
  
When love is blood you're never on trial  
It don't get deeper than a mother and child  
Oh, baby I got to get that close to you  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was yours  
Tell me who I got to be  
To make you a part of me  
There's no one else you'd ever need  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
Yeah  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
  
If I was your mother, mother [Repeat: x6]
