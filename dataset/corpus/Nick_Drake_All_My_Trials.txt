I had a little book  
Was give to me  
And every page  
Spoke of liberty  
  
All my trials  
Will soon be over  
  
There is a tree  
In paradise  
The pilgrims call it  
The tree of life  
  
All my trials  
Will soon be over  
  
But it's too late, my friend  
Too late  
But never mind  
  
All my trials  
Will soon be over  
  
If religion were a thing  
That money could buy  
Then the rich would live  
And the poor would die  
  
All my trials  
Will soon be over  
  
All my trials  
Will soon be over
