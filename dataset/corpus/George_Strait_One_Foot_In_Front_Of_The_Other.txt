Well, love can be an uphill climb  
I'm gonna meet a lot of resistance  
It takes every ounce of strength we've got  
If we're gonna go the distance  
We can get discouraged and lose our courage  
Worrying 'bout the daily grind  
But life's a journey, no need to hurry  
It's one day at a time  
  
[Chorus]  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step then take another  
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction  
Puttin' one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
What's down the road we can't say  
And the road behind don't matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
We're takin' it nice and slow  
Safe and sound, covering ground  
Steady as she goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow takes care of itself  
We'll just keep on keepin' on  
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet  
  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step and then take another  
Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction  
Just puttin' one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
Well, just a-hittin' our stride  
One foot in front of the other
