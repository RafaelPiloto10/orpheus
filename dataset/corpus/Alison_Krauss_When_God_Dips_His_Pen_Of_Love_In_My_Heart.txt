When God dips his pen of love in my heart  
And he writes my soul a message he wants me to know  
His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold  
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal  
I go to God in prayer, I can always find him there  
To whisper sweet peace to my soul  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way  
And gave his life completely to bring a better day  
My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in  
His blood washed away every stain  
  
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
He made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart
