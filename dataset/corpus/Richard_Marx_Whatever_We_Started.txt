Hang up the phone, I'm alone  
I'll unlock the door  
Slip in, let all your clothes just fall  
Off you to the floor  
Don't even make a sound or turn your mind around  
There is only now... For me and you  
  
We can't stop whatever we started  
Can't resist what's meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
Let's do it now, don't think  
Look in my eyes and don't blink  
We can't stop whatever we started  
  
Come over and I'll put my hands where I want to  
End of the bed with my scent  
Still left on you  
Baby don't pretend,  
Could ever just be friends  
After I have been... Inside of you  
  
We can't stop whatever we started  
Can't resist what's meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
Let's do it now and don't think  
Look in my eyes and don't blink  
We can't stop whatever we started  
  
Hang up the phone  
I'm all alone  
I'll unlock the door...  
  
We can't stop whatever we started  
Can't resist what's meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
(All over)  
Let's do it now and don't think  
Look in my eyes and don't blink  
(And don't... And don't)  
We can't stop whatever we started
