In the nights of lost and found  
Many strangers are around  
You're nobody until someone will love you  
You can't make it on your own  
When you standing there alone  
Many heartaches keep the world on turning  
'Cause you are fooled by your feeling  
You can pay the price of love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
You're undercover, yeah tonight  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
Romantic warrior, yeah tonight  
  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your love  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your heart  
We're fighting for your love  
  
Legends have a broken heart  
There's someone who tore apart  
Oh, there must be more to life than this, babe  
Idol love can't last through years  
How can love, babe, last through years ?  
You're surrounded, baby, oh by strangers  
Come let me be your hero  
And I'm fighting for your love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart
