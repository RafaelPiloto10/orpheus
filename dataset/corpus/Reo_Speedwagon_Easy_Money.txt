South of the border and busted,  
Caught by a woman I trusted,  
Now don't you call me a fool,  
It could have happened to you,  
It's just my luck,  
It had to happen to me.  
  
Sweet Carmelita betrayed me  
She said, "Take me home, serenade me."  
I figured a song could do me no wrong.  
I didn't know how wrong I could be.  
  
Easy money for just one run to Peru.  
It'll be so easy. We'll have no trouble gettin' through.  
Well I almost made it, except for that one border guard.  
He opened up my guitar. Hello prison yard.  
Goodbye easy money. Easy money.  
  
The chiquita must have told 'em my story  
'Cause when my eyes finally focused next morning  
Carmelita had spoken 'bout guitars and some coke  
And she laughed as they slapped me in chains.  
  
I was thrown in cell with a killer.  
A convict who coughed through the night.  
While I laid awake with the chills and shakes,  
Hoping for a file in a cake.  
  
Easy money for just one run to Peru.  
It'll be so easy. We'll have no trouble gettin' through.  
Well I almost made it, except for that one border guard.  
He opened up my guitar. Hello prison yard.  
Just to make me mad he smashed my guitar.  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Easy money
