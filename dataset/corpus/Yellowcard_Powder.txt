Lying soaked in sweat tonight,  
Your knuckles white,  
you try to fight,  
The need for more to get you by,  
You've had enough,  
You wonder why,  
Even now your body cries,  
For chemicals to blind your eyes,  
Wonder can you stay this high,  
When the cells begin to die  
Forever, Forever, Forever,  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, Smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
Swallowed like the medicine,  
That's broken down my happy friend,  
Wonder if he'll let me in,  
When I come to see him when,  
He's Better, Better, Better,  
No  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
There's power,  
In the powder,  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
There's power,  
In the powder,  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
(I'm Falling) Crush it up, crush it up,  
(I'm Falling) Take it down, take it down,  
(I'm Falling) Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
(I'm Falling) Crush it up, crush it up,  
(I'm Falling) Take it down, take it down,  
(I'm Falling) Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
Falling,  
I'm falling,  
I'm falling,  
I'm falling down
