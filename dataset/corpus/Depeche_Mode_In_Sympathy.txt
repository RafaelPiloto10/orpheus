They're almost falling over you  
Why don't they call a truce  
What ever they are trying to do  
It's of little use  
They're drowning you in compliments  
Trying to furnish proof  
And though they speak with eloquence  
There is little truth  
  
[Chorus]  
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy  
  
I'm watching your serenity  
The way your soul transcends  
Their tedious obscenities  
You're patience never ends  
  
And as the night begins to fade  
You are heading for the door  
Followed by a sad parade  
You're on your own once more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy
