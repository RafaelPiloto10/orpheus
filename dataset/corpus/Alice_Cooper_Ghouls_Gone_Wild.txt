We're gonna have a bash and we're glad you finally got here  
'Cause we're already trashed and the band is really hot, yeah  
We're gonna dance our heads off and we're gonna keep it tight  
If we keep ourselves together, we might make it through the night  
  
Ghouls gone wild, wilder than before  
We had a little taste and now we need a little more  
Ghouls gone wild, screamin' in the night  
We're feelin' kinda hungry and we came in for a bite  
  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
  
We're gonna raise some hell, yeah, we're gonna rock and roll here  
And the sulfur that you smell, well, it adds a little soul there  
We're dancin' on your grave and we're dancin' in the street  
We're dancin' through the fire and it's burnin' up our feet  
(Burnin' up our feet)  
  
Ghouls gone wild  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
Wilder than before  
(Wilder than before)  
We had a little taste  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
And now we need a little more  
(Need a little more)  
Ghouls gone wild  
  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
Screamin' in the night  
(Screamin' in the night)  
We're feelin' kinda hungry  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
And we came in for a bite  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
  
So exciting  
(So delicious, so delicious, so delicious, so suspicious)  
When we're biting  
(So delicious, so delicious, so delicious, so suspicious)  
Come on and play  
What do ya say?  
  
Ghouls gone wild  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
Wilder than before  
(Wilder than before)  
We had a little taste  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
And now we need a little more  
(Need a little more)  
Ghouls gone wild  
  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
Screamin' in the night  
(Screamin' in the night)  
We're feelin' kinda hungry  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
And we came in for a bite  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
  
Ghouls  
Ghouls  
Ghouls
