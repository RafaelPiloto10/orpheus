I'm afraid to fly  
And I don't know why  
I'm jealous of the people who  
Are not afraid to die  
It's just that I recall  
Back when I was small  
Someone promised that they'd catch  
But then they'd let me fall  
  
And now I'm fallin'  
Fallin' fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
  
You think, by now I've learned  
Play with fire, you'd get burned  
But fire can be oh so warm  
And that's why I return  
Turn and walk away  
That's what I should do  
My head says go and find the door  
My heart says I'll find you  
  
And now I'm fallin'  
Catch me if you can  
Maybe this time I'll have it all  
When I fall in love  
  
(It always turns out the same)  
(Loving someone) Loving someone (Losing myself)  
I only got me to blame  
  
Help me, I'm fallin'  
Fallin', catch me if you can  
Maybe this time I'll have it all  
Maybe I'll make it afterall  
Maybe this time I won't fall  
When I fall in love
