Sinking my teeth  
into you  
Sweet obscenity  
You're in too deep  
for your own good  
  
I'm commanding thee  
Succumb to me  
set me free  
  
Facing the animal  
Walking the higher ground  
Lost in a ritual  
I close your eyes  
and kiss you twice  
  
Facing the Animal  
  
The scent of your skin  
Overpowers me  
there is no remedy  
It comes from within  
the divinity  
I just can't resist  
Must admit  
I'm losing it  
  
Facing the animal  
  
Facing the animal, yeah  
Lost in a ritual
