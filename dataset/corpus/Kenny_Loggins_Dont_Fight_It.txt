Live long enough you're bound to find  
Moonshine'll make a man go blind  
Never can tell what the brew will do  
But there's times you'll wind up feelin so fine  
  
Some women seem to have a knack  
They'll turn you on and leave you flat  
Never can tell who's playin for keeps  
So tell me now what's holding you back  
I know your heart can take it  
  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
It'll do your heart so good  
  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
It'll only do you good  
  
Don't fight it'll do your heart so good  
do what mama do  
Do what daddy do  
When you gonna make up your mind  
You can run but love will find you  
Ready or not here it comes  
  
Some people when they hear a groove  
Shake their heads cause they just can't approve  
Well I turn up the music till it's shakin the sky  
Is everybody ready to move  
  
There's times you want to shake yourself  
There's nights you want to yell for help  
You can fly when you're standing still  
N there's nothing wrong with raising some hell  
Tonight we're gonna raise it  
  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it'll do your heart so good  
  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it  
Don't fight it
