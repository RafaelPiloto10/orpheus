Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Someday soon  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then we'll  
Have to motor through somehow  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Once again  
As in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Someday soon  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
So hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now
