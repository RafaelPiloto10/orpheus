I'll catch a moonbeam to make you a gown  
Snowflakes to wear in your hair like a crown  
And you'll wear them well  
Noelle, Noelle  
  
Rainbows will make you a ring for your hand  
Stardust will carpet your own wonderland  
There you'll always dwell  
Noelle, Noelle  
  
You're the smallest miracle  
That I will ever see  
But you're the greatest thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
Angels will whisper to bring you a breeze  
I'll make you music from their melodies  
This I can foretell  
For you, for you  
Noelle
