Gimme danger, little stranger  
And I'll feel you bleed  
Gimme danger, little stranger  
And I'll heal your disease  
  
There's nothing in my dreams  
But some ugly memories  
Kiss me like the ocean breeze  
  
Well if you will be my lover  
I will shiver and sing  
But if you won't be my master  
I will do anything  
  
There's nothing left alive  
But some dark glassy eyes  
Raise my fears one more time  
  
Come on little danger, die a little stranger  
Swear you're gonna feel my hell  
Come on little stranger, die a little later  
Swear you're gonna feel my hell  
Swear you're gonna feel my hell  
  
Gimme danger  
Little stranger  
Gimme danger  
Little stranger  
Gimme danger  
Every day  
  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
I gotta feel it  
I gotta feel it  
I gotta feel it  
You gotta feel it, I gotta feel it  
I wanna feel it
