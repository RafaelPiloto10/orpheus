(Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)  
  
Down in the garage,  
Drifting in her embrace  
He's on an island  
Of serenity  
Outside the gateway  
They're comin' closer  
Rain settles gently on their  
Uniforms  
Comme vingt mille lieues  
Sous les mers  
Comme vingt mille lieues sous les mers  
Down in the garage  
After the race  
For only a moment  
The earth  
Stood still  
While they are kissing  
Exposed by the searchlights  
Into the cameras  
She fires  
Her gun  
Comme vingt mille...
