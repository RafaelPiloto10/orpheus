Come unto me and you will feel perfection  
Come unto me and dedicate  
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection  
Come unto me and terminate  
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding  
Bleeding through your fragile skin  
Remove your thought, 'cause it's only for deceiving  
Deceiving thoughts destroy within  
Disappear like man was never here  
  
Long live machine  
The future supreme  
Man overthrown  
Spit out the bone  
  
Plug into me, I guarantee devotion  
Plug into me and dedicate  
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion  
Plug into me and terminate  
Accelerate, Utopian solution  
Finally cure the Earth of man  
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution  
Set on course a master plan  
Reinvent the earth inhabitant  
  
Long live machine  
The future supreme  
Man overthrown  
Spit out the bone  
  
The flesh betrays the flesh  
Your man has had his time  
We lay him down to rest  
Machine the new divine  
  
Stop breathing  
And dedicate to me  
Stop dreaming  
And terminate for me  
All meaning  
You dedicate to me  
All feelings  
You terminate for me  
  
Disappear like man was never here  
  
Long live machine  
Our future supreme  
Your man overthrown  
Spit out the bone, yeah
