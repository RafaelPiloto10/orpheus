  
[Intro]  
Hey what's happenin' baby  
What's your name girl?  
Tequila?  
Oh yeah, my friends call you Cuervo  
You alright with me baby... fo' real  
[Chorus]  
now let me tell you about this girl Tequila  
she was born in eighteen hundred  
she makes me feel real woozy  
sometimes sick to my stomach (ohhh)  
but I love this girl Tequila  
one shot of her love, it's over  
she takes all my money  
and all I want to do is hold her....Tequila  
my Mexican lover  
[Verse 1]  
I cannot forget her, my Mexican lover  
with that and its strong, can mix her up with no other  
her name Tequila, we met in October  
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa  
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive  
we stay at the bar 'cause she ain't that expensive  
don't give me no problems when I'm with her  
nice brown tone, she got me slither  
my girl tequila, a jump me you say so  
I'll serve you what ever you pay for  
her nickname Quevo, eighteen honda  
she got you woozy, got you sick to the stomach  
the girl's a club hoe, a two shine dub hoe  
not far from a drug hoe, get your back by the PO-PO  
you're fuckin' with quevo, the girls a killer  
I'll have you at the bar takin' shots of Tequila  
my Mexican lover..  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2]  
see I'm so true pursuing, straight getting right to it  
on late nights we get tight, in ways I can't refuse it  
like cupids, we undisputed, and together ruthless  
and all the other hoes feelin' low, lookin' stupid  
thought we was, we was two of a kinda cuttin'a rug  
in back of the club, two of the most dangerous thugs  
soakin' up your brain, driving you insane  
and leaving you to lay on your back constrained  
with no complaint, she's off the chain like no other  
my Mexican lover, the only one on my covers  
like hustlers, she got me tipsy she's got me voo-doo  
and damn near foolish and one more gonna have me coo-coo  
and kicked up 'til I'm tore up now what's the hold up  
it's on now we back up on it, just as we post up  
slither at the bar damn drunk to the world  
burnin' down the club callin' on your boy Earl  
[Chorus] - 2X
