When shit gets hard  
Ima protect you  
  
Now a days seems like death is the way  
It's like the value of life goes down every day  
They pushin rocks in this park  
Where your children play  
But ima be right here

When it's cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh

With everything that I  
  
You can't tell where the darkness begins or it ends  
You can't trust yourself let alone your friends  
Got the devil at your door  
And he wana get in  
But ima be that one  
On which you can depend  
Singin

And we'll have a blast  
But ima stay right here  
Devoted instead of pass

When it's cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh  
Ima protect you  
With everything that I  
  
Tryna pull your arm down and give you the blues  
You see that every damn day and every night in the news  
The whole damn world  
Has got issues  
But through the storm and the rain  
Ima be there for you  
Singin  
  
Ooooooooooohhh

When it's cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh
