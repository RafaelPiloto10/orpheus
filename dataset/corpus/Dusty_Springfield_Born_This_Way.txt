Some people know what they want to be  
Some people see what they want to see  
Everyday needs some kind of dream  
But the complexities of life escape to an ideal scene, yeah  
  
People try to tell you how to live your life  
Let the blind lead the blind  
Well, that's all right  
So make up your mind  
The fool or the wise  
There are things in this life  
Which you can't compromise  
  
Break away  
And take the time to know your mind  
And leave it all behind you  
And say  
That's the way I am  
  
Yeah I was born this way  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
Yeah, heah, heah  
Oh, I was born this way  
Can't you feel it in your heart  
Yeah, heah, heah, oh  
  
It's not always easy to disagree  
Don't make excuses for what you see  
There's one thing in life  
I have no doubt  
You're on the way up  
On the way out, baby, oh  
  
Some people see what's gonna be  
But they hide in a corner  
From reality  
Sometimes you're up  
And sometimes you're down  
You can't spend your whole life  
Just fooling around  
  
Break away  
And take the time to break the ties  
And leave it all behind you and say  
That's the way I am  
  
Yeah I was born this way  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
Yeah, heah, heah  
Oh, I was born this way  
Can't you feel it in your heart and say  
Yeah, heah, heah, oh  
  
In this world  
There's a love that's unspoken  
Letting go  
Reaching out  
Then it's time to search your heart  
And stop, it's you  
Learn to love yourself  
Respect yourself  
Say that's the way I am  
  
Say, I was born this way  
Yeah, yeah, why
