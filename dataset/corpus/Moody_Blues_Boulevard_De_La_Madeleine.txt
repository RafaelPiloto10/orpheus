She said she'd come, she didn't  
I'm the one in love, she isn't  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
It's a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldn't be there  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
Oh, I wish I knew her better  
It's not easy to forget her  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
It's a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldn't be there  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine
