Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze  
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please  
Well it's all right, doing the best you can  
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand  
  
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring  
Waiting for someone to tell you everything  
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring  
Maybe a diamond ring  
  
Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong  
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong  
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay  
Well it's all right, everyday is judgment day  
  
Maybe somewhere down the road aways  
You'll think of me, wonder where i am these days  
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays  
Purple haze  
  
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove  
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love  
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine  
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line  
  
Don't have to be ashamed of the car i drive  
I'm glad to be here, happy to be alive  
It don't matter if you're by my side  
I'm satisfied  
  
Well it's all right, even if you're old and gray  
Well it's all right, you still got something to say  
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live  
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive  
  
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze  
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please  
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine  
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
