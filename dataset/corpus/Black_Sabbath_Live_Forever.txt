Just before you die  
They say you see your life go flashing by  
Cold dark endless nights  
To burn in hell or bathe in ever light  
  
Well I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't want to die  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
I live inside a lie  
  
Days pass by too soon  
Waiting for the rising of the moon  
No escape from here  
Facing death but is your conscious clear?  
  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
Watching my life go by  
And I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't wanna die  
  
Well I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't want to die  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
I live inside a lie  
  
Don't want to life forever  
But I don't want to die  
Don't want to life forever  
But I don't want to die
