They say the time has come for us  
To start again  
I believe that's true  
They say the time has come for us  
  
To make amends  
And I believe that too  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world  
Where children are laughing  
Lovers romancing  
  
Time stands still  
A perfect world  
There's nothing to cry for  
No one to die for  
  
Wonderful  
In a perfect world  
Our father's father says that  
Things were better then  
  
How easy they forgot  
On every page in every book of history  
A thousand tears were shed  
There's hope in our hearts  
  
And love in our eyes  
Day after day I keep searching  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world,  
Show me the way I'm to understand  
That you prove to myself that I'm a man  
  
And you love, but you can't look from above  
Travel cross the seven seas to be with you  
Passion and desire will see me through  
The road that I must travel will wind and curl  
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world
