Bending the rules of a late night card game  
Where the loser removes an item of clothing  
Your treading each deal, so eargings and grey  
Have a shufty over your shoulder well it's a shady game  
And I want to lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Its nothing to you  
Its nothing to you  
  
This re-shuffled pack brings back the sickness of luck,  
Because the ace in my hand is such a shock,  
Exchanging queen for your two while you're out of the room,  
Have a shufty over your shoulder, well all the same it's a shady game  
And I want to lose  
Oh, please let me lose  
Oh, please let me lose  
It's nothing to you  
It's nothing to you  
  
I'm cutting this queen  
Well, this six is chewed  
You're all un-disguised  
I'm stuck on shoes  
So, have you ever met a bad winner?  
"Well, how do you do"  
Jack ace queen king no na no na no na no na  
Noooooo  
Nooooo  
Nooooooooooooaooooohohoh  
They wont let me lose  
  
I'm bending the rules of a late night card game. .  
Ha ha ha
