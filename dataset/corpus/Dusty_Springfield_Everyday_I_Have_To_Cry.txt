Everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
There was a little boy I had planned to marry  
This was my love I didn't want to share it  
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny  
He said he couldn't love me 'cause he didn't have no money  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
I got me a boy  
I guess I really loved him  
Every night now I was thinking of him  
But you can't mix love with money  
'cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Although I know that he's just a poor boy  
Is it wrong to love 'cause he's not a rich boy?  
Every time you mix love with money  
Every time you hurt somebody  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Everyday I have to cry  
Everyday I have to cry  
Oh, oh
