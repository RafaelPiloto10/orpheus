Use a weapon of words  
  
Or a fight with your fists  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
Stand your ground and persist  
And be the last one to blink  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will  
  
The black peat of the hills  
When I was still ill  
See this mess and forgive someone  
  
And then recall if you can  
How all this even began  
Forgive someone  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will  
  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me  
  
Shorts and supports and faulty shower heads  
At track and field we dreamt of our beds  
In the bleachers you sit with your legs spread, smiling  
"Here's one thing you'll never have"  
  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me
