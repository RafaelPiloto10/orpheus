Down the line, don't go over  
There's a limit, you went over  
So much time, time runs out  
Time ran out, make it down  
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?  
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Downed the line, couldn't get much  
Couldn't get much, higher if you tried  
And tried and tried, you're as guilty  
It's the crime, oh, oh, it's a crime  
  
You can never come down, you can never come down  
You can never come down, you can never come down  
Down inside-you're getting nervous  
You've never been this high before, oh no
