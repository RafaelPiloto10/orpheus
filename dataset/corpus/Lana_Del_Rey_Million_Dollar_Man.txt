You said I was the most exotic flower  
Holding me close in our final hour  
  
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy  
I don't know what you do, but you're unbelievable  
I don't know how you get over, get over  
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you  
  
One for the money and two for the show  
I love you honey, I'm ready I'm ready to go  
How did you get that way? I don't know  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?  
  
You got that world but baby at what price  
Something so strange, and it's hard to define  
  
It isn't that hard boy, to like you or even love you  
I will follow you down down down,  
you're unbelievable  
if you're going crazy just grab me and take me  
I would follow you down down down, like anywhere anywhere  
  
[Repeat x2]  
One for the money, two for the show  
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go  
How did you get that way? I don't know  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?  
  
I don't know,  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?
