She would never say where she came from  
And yesterday don't matter if it's gone  
When the sun is bright  
Or on the darkest night  
No one knows, she comes and goes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
No question why she needs to be so free  
She'll tell you it's the only way to be  
She just can't be chained  
To a life where nothing's gained  
And nothing's lost, at such a cost  
  
[Chorus]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
There's no time to lose I heard her say  
Cast your dreams before they slip away  
Tired all the time  
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind  
Ain't life unkind  
  
[Chorus x4]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you
