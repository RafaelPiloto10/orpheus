Gonna leave the pain behind  
Gonna leave the fools in line  
Gonna take the magic potion  
Gettin' in an old black car  
Gonna take a ride so far  
To the land of sun tan lotion  
Gonna take it state by state  
Til I hit the golden gate  
Get my feet wet in the ocean  
  
I'm still living  
In the dream we had,  
For me it's not over...  
  
Walkin on the bridge on day  
Lookin out across the bay  
I saw a rippling in the water  
Once a big ship had passed  
I borrowed a traveller's glass  
And focused on  
The ocean's daughter  
Kind of like a wave confused  
Dancing in the sunset hews  
She waved to me  
And called me over  
  
I'm still living  
In the dream we had,  
For me it's not over...  
  
Talkin' bout a friend of mine  
Talkin' bout a gold mine  
Richest vein in any mountain  
Talkin' bout the enemy  
Inside of me  
Talkin' bout  
That youthful fountain  
Talkin' bout you and me  
Talkin' bout eternity  
Talkin' bout the big time  
  
I'm still living  
In the dream we had,  
For me it's not over...
