So young so strong  
Ignorance is bliss  
Thin skin caught up again  
In a place like this  
  
Big people set the trap for you  
Using you-know-what for brains  
You're just another lab experiment  
And you're easy to replace  
  
Too much too soon  
Sensors overload  
Brought down, chased out of town  
Another dangerous road  
  
Simply a problem of biology  
It's a choice you never make  
The scene is set and you're subjected to  
A lethal dose of growing pains  
  
Think it through  
Logic must be made for fools  
Leave them now  
And be a has-been who never was  
They'll set you up with pains that grow
