Broken hearted and so sad, golden curls all wet with tears,  
'Twas a picture of sorrow to see.  
Kneeling close to the side of his pal and only pride,  
A little lad these words he told me.  
  
He was such a lovely doggie and to me he was such fun,  
but today as we played by the way  
A drunken man got mad at him because he barked in joy,  
He beat him and he's dying here today.  
  
Will you call the doctor please and tell him if he comes right now,  
he'll save my precious doggie 'cause I'll pray.  
Then he stroked the fluffy head but his little pal was dead,  
Just a shiver and he slowly passed away.  
  
He didn't know his dog had died, so I told him as he cried  
"Come with me son we'll get that doctor right away"  
"But I can't leave him here alone, I must get my doggie home  
So while you're gone I'll kneel beside him, sir and I'll pray."  
  
But when I returned he had his little pal upon his knee  
And the teardrops they were blinding his big blue eyes,  
"You're too late, sir my doggie's dead and no help can save him now  
But I'll meet my precious Buddy up in the sky."  
  
By a tiny narrow grave, where the willows sadly wave,  
are these words on a shingle of pine:  
"Little Buddy rest in peace, God will watch you through' the years,  
Cause I told Him in my prayers that you were mine."
