The moon was shining on the lake at night  
The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right  
Smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes, I saw a light  
  
You told me stories about your chickadees  
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery  
You charmed the lifeguard, to let them use the pool all day for free  
  
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet  
I was next to you and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night  
  
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had  
We watched Titanic, and it didn't make us sad  
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad  
  
Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat  
I dug you so much, I took some for the team  
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV  
  
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring  
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want
you to)  
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue  
Girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night  
  
So much pain may come our way  
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say  
When the conversation stops, and we're facing our defeat  
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me  
  
Then I'll say girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want
you to)  
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue  
Girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night
