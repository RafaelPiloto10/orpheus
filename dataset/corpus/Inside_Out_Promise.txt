When you need a friend,  
Don't look to a stranger.  
You know in the end,  
I'll always be there.  
And when you're in doubt,  
Or when you're in danger,  
Take a look all around.  
I'll be there.  
I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.  
I know they don't sound the way they I planned them to be.  
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me.  
I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
When your day is though,  
And so is your temper,  
You know what to do.  
I'll always be there.  
Sometimes if I shout,  
It's not what's intended,  
These words just come out.  
With no cross to bear.  
I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.  
I know they don't sound the way they I planned them to be.  
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me.  
I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
I gotta tell ya. I gotta tell ya. I gotta tell ya. I gotta tell ya.  
I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.  
I know they don't sound the way they I planned them to be.  
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me.  
I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.  
I know they don't sound the way they I planned them to be.  
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me.  
I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
I will. I will. I will. I will.
