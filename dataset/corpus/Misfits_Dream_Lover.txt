Every night I hope and pray a dream lover will come my way  
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms  
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah) a girl (yeah-yeah yeah) to call (yeah-yeah
yeah) my  
own (yeah-yeah)  
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone  
  
Dream lover, where are you with a love, oh, so true?  
And I hand that can hold, to feel you near as I grow old?  
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah) a girl (yeah-yeah yeah) to call (yeah-yeah
yeah) my  
own (yeah-yeah)  
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone  
  
Someday, I don't know how, I hope she'll hear my plea  
Some way, I don't know how, she'll bring her love to me  
  
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again  
That's the only thing to do, till all my lover's dreams come true  
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah) a girl (yeah-yeah yeah) to call (yeah-yeah
yeah) my  
own (yeah-yeah)  
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone  
  
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again  
That's the only thing to do, till all my lover's dreams come true  
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah) a girl (yeah-yeah yeah) to call (yeah-yeah
yeah) my  
own (yeah-yeah)  
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone  
  
Please don't make me dream alone  
I beg you don't make me dream alone  
  
Don't make me dream alone  
Don't make me dream alone
