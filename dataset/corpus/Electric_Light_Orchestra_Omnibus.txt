There she is I'm sure I seen her  
Pushing in the queue to get to the front  
Join the ladies in my dream  
I know that nothing hurts you babe  
In my balance in a way  
  
Chorus  
  
Come and take a ride on my omnibus  
We could take you right to the terminus  
Don't forget your ticket if you want to ride  
(catching a ride)  
If you want to go inside  
  
Just a dud their hansom falter [?]  
Harem on a bus flies over the top  
... Jeans  
Lock up your daughters  
  
Just too late to save the day  
Ring my bell and turn away  
  
Chorus  
  
Sweet silver meadows  
Protect us from the rain  
Please never break  
Take us to the stars again  
Hear the ways for every where  
See my sleighs win the air  
  
Save the girls upstairs for later  
Now you wonder if I can manage them all  
Wrap them up in christmas paper  
Tell them they don't have to pay  
Ring my bell and turn away  
  
Chorus  
  
Omnibus ride  
Omnibus ride
