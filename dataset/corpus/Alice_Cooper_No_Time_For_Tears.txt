No time for tears  
Stars don't have time to cry  
No time for tears  
He's just another guy  
Who used your heart  
But don' forget who you are  
  
You're playing the part  
The greatest movie star  
So soul aches  
You think it's  
The end of it all  
  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
That's all  
Yeah tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
That's all  
  
Your soul aches  
You cry out  
You're weeping  
You're while  
  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes  
Yeah tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes?  
Yeah tears always dry  
All of us lie  
Sometimes?  
Only sometimes
