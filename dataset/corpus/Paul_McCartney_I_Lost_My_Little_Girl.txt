WELL, I WOKE UP LATE THIS MORNING,  
MY HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL,  
ONLY WHEN I REALISED I LOST MY LITTLE GIRL.  
AH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH.  
  
WELL, HER CLOTHES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE,  
HER HAIR DIDN'T ALWAYS CURL.  
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE HER  
BUT I LOVE MY LITTLE GIRL.  
AH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH.  
  
WELL, GATHER 'ROUND PEOPLE,  
LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY  
OF THE VERY FIRST SONG I WROTE.
