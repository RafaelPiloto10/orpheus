Every now and then you like to take it easy  
Sit right back and view the situation  
The future is brighter  
Soon we'll be riding on the crest of a wave  
  
[Chorus]  
Good-bye to all your troubles  
Change of heart, the world will start today  
It's like a new beginning  
See it shining like a brand new star  
  
Well, if you're thinking that you'll end up crying  
Maybe all you need is to get away from friends  
And the walls around you  
Find a shore, step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new star  
  
I won't be a burden upon your shoulder  
I will give you wings so you can fly  
To lands where you're dreams surround you  
Find a shore and step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new star  
Like a brand new star
