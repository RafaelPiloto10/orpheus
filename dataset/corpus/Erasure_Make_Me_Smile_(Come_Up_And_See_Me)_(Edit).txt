"You've done it all  
You've broken every code  
And pulled the rebel to the floor  
You've spoilt the game  
No matter what you say  
For only metal, what a bore  
Blue eyes, blue eyes  
How can you tell so many lies?  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There's nothing left  
All is gone and run away  
Maybe you'll tarry for a while  
It's just a test  
A game for us to play  
Win or lose, it's hard to smile  
Resist, resist  
It's from yourself you'll have to hide  
Come up and see me to make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There ain't no more  
You've taken everything  
From my belief in Mother Earth  
Can you ignore my faith in everything?  
'Cos I know what faith is  
And what it's worth  
Away, away  
And don't say maybe you'll try  
To come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, just running wild"  
Repeat to fade
