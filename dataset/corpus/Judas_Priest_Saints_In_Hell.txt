They laughed at their god  
And fought him in vain  
So he turned his back on them  
And left them in pain  
Now here come the saints  
With their banners held high  
Each one of them martyrs  
Quite willing to die  
Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell  
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell  
Cover your fists  
Razor your spears  
It's been our possession  
For eight thousand years  
Fetch the scream eagles  
Unleash the wild cats  
Set loose the king cobras  
And blood sucking bats  
Wake the dead, the saints are in hell  
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell  
We are saints  
In hell  
We are saints  
In hell  
We're going down  
Into the fire  
We're going down  
Into the fire  
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation  
As carnage took toll for the bell  
Abattoir, abattoir, mon  
Dieu quelle horreur  
For a time is was like second hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
The battle is over, the saints are alive  
How can we all thank you, we felt so despised  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell
