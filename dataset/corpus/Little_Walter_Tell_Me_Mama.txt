Oh, tell me mama  
Who's that while ago?  
Oh, tell me mama  
Who's that while ago?  
Yes, when I come in  
Who went out that back door?  
Now don't come here mama  
I'm gonna start a ragin' stand  
You been out boogie-woogie'n  
There's somethin' I don't understand  
I want you to tell me mama  
Who's that while ago?  
Yes, when I come in  
Who went out that back door?  
Now this is somethin'  
I never seen before  
A man is gettin' my money  
Always slammin' my back door  
I want you to tell me mama  
Who's that while ago?  
Yes, when I came in  
Who went out that back door?  
Oh, I had to wanna kneel down  
You couldn't give the truth  
His hat in his hand  
And his overcoat too  
I want you to tell me mama  
Why can't you be true?  
Yes, when I came in  
Who went out that back door?  
He came by me runnin'  
Smellin' like a whiskey can  
My hat in his hand  
And my overcoat too  
I want you to tell me mama  
Who's that while ago?  
Yes, when I came in  
Who went out that back door?
