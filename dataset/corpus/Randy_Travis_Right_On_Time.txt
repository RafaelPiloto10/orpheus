It's not my nature to be patient  
I jump every river I cross  
Not one for following the sensible side  
And I can't count the times I've been lost.  
  
Well, you can't see where you're goin' in the pourin' rain  
When you're runnin' into walls and feeling no pain  
We've all done time with the devil and I've done mine  
It took a while to get here but, I'm right on time.  
  
I may still regret some moments  
But it's just part of a right  
I count myself among the fortunate ones  
Who made it to the other side.  
  
Well, you go what you go through to get where you are  
Lucky for me I didn't go too far  
I turned around before the end of the line  
Took a while to get here but, I'm right on time.  
  
Well, you can't see where you're goin' in the pourin' rain  
When you're runnin' into walls and feeling no pain  
We've all done time with the devil and I've done mine  
It took a while to get here but, I'm right on time.
