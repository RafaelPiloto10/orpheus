I can't stop talking bout  
The things that You have done  
My life has changed because  
You gave Your only Son  
  
You helped my feet to stand  
When all is sinking sand  
And when my world collapsed  
You hold me in Your hand  
  
And all my crash and burn  
Collided with You Great and Mighty One  
So here I am  
I stand with my life in my hands  
I give You all  
  
I can't stop singing bout  
The way You changed my life  
From all the foolishness  
I crashed into my life  
  
You helped my feet to stand  
When all is sinking sand  
And when my world collapsed  
You hold me in Your hand
