Why do I try to win the love  
That I've already wooed and won  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause he likes to roll he likes to roll  
He likes to roll he likes to roll  
He takes the flower from his button hole  
When he likes to roll, he likes to roll  
I tend to lose my self control  
When he likes to roll, he likes to roll  
  
Here in this little sunny bay  
Once a day he comes and goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He likes to roll...  
  
The moon is down but the odds are high  
That seeming me, he won't pass me by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He likes to roll...
