Daylight saved  
Daylight saved  
To spite the dark  
In spite of the darkness  
There I'll crave  
There I'll crave  
To get to the heart  
In spite of the darkness  
  
Great wide stretches of canvas  
Signed by a godless name  
Strange bright colors of madness  
Only a fool would frame  
Sketches of pain  
Sketches of pain  
Sketches of pain  
  
Some cry shame  
Some cry shame  
We tore them apart  
We failed to imagine  
God might claim  
God might claim  
The works of art  
We failed to imagine  
  
Great wide stretches of canvas  
Signed by a godless name  
Strange bright colors of madness  
Only a fool would frame  
Sketches of pain [Repeat: x6]
