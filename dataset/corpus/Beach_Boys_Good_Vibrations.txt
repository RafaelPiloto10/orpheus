I, I love the colorful clothes she wears  
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair  
I hear the sound of a gentle word  
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air  
  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations  
She's giving me excitations  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
  
Close my eyes  
She's somehow closer now  
Softly smile, I know she must be kind  
When I look in her eyes  
She goes with me to a blossom world  
  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations  
She's giving me excitations  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
  
(Ah)  
(Ah my my what elation)  
I don't know where but she sends me there  
(Ah my, my, what a sensation)  
(Ah my, my, what elations)  
(Ah my, my, what)  
  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin' with her  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin' with her  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin'  
  
Ah  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, I'm pickin' up good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na  
Do, do, do, do, do,  
Do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do, do,  
Do, do, do
