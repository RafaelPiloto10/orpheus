Oh, please.  
Lend your little ear to my pleas  
Lend a ray of cheer to my pleas  
Tell me that you love me too.  
Please  
Let me hold you tight in my arms  
I could find delight in your charms  
Every night my whole life through.  
Your eyes reveal that you have the soul of  
An angel white as snow.  
How long must I play the role of  
A gloomy Romeo?  
Oh, please.  
Say you're not intending to please  
Speed that happy ending and please  
Tell me that you love me too.  
  
(Bing whistles and da da dees)  
  
Your eyes reveal that you have the soul of  
An angel white as snow.  
How long must I play the role of  
A gloomy Romeo?  
Oh, please  
Say you're not intending to tease  
Speed that happy ending and please,  
Tell me that you love me too.
