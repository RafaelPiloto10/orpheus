You come home late at night  
You tell me it's all right  
But something must be wrong  
I want to hold you close  
But your reaction shows  
You keep me hanging on  
I'm tired of all your lies  
Your silly alibies  
Don't want to play that game  
If you don't know the rules  
I'll send you back to school  
You put a man to shame  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
What happened to our plans  
We've got a one night stand  
You'd better let it be  
If there's another man  
I'll do the best i can  
To bring you back to me  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life
