Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness  
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain  
If I said that you're my friend  
And our love would never end  
How long before I had your trust again  
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside  
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you won't take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what you'd believe it is -  
Well I guess it never is  
It's these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah, I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
'Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs  
So now I've closed the door  
To keep the cold outside  
Seems somehow I've found the will to live  
But how can I forget you  
Or try not to reject you  
When we both know it takes time to forgive  
  
Sweetness is a virtue  
And you lost your virtue long ago  
You know I'd like to hurt you  
But my conscience always tells me no  
You could sell your body on the street  
To anyone whom you might meet  
Who'd love to try and get inside  
And bust your innocence open wide  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations  
Gonna watch the big screen in my head  
I'd rather take a detour  
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer  
Your train of thought has cut me off again  
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one  
Better tame that boy for he's a man  
Sweetheart don't make me laugh  
You's gettin' too big for your pants  
And I's think maybe you should  
Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion -  
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes it's best to walk away  
Me I'm just here hangin' on  
It's my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
I've worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
I'm taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love that's passed away  
I know it's never easy  
So why should you believe me  
When I've always got so many things to say  
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made  
'Cause playful hearts  
Can sometimes be enraged  
You know I tried to wake you  
I mean how long could it take you  
To open up your eyes and turn the page  
  
Kindness is a treasure  
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown  
So I'd say it for a good measure  
To all the ones like you I've known  
Ya know I'd like to shave your head  
And all my friends could paint it red  
'Cause love to me's a two way street  
An all I really want is peace  
  
But my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Affection is a blessing  
Can you find it in your sordid heart  
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether  
But the tremor tore my pad apart  
Yeah I know it's hard to face  
When all we've worked for's gone to waste  
But you're such a stupid woman  
And I'm such a stupid man  
But love like time's got its own plans  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
Yeah  
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane  
  
Love's so strange
