There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know that there will never be another love  
Who could ever be the love that You are  
'Cause You had so much to lose  
But still You gave it up for Your scars  
But that's the way You are  
And if I spent my life attending Universities  
Educated in the wisdom of men  
And if I could even quote a guy like Socrates  
Even then I couldn't comprehend  
That there will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know I'll never understand the mystery  
If I live to be a hundred and three  
How You died to live the love You give to me  
There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
There will never be another  
Who has loved me like You
