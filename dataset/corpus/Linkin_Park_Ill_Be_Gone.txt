Like shining oil, this night is dripping down  
Stars are slipping down, glistening  
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now  
No deceiving now, it's time you let me know  
Let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,  
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
Let the sun fade out and another one rise  
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
  
This in between us is getting thinner now  
Into winter now, bitter sweet  
Across that horizon this sun is setting down  
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And tell them I couldn't help myself  
And tell them I was alone  
Oh, tell me I am the only one  
And there's nothing left to stop me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be gone (I'll be gone)
