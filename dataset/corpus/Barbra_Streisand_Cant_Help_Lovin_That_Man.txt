[From "Show Boat"]  
  
Oh listen sister,  
I love my mister man,  
And I can't tell you why  
There is no reason why I should love that man,  
It must be somethin' that de angels have planned.  
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,  
I gotta love one man till I die.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.  
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,  
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
When he goes away, that's a rainy day,  
And when he comes back that day is fine,  
The sun will shine!  
He can come home as late as can be,  
Home without him ain't no home to me,  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.
