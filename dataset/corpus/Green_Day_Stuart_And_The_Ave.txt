Standing on the corner of  
Stuart and the Avenue  
Ripping up my transfer  
And a photograph of you  
You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existance  
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance  
  
Well, destiny is dead  
In the hands of bad luck  
Before it might have made some sense  
But now it's all fucked up  
  
Seasons change as well as minds  
And I'm a two faced clown  
You're mommy's little nightmare  
Driving daddy's car around  
I'm beat down and half brain dead  
The long lost king of fools  
I may be dumb  
But I'm not stupid enough to stay with you  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Well, destiny is dead  
In the hands of bad luck  
Before it might have made some sense  
But now it's all fucked up  
  
All fucked up  
All fucked up
