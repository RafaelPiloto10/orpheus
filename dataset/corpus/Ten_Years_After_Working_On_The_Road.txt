I've been working on the road about fifteen years  
Been blowing my mind, I've been blasting my ears  
Don't you know, babe?  
I've been sleeping all day and working all night  
I made a lot of money, but it don't feel right  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
Well, I've seen the world and it's seen me  
In a strange kind of way I guess I'm free  
Don't you know, babe?  
Well, I've seen it bad and I've seen it good  
But, now, I want to clear my blood  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
I've got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
  
Well, I tried to live the way I should  
I've shed some tears and sweated blood  
Don't you know, babe?  
And I think it's time I took a break  
'Cause I have took all I can take  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
I've got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
Take me home, babe
