Folded in your fleshy purse  
I am floating once again  
While the muted sounds are pumping rhythm  
All the walls close in on me  
Pressure's building wave on wave  
Till the water breaks - and outside I go, oh  
  
One dot, that's on or off, defines what is and what is not, one dot  
Two dot, a pair of eyes, a voice, a touch, complete surprise, two dot  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
Three dot, a trinity, a way to map the universe  
Three dot  
Four dot, is what will make a square, a bed to build on, it's all there,  
Four dot  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
All the slow clouds pass us by  
Make the Empire State look high  
As you take me in your sea-stained sweetness  
It spills, it tingles and it stings  
All the pleasure that it brings  
'Til the door has let the outside inside here  
  
Well on the floor there's a long wooden table  
On the table there's an open book  
On the page there's a detailed drawing  
And on the drawing is the name I took  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
  
My ghost likes to travel  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
  
The breathing stops, I don't know when  
In transition once again  
Such a struggle getting through these changes  
And it all seems so absurd  
To be flying like a bird  
When I do not feel I've really landed here.
