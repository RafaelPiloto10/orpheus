Gitchy, gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da do run run  
You won't get far  
  
I'm machine  
I'm obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Lobotomy  
  
I wanna suck, I wanna lick  
I want to cry and I want to spit  
Tears of pleasure  
Tears of pain  
They trickle down your face the same  
  
It's how you look  
Not how you feel  
A city of glass  
With no heart  
  
If I had a tail  
I'd own the night  
If I had a tail  
I'd swat the flies  
  
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
Gitchy, gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da doo ron ron  
It won't get far  
  
Animals in  
The midnight zone  
When you own the world  
You're always home  
  
Get your hands dirty  
Roll up them sleeves  
Brainwashed or true believers?  
Buy flash cars  
Diamond rings  
Expensive holes to bury things  
  
I'm machine  
I'm obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Immortality  
  
If I had a tail  
I'd own the place  
If I had a tail  
I'd swat the flies  
  
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
See me dancing on the stars  
See me dance  
  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night
