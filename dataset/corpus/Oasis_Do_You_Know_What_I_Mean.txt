Step off a train, all alone at dawn  
Back into the hole where I was born  
Sun in the sky, never raised an eye to me  
  
There's blood on the tracks, and they must be mine  
Fool on the hill, and I feel fine  
Don't look back, 'cause you know what you might see  
  
Look into the wall of my mind's eye  
I think I know, but I don't know why  
Questions of the answers you might need  
  
Comin' in a mess, going out in style  
I ain't good lookin', but I'm someone's child  
No one can give me the air that's mine to breathe  
  
I met my maker, I made him cry  
And on my shoulder, he asked me why  
His people won't fly through the storm  
I said listen up man, they don't even know you're born  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
I don't really care for what you believe  
So open up your fist and you will receive  
The thoughts and the words of every man you'll meet  
  
Get up off the floor of the leaving line  
No one's ever gonna ever ask you twice  
Get all the fuss and bring it all home to me  
  
I met my maker, I made him cry  
And on my shoulder, he asked me why  
His people won't fly through the storm  
I said listen up now, they don't even know you're born  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
