Usher speaking  
Yo!  
What's sup?  
Hey!  
My name is Usher,  
You can trust there ain't  
No punks in this house,  
And if you really wanna know what my name is  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Word,  
Right!  
Just call me the mack  
Anytime baby,  
Cause I ain't confused  
Usher singing  
I maybe got some,  
But I got a  
Whole lot on manly in me  
So I'm afraid  
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)  
I don't mind  
If you wanna come by my crib  
And chill,  
But just be sure  
That you call me first  
Because the last girl that tried  
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)  
Learned how to play a player  
And do you know why,  
Because the mack  
Hook  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Cause I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Or I'll get back with you  
It's a well known fact  
That I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Now, baby I ain't dumb  
And all those silly  
Games that you play  
I see right through  
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)  
I don't have a lot of girls,  
But I gotta know  
I'll get the respect that I give  
That's just the way I live  
Because the last girl  
I had was moving  
Things too fast (Slow down)  
She tried to pull a fooler  
And do you know  
What had happened  
Hook (twice)  
Usher's Rap  
The mack is right here  
And yes I care as much  
Just giving a little love  
It's spreading everywhere  
You see it's  
Here  
Here  
And here  
Catch a feeling  
I'm having a little trouble  
I know my girl will always  
Hit it  
Pit it  
Like an orange  
Cause it looks  
Like numbness  
My lovin' and  
Hugin'  
And bitterness  
My peeps keep  
Pumpin'  
Humpin'  
On stage  
I'm engaged  
And yes  
The truth is it  
You see an  
Ugly woman  
You better change  
Usher singing  
Oh, yes  
Like Ushers' my name  
I can't go changing  
My ways (Oh, no)  
As long as I'm chillin'  
Then baby  
You can call me the mack  
Hook (3 times)
