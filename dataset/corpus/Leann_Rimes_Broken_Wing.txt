Today I watched a robin  
In our front yard  
I thought by now that they should all be gone.  
With winter 'round the corner  
Snow on its way  
Surely something must be wrong.  
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her  
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate  
And the song that she was singing  
Seemed to say "I'll be right here"  
"I'd like to go, but your love's made me stay."  
  
He's got a broken wing  
And that's why he can't fly  
She just can't leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
They're just like you and me  
Oh you should've heard her sing  
They won't give up  
It's just a broken wing.  
  
I wish we all could learn  
What they seem to have found  
To love our families  
When trouble comes around  
I'll bet that God saw fit  
To show them unto me  
Him on the ground  
Her in that tree.  
  
He's got a broken wing  
And that's why he can't fly  
She just can't leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
They're just like you and me  
Oh you should've heard her sing  
They won't give up  
We won't give up  
They won't give up  
It's just a broken wing.  
  
Ooh  
It's just a broken wing.
