Secret message for a rendez-vous  
Distant fire it's hurting you  
It's so sad  
Good love go's bad  
Tears of love will make me sad  
Frozen teardrops  
Running with the night  
Sorry doesn't always make it right  
Tears of love tears in my heart  
Why did love just break apart break apart?  
  
I'm riding on a white swan  
I need your love tonight  
I'm riding through a hard storm  
Don't treat me like a child  
  
I'm riding on a white swan  
I've got just what you need  
I'm riding on a white swan  
You've got the best of me  
  
On the wings of a nightingale  
Playing games your love for sale  
Then my girl belongs to yesterday  
No return don't lose your way  
It's more than just the two of us  
Heart is open come on, trust  
Love I gave for your mystic smile  
Should I go (?)  
Or stay awhile stay awhile  
  
I'm riding on a white swan
