Now, your grandma's, and my grandma's,  
Sittin' by the fire  
My grandma told your grandma,  
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire."  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, now (hey now) Hey now, (hey now)  
Iko-iko an dey (yeah)  
Chakko mo fino, ah-nah-ney  
Chakko mo fi-nah-ney  
  
Now, your flag boy and my flag boy  
Was sittin' by the fire  
My flag boy told your flag boy  
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Hey, hey now)  
Now, look at my king,  
All dressed in red

He'll kill ya dead  
Chakko mo fi-nah-ney  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Iko!
