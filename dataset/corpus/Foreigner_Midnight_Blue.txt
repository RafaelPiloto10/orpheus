Ain't got no regrets  
And I ain't losin' track of  
Which way I'm going  
I ain't gonna double back, no  
Don't want no misplay  
Put on no display  
And angel no  
But I know my way  
Oh yeah, oh oh, oh oh  
  
I used to follow  
Yeah, that's true  
But my following days are over  
Now I just got to follow thru in  
I remember what my father said  
He said "son, life is simple"  
It's either cherry red  
  
Or midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
You were the restless one  
And you did not care that  
I was the trouble boy  
Lookin' for a double dare  
I won't apologize for the  
Things I've done and said  
But when I win your heart  
I'm gonna paint it cherry red  
I don't want to talk about it  
What you do to me, I can't live without it  
And you might think that it's  
Much too soon for us to go this far  
  
Into the midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
It's midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
The things could be different  
But that'd be a shame, 'cause  
I'm the one who could feel the sun  
Right in the pouring rain  
I won't say where and I  
Don't know when but  
Soon there's gonna come a day, babe  
I'll be back again  
Yeah, I'll be back for you  
Ah ah ah ah, you see I'm saving up my love  
  
Midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Into the midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Another midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue, (woah) oh oh, oh oh, it's midnight blue  
Into the midnight blue, (oh) oh, oh oh oh  
Midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Midnight blue, oh, oh oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Into the midnight blue, oh, oh oh oh
