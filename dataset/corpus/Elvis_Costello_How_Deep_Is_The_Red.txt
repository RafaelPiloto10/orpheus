Is this is not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girl's heart?  
That a king may send to battle  
Is this not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
If red is the breast of soldier's tunic hung with a silver medal  
And red is the thorn that protects the rose,  
A deeper red than the petal  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled,  
The debt of our sins to settle?  
How deep is the red?  
How deep is the red?  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
Is this is not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girl's heart?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??
