I'm in love with a dolly named 'Glendora'  
She works in the window of a big department stor-a!  
Eyes of blue, hair like gold  
Never been young, but she'll never get old...  
Oh Glendora...I want to see more of you!  
  
O' Glendora...O' Glendora...  
O' Glendora...I want to see more of you!  
  
She's so shy that I don't know how I found her  
With three big body guards always workin' around her!  
One just nods, an' two just grins  
An' three got a mouth full of safety pins...  
O' Glendora...I want to see more of you!  
( You...more of you! )  
  
O' Glendora...O' Glendora...  
O' Glendora...I want to see more of you!  
(...more of you! )  
  
I stand left an' I stand right  
Outta my head 'cause I'm outta sight...  
O' Glendora...I want to see more of you!  
  
Late last night at the store they did some changin'...  
An' I stood watchin' when they started re-arrangin'...  
She lost her wig, she lost her arms  
An' when they got through she lost all of her charms  
O' Glendora...what did they do to you?  
  
What they do, what they do, what they do ?  
O' Glendora...O' Glendora...  
O' Glendora...what did they do to you?  
  
What they do, what they do, what they do ?  
O' Glendora...O' Glendora...  
O' Glendora...what did they do to you?  
  
Do to you, oh what did they do to you?  
O' Glendora...what did they do to you?
