Baby picks off your plate--yours look's better  
And she throws hers on the floor  
Here, in the home of the brave  
And the land of the free  
The first word that baby learns is more  
  
So you're out there floating like a big, puffy cloud  
With the pool and the charcoal  
And the kids and the wife  
Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted  
And you step out into life  
  
And it's still gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
Now it's take and take takeover, takeover  
It's all take and never give  
All these trumped up towers  
They're just golden showers  
Where are people supposed to live?  
  
You can arm yourself, alarm yourself  
But there's nowhere you can run  
'Cause a man with a briefcase  
Can steal more money  
Than any man with a gun  
  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
Said gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
You got the price of admission--  
You don't have to ask permission  
To take somethin' from another man  
You cross a lawyer with the godfather, baby  
Make you an offer that you can't understand  
  
From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington  
From men to women to men  
It's a nation of noses pressed up against the glass  
They've seen it on the TV  
And they want it pretty fast  
  
You spend your whole life  
Just pilin' it up there  
You got stacks and stacks and stacks  
Then, Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder  
But you don't see no hearses with luggage racks  
  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got
