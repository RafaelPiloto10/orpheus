I've got money to burn  
I've got life on the avenue  
I've got nothing to learn  
I just do what I want to do  
I've got places to go  
I've got lines on the telephone  
I've got nothing to show  
For all this time that I spend alone  
But if I wanted someone, someone to care  
And if I needed someone,  
Would you be there  
I want to look into your eyes  
(Chorus)  
And get a feel for your love  
(where would I be)  
I've got a feel for your love  
(where would I be)  
I've got a feel for your love  
(where would I go)  
I have something to give  
I got a feeling that I never knew  
I have a reason to live  
And all I want is to be with you  
If I gave you my heart  
Would you take what I have for you  
I have fallen so hard  
And I will do what you want me to  
And now I'm wanting someone  
Someone to share  
And if you are that someone  
Will you be there?  
So when I look into your eyes  
(Chorus)
