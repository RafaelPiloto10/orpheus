Lost and all alone.  
I always thought that I could make it on my own.  
But since you left I hardly make it through the day.  
My tears get in the way, and I need you back to stay.  
  
I wonder through the night  
Search the world for the words to make it right.  
All I want is the way it used to be  
With you here holding me.  
I've got to make you see,  
That I'm lost with out your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
I'm as helpless as a ship without a wind,  
A touch without a feel  
I can't believe its real  
And someday I'll wake and find my heart won't have to break.  
  
Yes, I'm lost with out your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
All I want is the way it used to be  
I need you here with me.  
Oh darling can't you see,  
If we had love before we can have it back once more..
