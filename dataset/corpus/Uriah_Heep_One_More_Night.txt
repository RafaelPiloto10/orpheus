One more night  
  
City lights are  
Burning in the distance  
Seems they're tellin' me  
To hurry home  
But I can't push these  
Wheels of mine no harder  
So hold on baby for  
One more night alone  
  
There's time for me to take just  
One look over my shoulder  
One last glance at  
What's been going on  
'Cause I'll be there at  
First light in the morning  
We'll pick up the pieces  
And baby, then we'll be long gone  
  
Pick up the pieces and run with me  
As fast as you can  
You know you always said  
I was the man  
Pick up the pieces, let's do it now  
Let's say our last farewell  
Tomorrow may be too late  
As far as I can tell
