Hey baby, listen up  
I'm not in love with you  
You keep runnin' off at the mouth  
And someone else can scratch my back  
And I could care less about your legs  
I just want to see 'em walk all over me  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
So don't think about movin' any closer, baby  
Just forget about it  
You body may be a weapon on legs  
But hey, I'm not fallin' for that  
Don't you get it, I'm not impressed at all  
I just want to see you crawl all over me  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
Don't you understand  
Don't you understand  
  
Tell me when your eyes say yes  
How can your lips say no  
A girl like you shouldn't be surprised  
It's just I hate to be nice  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice
