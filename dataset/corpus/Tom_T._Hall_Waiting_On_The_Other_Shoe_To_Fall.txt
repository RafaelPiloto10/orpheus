When I was a young man I busted my jeans hopping a freight down to New Orleans  
Worked on the oil rigs and played in the bars but nothing ever killed me so
far  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall and right now you're walking out on
me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And I am waitin' on the other shoe to fall  
  
[Fiddle]  
  
Well I joined the army and I did my time they sent me right up to the front
lines  
People were shoutin' and shootin' at me but I had to keep America free  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall...  
  
[Dobro]  
  
I've been to California and I've been to New York  
And all in between I had beans on my fork  
Clothes on my back and a song on my mind but I've never met a woman like your
kind  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall...  
  
[Fiddle]  
  
Well right down the street there's an old boardin' house  
You better be careful bout throwin' me out  
When she hears my footsteps comin' up their stairs she's gonna start combing
her hair  
She's a waitin' on the other shoe to fall right now you're walking out on me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And she is waitin' on the other shoe to fall
