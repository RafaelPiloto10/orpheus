Worn and gnawn  
A little hole  
Just a small hole  
Letting in a sick wind  
In small puffs  
  
  
Yo-ho hole  
Yo-ho hole  
Through which blow  
A small sick wind  
Yo-ho hole  
Yo-ho-hole  
Puff puff  
The sick wind blows  
  
  
Slupping stitches leading to so slight a hole  
Slipping in a sick wind  
Slippery sickly wind  
  
  
Yo-ho-hole  
Yo-ho-hole  
Across the threshole  
A little sick wind  
Yo-ho-hole  
Yo-ho-hole  
Yo-ho  
The sick wind blows
