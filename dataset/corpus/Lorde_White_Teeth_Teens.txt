We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day yeah  
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now  
And if I like it then we'll stay  
Impress the empress, take a shot now  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop  
I like your reckoning  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
If you want we'll help tonight to split his schemes  
Give the bruises out like gifts  
You'll get the picture of your dreams  
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers  
Fill my dashboard just the same  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning,  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this when we're  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning,  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
(And everything works out so good)  
(I wear the robe like no one could)  
  
I'll let you in on something big  
I am not a white teeth teen  
I tried to join but never did  
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood  
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit  
And do nothing and love it  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
(White teeth teens are out)  
And everything works out so good  
(I wear the robe like no one could)  
White teeth teens are out
