I know this feeling inside  
Has just made up my mind  
I'm gonna take this chance  
And do what's in my heart  
You always said that  
You'd stand by me  
And help me get along  
So understand  
I must do what's in my heart  
  
I know this feeling inside  
Has helped me to carry on  
So as the days go by  
And the nights that never end  
You play the clubs  
And you play the game  
The next day you will find  
You'll have to try and  
Please that fool again  
Don't you know that  
  
Fools play at games  
Don't you know that  
Fools play at games  
And I know that  
I'm not afraid of you  
  
Day after day I feel this way  
That I need to be moving on  
You know I depend on you  
Don't get me wrong  
I'll throw the dice and  
I play the game  
And hope we get along  
Even then I won't be fooled again  
  
So I've read your words and  
I've signed my name  
But I can't make up my mind  
If you really care or you're  
Playing your games
