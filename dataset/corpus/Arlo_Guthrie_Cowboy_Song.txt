This morning I woke up alone  
I spent the day time on my own  
Lots of people have come and gone  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Last night I sat till closing time  
Thinking of the things that crossed my mind  
You were the one I was thinking of  
I guess it must be that I'm just in love  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right, it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
I hope they play this song of mine  
On the jukebox for a dime  
Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong  
You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song
