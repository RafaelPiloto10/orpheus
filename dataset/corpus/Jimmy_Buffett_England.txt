1971  
I have watched as the sun went down  
I have crashed as the room spun around  
Now she's gone, she can't be found  
And I'm down where I've been before  
Sat and watched as she bolts out the door  
Can't explain why the woman's sore  
It's gonna rain some more  
Chorus:  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder if's she's there  
'cause she took every cent of mine  
Paid it all to the pan am line  
Though she's gone, I hope she's fine  
Fly love of mine  
Chorus:  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder if's she's there  
So tally-ho  
Jolly good show  
My woman's gone to england
