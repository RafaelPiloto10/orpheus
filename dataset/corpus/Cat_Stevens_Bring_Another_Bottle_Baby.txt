Better bring another bottle with you baby  
If you really want to party then lets make it swing  
Right into the morning.  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
'Cause I really want to make this little bell ring.  
Ding dong, ding.  
  
I feel cold and I want to get you by my side  
I feel bold and I want to show you how this man can ride.

I feel smooth and I really want to live it up  
If we groove then I promise you that we won't even stop  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
I get the feeling that you want to take off and fly  
High, high, well if my ceiling isn't high enough  
We'll burn up the sky.

Better bring another bottle with you baby  
Better try to bring another bottle now  
Better bring another bottle baby  
Better bring another bottle with you now.
