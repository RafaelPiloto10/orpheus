Chorus: I am not forgotten I am not forgotten I am not forgotten God knows my
name he knows my name  
  
Verse: Light over darkness strength over weakness joy over sadness he knows my
name father to the fatherless friend to the friendless hope for the hopeless
he knows my name  
  
Bridge: I will praise you I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made

Reprise of Not Forgotten  
  
Do you realize that you're alive at the greatest time in history  
  
We are the chosen generation we are the chosen generation we're gonna change
the world we're gonna change the world
