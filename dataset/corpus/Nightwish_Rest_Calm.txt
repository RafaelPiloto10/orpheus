I went to die in a seaside hotel  
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments  
  
Deathbed memories of home  
Never let me go  
  
Every little memory resting calm in me  
Resting in a dream  
Smiling back at me  
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home  
To caress the river with awe  
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me  
Resting in a dream  
Smiling back at me  
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home  
Rest calm and remember me  
  
You are the moon pulling my black waters  
You are the land in my dark closet  
Stay by my side until it goes dark forever  
When silent the silence comes closer
