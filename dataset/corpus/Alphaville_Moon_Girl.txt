Sometimes it seems the night will last forever  
sometimes it seems that darkness always falls  
a dark star woke you up and with a dark star, you go to bed  
you're sinking slowly into the deep  
you wonder if you ever touch the ground  
where you would walk through sparkling spheres,  
on strangest drugs and without fears  
you feel just like a little girl  
and all your dreams lie frozen on the moon  
you left them ther some time ago  
but it ain't true that you don't need them anymore  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
don't give up, kill the pain, don't start crying again  
here it comes, here it comes, the golden handshake of life  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
keep the faith, stop to fight  
and walk out into the night  
you're so strong, yes you are  
reach out for your star....  
Even those who are afraid to live  
they're dying some day  
sometimes it seems that silence crawls all over  
sometimes it's hell inside and hell out there  
your heart is nothing but a haunted place  
is that you in the mirror?  
You're all alone inside a world  
full of confusion and of strange alarms  
and though your courage left you long ago  
it doesn't mean that you don't have it anymore
