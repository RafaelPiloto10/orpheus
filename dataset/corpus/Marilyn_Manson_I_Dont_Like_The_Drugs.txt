"we're white and oh so hetero  
And our sex is missionary."  
  
Norm life baby  
"we're quitters and we're sober  
Our confessions will be televised. "  
  
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall  
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all  
  
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs  
  
Norm life baby  
"our god is white and unforgiving  
We're piss tested and we're praying."  
  
Norm life baby  
"I'm just a sample of a soul  
Made to look just like a human being."  
  
Norm life baby  
"we're rehabbed and we're ready  
For our 15 minutes of shame."  
  
Norm life baby  
"we're talkshown and we're pointing  
Just like christians at a suicide."  
  
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall  
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all  
  
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs  
  
"there's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope  
And we're feeling fine."  
  
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me  
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
