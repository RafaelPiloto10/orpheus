Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal
