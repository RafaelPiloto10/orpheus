[Verse 1]  
You take me down  
Spin me around  
You got me running all the lights  
Don't make a sound  
Talk to me now  
Let me inside your mind  
Don't know what you're thinking, sugar  
But I just got that feeling, sugar  
And I can hear sirens burning  
Red lights turning  
I can't turn now  
  
[Chorus]  
So hold on tight  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But baby this is getting serious Oh  
Detain the dangerous Oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Show me your soul  
I gotta know  
Bet that you're beautiful inside  
Toes are not grass  
Coming fast  
Come take the wheel and drive  
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar  
But I just got that feeling, sugar  
And I can hear sirens burning  
Red lights turning  
I can't turn now  
  
[Chorus]  
So hold on tight  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But baby this is getting serious Oh  
Detain the dangerous Oh  
Detain the dangerous  
  
[Bridge]  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I wanna do it again  
(Come on baby)  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I wanna do it again  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I wanna do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But baby this is getting serious Oh  
Detain the dangerous Oh  
Detain the dangerous
