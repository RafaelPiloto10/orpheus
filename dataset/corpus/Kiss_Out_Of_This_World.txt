Ah yeah!  
I was born to the human race  
Livin' life feelin' out of place  
People said I was wasting my time  
Looking to find my kind  
  
I saw you and I realized  
You got the fire burnin' in your eyes  
Let's get away, leave it all behind  
I'm ready to blow your mind  
  
I'll take you out of this world (to the other side)  
On a midnight rocket ('til the morning light)  
Going up, going down (it's gonna be alright)  
I'll take you out of this world tonight  
  
You and me we're like TNT  
Light the fuse that's inside of me  
You get your ticket when you understand  
I'm ready to be your man  
  
You got a hunger baby there's no doubt  
You got desire - gotta get it out  
I'll free your body, if you free your soul  
If you're ready to rock  
I'm ready to roll  
  
I'll take you out of this world (to the other side)  
On a midnight rocket ('til the morning light)  
Going up, going down (it's gonna be alright)  
I'll take you out of this world tonight  
  
I see the glow  
Burnin' down the midnight sky  
I feel the flow  
I'm gonna take you high  
  
I see the glow  
Burnin' down the midnight sky  
I feel the flow  
I'm gonna take you high  
C'mon!  
  
Yeah!  
I'll take you out of this world  
Take you out of this world  
On a midnight rocket  
I'll take you out of this world tonight  
  
Outta this world  
Outta this world  
Outta this world tonight  
Outta this world  
Outta this world  
Outta this world tonight  
Outta this world  
Outta this world  
Outta this world tonight
