"okay"  
I really do appreciate the fact you're sittin' here  
Your voice sounds so wonderful  
But yer face don't look too clear  
Bar maid bring a pitcher, another round o' brew  
"alright let's here it"  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"you're on the record!"  
Chorus:  
Why don't we get drunk and screw  
I just bought a water bed, it's filled up for me and you  
They say you are a snuff queen  
Honey I don't think that's true  
So, why don't we get drunk and screw.  
"I can't wait for 'em to put that label on my live album. you're sounding
absolutely wonderful out there, but we have invited the all girls choir from
lima, ohio down here and we can't here  
Too well now. we'd like all of you gentlemen out in the audience to just sorta
take a break, sit back and let's let these beautiful women of the nineties
tell us how they feel about it. ladies  
Ou ready? on the count of four. one, two, three, four."  
Chorus:  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"whoo yeah!"  
I just bought a waterbed it's filled up with elmer's glue."  
They say you are a snuff queen  
Let's see what all you macho men can do  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"oh yeah."  
Why don't we get drunk and screw  
"I think we better work this out amongst ourselves."  
Why don't we get drunk and screw, oooh yeah
