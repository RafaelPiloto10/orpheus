I saw, a glimpse, a shimmer, a shadow  
Of something, I had once but since lost  
And now I, I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore  
  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Just walk, just walk, by my side  
  
It starts with a glimpse  
A shimmer, a shadow  
Of something, I had once but since lost  
And now I, I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore  
  
The salt in my eyes, as I clear the border  
Imagining lines, shatter and shimmer  
I get to you, to ask you a question  
I get to you, to find out for certain  
Are you fixin'?  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Just walk, just walk, by my side  
  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Just walk, just walk, by my side  
Just walk, by my side  
  
Are you fixin', to come with me?  
Are you fixin', to fix me, fix me?  
  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Just walk, just walk, by my side  
  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes  
Don't even tell me where, we are going  
Just walk, just walk, just walk, just walk, by my side  
Just walk, by my side
