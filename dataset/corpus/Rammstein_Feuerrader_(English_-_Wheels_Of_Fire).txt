Put that collar on me  
then I'll go down on my knees  
and begin to bark  
the pain has never been better  
  
Open the cage  
bring me into the realm of stars  
  
Come hurt me slowly  
put chains on me  
and tie the knot tightly  
so that I can laugh  
  
Open the cage  
bring me into the realm of stars  
  
There where the stars have been  
wheels of fire turn  
we celebrate a passion  
the pain is beautiful like you
