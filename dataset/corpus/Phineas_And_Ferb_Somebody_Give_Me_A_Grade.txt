Oh yeah! I have got something to say!  
  
I have been burned by vague lesson plans and a free-floating curriculum!  
I like my rules, baby, etched in stone, 'cause you know I am going to stick to
them!  
Can I get a syllabus a little discipline? Judge me on a scale from A to F!  
You wasted all my time learning how to rhyme, now let me hang it from a treble
clef!  
  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
I need the man keeping me down!  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
Is there a red pen in this town?  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
I already said it, I need that extra credit today!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
And make it an A!  
  
Oh, I am so upset!  
I am stone cold honor role!  
I won't be told how to vent!  
I won't cry or sigh, I'm here to testify,  
Up with the establishment!  
  
My parents understand me, for conformity inside of me with which I can help
the system out!  
I ain't gonna waste my summer taking beatings from my drummer,  
Put a mic in front of me and I'll shout!  
  
Give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
You know I'm gonna wreck the curve!  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
The only letter I deserve!  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
This isn't a request, I demand there be a test today!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
Give me a grade!
