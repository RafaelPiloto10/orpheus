I've got more to lose, more to lose than you  
Cause I'm the only one in love between us too  
I know that I've been struck by lightning from above  
Cause I've been killed by love  
  
I got a longer fall, a longer fall to take  
Cause I'm a bigger fool with a bigger heart to break  
You pushed me way to far, a push became a shove  
And I was killed by love  
  
Drop me off in a crowded lonely city  
Everybody there was crying  
Drop me off in a town without pity  
And let me be the one that's dying  
  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Oh bye bye love  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
  
Killed by love (killed by love)  
Killed by love (killed by love)  
Killed by love (killed by love)  
Oh bye bye love (oh bye bye)  
  
Killed by love oh yeah  
Killed by love, I'm thinking fast baby  
Killed by love, you know you're killing me baby  
Baby, baby  
Oh bye bye love
