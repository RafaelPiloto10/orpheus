Wanda had a baby in nineteen fifty one.  
The father was stranger and a stranger was the son.  
Call that child James Lewis, call these rooms a home.  
Changing all them diapers polish all that chrome.  
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me  
All around the schoolyard playing all the games  
Running, laughing back and forth the kid with two first names  
Stranger in the closet, lock the diary  
The past is running faster singing harmony  
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me  
"God bless this kitchen" said the knick-knack shelf  
"The dinner's almost ready Go and wash yourself"  
Jimmy's growing up now and Wanda's growing old  
The time is growin' shorter the nights are long and cold  
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me  
Sneaking in the closet and through the diary  
Now, don't you know all he saw was all there was to see  
The whole town saw Jimmy on the six o'clock news  
His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes  
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me  
See'mon, baby, spend the night with me
