Hey you  
Where are you going  
You're not leaving me today  
Hey you  
What are you doing  
Put your things down and stay  
You should go, you should leave  
But without you, where would I be  
You can run, you can hide  
Girl, I know I'll never find  
Someone like you  
  
And I owe you like the rain owes dirt  
And I owe you like the love owes hurt  
Heart's like the mob  
And I'm willing to pay you back  
Every dime  
  
I'm into you deep  
Just give me time, a way I'll find  
I'm into you deep  
One more week at least  
I'm into you deep  
Can you take half for now  
I'm into you deep  
I wanna pay you back the love you gave me  
  
Hey you  
What are you doing  
Can't you see, I'm not fighting you today  
Hey you  
What are you saying  
There's no such thing as separate ways  
You should go, you should leave  
But without you, where would I be  
You can run, you can hide  
Girl I know I'll never find  
Someone like you  
  
The love director's calling this a wrap  
And our movie is half way through the credits  
And I just wanna skip the first  
Rewind back to the beginning  
I know my character's been the villain  
And you power of love deserves equal  
Please cast me back in the sequel
