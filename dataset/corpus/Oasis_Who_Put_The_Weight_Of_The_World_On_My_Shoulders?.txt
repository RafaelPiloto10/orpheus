Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?  
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?  
  
Lost behind a silver screen  
Are all the things you could've been to us  
  
So don't try to fuck up my head with your problems  
I'm just tryin' to fix up my bed in the doldrums  
  
Lost behind a silver screen  
Are all the things you could've been in Love and Life soooooo  
  
[Chorus:]  
Help me out my friend  
My head just started to hurt  
I don't pretend  
I've got all of the time in the world  
So now she's gone  
All alone in her own universe  
I still walk on  
'Til I hold you within my world  
  
Help me out my friend  
My head just started to hurt  
I won't pretend  
I've got all of the time in the world  
So now she's gone  
All alone in her own universe  
I still walk on  
'Til I hold you within my world  
  
Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?  
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?
