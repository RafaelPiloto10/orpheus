It's been said and done  
Every beautiful thought's been already sung  
And I guess right now here's another one  
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em  
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible  
A centerfold, a miracle, lyrical  
You've saved my life again  
And I want you to know baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat  
  
Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony  
There's no way to describe what you do to me  
You just do to me, what you do  
And it feels like I've been rescued  
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny  
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful  
You are, and I want you to know baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No one compares  
You stand alone, to every record I own  
Music to my heart that's what you are  
  
[Chorus]
