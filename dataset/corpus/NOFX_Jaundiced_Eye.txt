Black is beautiful, white is so pure  
Can you see a difference? all I see's a blur  
Is one color a virtue how can you be sure  
Ignorance the disease education the cure  
  
So how can you say that your proud of your race  
Proud of your gender  
Or proud of your faith  
Facism racism all starts out the same  
Stop feeding the fire and smother the flame  
  
Some people are smarter than others so dumb  
The reason behind this a cultural one  
And greatness isn't carried by blood  
So get off your high horse  
You're no better than us  
All seems infected that the infected spy  
As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye  
You're the infected you can never deny  
You're arrogant, you're insolent, you're living a lie
