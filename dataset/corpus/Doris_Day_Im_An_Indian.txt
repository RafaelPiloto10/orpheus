Like the Seminole  
Navajo  
Kickapoo  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Indian  
Too  
A Sioux uhu - a Sioux uhu  
  
Just like battle axe  
Hatchet face  
Eagle nose  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Inidan  
Too  
A Sioux uhu  
A Sioux uhu  
  
Some Indian summer's day without a sound  
I may hide away with Big Chief on the ground  
  
I'll have totem poles  
Tomahawks  
Small papoos  
Which will go to prove  
I'm an Indian  
Too  
  
With my chief in his tipi  
We'll raise an Indian family  
And I'll be busy night and day  
Looking like a flour sack  
With two papooses on my back  
And three papooses on the way  
  
I'm an Inidan  
Too...  
  
Some Indian's summer's day  
Withou a care  
I may run away with Bigchief's Son of a Bear  
And I'll wear moccasins  
Wompan beads  
Feather hats  
Which will go to prove  
I'm an Indian  
Too  
A Sioux uhu  
A Sioux uhu.
