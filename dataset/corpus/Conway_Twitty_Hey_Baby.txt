Hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When I saw you walking down the street  
I said that's the kind of girl I'd like to meet  
  
She's so pretty Lord, she's fine  
I'm gonna make her mine all mine  
Hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away  
That's when I wanna say  
Come on baby, give me a whirl  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Say hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away  
That's when I wanna say  
Come on baby give me a whirl  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Say hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Say hey hey baby  
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
