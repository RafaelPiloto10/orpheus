Dreams will all come true  
Being here with you  
And time will fly  
Caring each day more  
Than the day before  
Till spring rolls by  
And when the springtime has gone  
Will my love linger on  
  
'Cause I'll be loving you  
Always  
With a love that's true  
Always  
When the things that you plan  
Need a helping hand  
I will understand  
Always, always  
  
Days may not be fair  
Always  
But that's when I'll be there  
Always  
Not for just an hour  
No, no, not for just a day  
Not for just a year  
Oh but always  
  
Days may not be fair  
Always  
But that's when I'll be there  
Always  
Not for just an hour  
No, no, not for just a day  
Not for just a year  
Oh but always  
  
Until forever is through  
Until there's just me and you  
Always  
Oh always
