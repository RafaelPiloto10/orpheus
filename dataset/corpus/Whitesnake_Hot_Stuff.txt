I'm ready for you,  
Are you ready for me  
I've got a burning heart,  
It won't let me be  
I feel the hunger, my spirit yearns,  
I've got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight,  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff  
  
I'm hard to handle,  
Too hot to hold  
I can't seem to satisfy  
My heart an' soul  
I need a woman to set me free,  
A little Miss Understanding  
To feel the need in me  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight,  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough  
  
I'm ready for you,  
Are you ready for me  
I've got a burning heart,  
It won't let me be  
I feel the hunger, my spirit yearns,  
I've got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff  
  
Hot stuff, can't get enough hot stuff
