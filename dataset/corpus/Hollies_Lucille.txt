Lucille, you don't do your daddy's will  
Lucille, you don't do your daddy's will  
Well I ain't nothin' to ya  
But I love you still

Lucille, please come back where you belong  
Well now I'm beggin' to ya baby  
Please don't leave me alone  
  
Ah well I woke up this morning  
Lucille was not in sight  
Asked my friends about her  
All their lips were tight  
  
Lucille, please come back where you belong  
Well now I'm beggin' to ya baby,  
Please don't leave me alone  
  
Lucille, please come back where you belong  
Lucille, please come back where you belong  
Well now I'm beggin' to ya baby  
Please don't leave me alone  
  
I'm beggin' to ya baby  
Please don't leave me alone
