Hurry sundown, let the weary day be over  
I'm so tired of hurt, I've been taken  
My heart has been aching so  
Don't mind struggling, don't mind livin' a little  
If someday my kids are laughing together  
And have things I never own  
I can feel many changes are coming  
Beat them drums in a distance, a drumming  
Telling the world a new future has begun  
Yes, you got to hurry sundown  
I can't wait to see the morning  
There's a lot of work I must lend a hand to  
So bring on that brand new day  
Afraid tomorrow is on it's way  
So hurry down, hurry down sweet sun
