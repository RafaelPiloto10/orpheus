Trouble  
Don't you see  
That in your bed  
I find no sleep  
I confess you came because of me  
Trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
  
Cold wet stone  
Deep river bed  
Once so clean and clear now runs red  
You know too well  
Was me that called you here  
Trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
  
Oh sweet day  
Leave me behind  
I will never call on you  
Until the day I die  
Pray your mercy shine on me  
Pray your mercy shine  
  
Here I stand  
Head bowed for thee  
My empty heart begs you  
Leave me be  
But I confess  
You know too well  
That I have fallen  
Pray your mercy give to me  
Pray your mercy shine  
Trouble thou  
And trouble thee  
Let your mercy shine  
  
Cold wet stone  
River deep and red  
Your cold heart beats inside my head  
You know too well  
It was me that brought you here  
Ohhh trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
I pray your mercy shine on me  
Trouble let me be
