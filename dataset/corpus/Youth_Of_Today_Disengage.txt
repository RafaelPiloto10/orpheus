Well it's so sad to see all our good qualities  
Gradually slipping away and fading  
And we better act quick because I'm getting sick  
Of how much it's becoming degrading  
In this age when everything's falling apart  
Disengage don't think I'm crazy  
For not wanting to take part  
When morality is defeated  
Compassion is deleted  
All in the name of our desire  
And we've got to be blind  
Or just losing our minds  
If we can't see this world's on fire  
We've got to disengage  
Can't you see this age  
Dragging us down,  
Down to the ground  
We've got to disengage  
And I think it's sad that our society's gone mad  
Possessed by taking more than we need  
And our motivation's a sad situation  
Because it's fueled by anger envy and greed
