(Aretha Franklin)  
I love you, I love you  
I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
I love you, I love you  
And I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
My tears, my dearest of all, darling  
I know, I know, I know  
I know we've got to part  
Baby, baby, baby, it really doesn't hurt me that bad  
Because you're taking me with you and  
I'm keeping you right here in my arms  
It's all because I love you  
Call me, call me the hour  
Call me the minute, the second you get there
