Suppose I called you up tonight  
And told you that I love you  
And suppose I said I want to come back home  
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson  
  
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone  
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted  
And it's killing me to be so far away  
Would you tell my that you love me too  
  
And would we cry together  
Or would you simply laugh at me and say...  
  
[Chorus]  
I told you so, I told you so  
I told you some day you'd come crawling back  
And asking me to take you in  
I told you so, but you had to go  
Now I've found somebody new  
And you will never break my heart in two again  
  
If I got down on my knees  
And told you I was yours forever  
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand  
Would we get that old-time feeling  
  
Would we laugh and talk for hours  
The way we did when our love first began  
Would you tell me that you've missed me too  
And that you've been so lonely  
  
And you've waited for the day that I returned  
And we'd live and love forever  
And that I'm your one and only  
Or would you say the tables finally turned  
  
And would you say...  
  
[Chorus]
