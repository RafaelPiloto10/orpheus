I lay out some paper, I take out my pen  
Turn on my table lamp and here I go again  
It's time to write a letter, I'm in the mood tonight  
Gotta find a way to tell you how I feel inside  
  
So I write a little,  
And I cry a little  
It's so hard to find a way  
To say goodbye a little  
But somewhere in the middle  
My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little,  
And cry a little tear  
And I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
  
God I miss you  
Can't be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good  
'Cause you're my only cure for lonely  
I'd call if I could  
  
Well I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
Wishing you were here  
Well I'm writing a little,  
And wishing you were here  
And I write a little,  
And I cry a little tear  
And I'm writing,  
And wishing you were here
