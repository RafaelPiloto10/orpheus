Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
(I) hate to see you lonely  
Losin' me this way  
Lookin' for the man  
Who stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my baby's leavin'  
My pony won't go  
Where I want him to go no more  
Gotta make your mind up  
If you're gonna stay  
I don't see no sense in  
Anything you say  
Since you met the guy  
Who told you I was wrong  
You do all the livin'  
While I do all the givin'  
My pony won't go  
He can't find no oats to eat  
Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
(I) hate to see you lonely  
Losin' me this way  
Lookin' for the man  
Whole stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my baby's leavin'  
My pony won't go  
Where I want him to go no more
