Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought I'd write to you  
How can I say how I feel ?  
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake?  
I just hope that I'm awake  
I say alright I knew  
(I knew)  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I was wrong you were right  
(That's a line I cannot find)  
I could not say goodbye  
(to explain just why I lied)  
Why's it always feel the same?  
(slightly drunk what you said to me)  
I'm in love once again  
(can't fall in love without misery)  
  
I'm pretty sad but so what?  
I should be glad but I'm not  
I'm confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so that's tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
(once more)  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all, I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel
