Almost there, we're almost there  
How wonderful, wonderful our love will be  
For you, for me  
  
We're almost there where we will share  
A warm caress, tenderness, a dream come true  
For me, for you  
  
Love has waited such a long time  
Now we're a kiss apart  
Darling, this is the right time  
To let the kisses start  
  
For you're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
  
You're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes, close your eyes  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
Almost there  
Almost there
