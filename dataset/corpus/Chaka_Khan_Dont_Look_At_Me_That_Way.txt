Another time, you were the one in my life  
And this world of mine just turned around you  
Another time, you were the love of my life  
That was so long ago, now you're here  
And those feelings are starting to reappear  
Another time I would've run to you  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now I'm finally over you  
But don't look at me that way  
'Coz I'm trying to be strong  
And I'm begging you, baby  
Don't you look at me that way  
'Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
Got someone, somebody new in my life  
I've got someone who cares about me  
And what we had is only what used to be  
I'm happy now, happy with someone else  
But when you're close  
I know the flame has never died  
And now it's burning me alive  
So don't look at me that way  
'Coz I'm trying to be strong  
And I'm begging you, baby  
Don't you look at me that way  
'Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now I'm finally over you
