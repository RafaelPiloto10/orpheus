[Inspired by Dinah Washington's 1955 recording of a song introduced by Rudy
Vallee in 1928]  
I could show the world how to smile  
I could be glad all of the while  
I could change the gray skies to blue  
If I had you  
I could leave the old days behind  
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind  
I could start my life anew  
If I had you  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burning desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
[Instrumental - first two verses]  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burnin' desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
Baby, if I had you
