Through the night we rise in pairs  
Lords at night we ride  
From the depths of Hell's domain  
Reborn to reign this night  
Roam throughout the endless wars  
Hold high his name we must  
Warriors from the gates of Hell  
In Lord Satan we trust  
  
[Chorus]  
Stalking the night can't you feel I'm near  
Watching each step that you take  
I take lives and show all no mercy this night  
Attack those not knowing my force  
  
Brothers of the Prince of Night  
By bargains we have made  
Allies with the darkened souls  
Our legions we must save  
Fight for our eternal quest  
God can't save you in time  
Evil stalks the night with us  
Your soul it shall be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am the menace in your eyes  
The one you can't escape  
Your life falls in my grasp  
Your know your end is near  
You pray your God will help  
His strength no match for mine  
Your last hope slips away  
Thy soul begins to bleed  
I tear your flesh to shreds  
Burn holes throughout your mind  
Your eyes now filled with blood  
A victim of my force  
In endless agony  
You realize your defeat  
Recite my Master's chants  
Your soul now his to keep
