There's a girl down a lonely street,  
Breaking hearts seven days a week.  
She got an look in her eye,  
For a red-blooded guy like me.  
I'm breaking out in a cold cold sweat,  
And I'm in a kind of rush to get to...  
  
Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Little Mistreater,  
Yeah, that's her name.  
  
Treating love like a game  
I'm so scared when she calls my name,  
This kind of girl drives a man insane.  
You give her all that you can,  
She raps on your door again.  
I need some time just to catch my breath,  
Tell me honey do I past your test.  
The Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her.  
Little Mistreater,  
Yeah, that's her name.  
  
She's an old flame  
  
(Tell me now) Somebody tell me  
(Somebody) What to do when your  
Love won't leave, (heart won't leave)  
I can almost hear the sad goodbyes,  
When I see her walking down the street.  
  
There she goes.  
  
The Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Yeah, that's her name  
  
Playing the game  
  
Just, just, just....Little Mistreater  
(Every day she's got guys on a string)  
Little Mistreater  
(She's a girl don't have to do anything)  
Little Mistreater (repeated......)
