Is a dream a lie, when you know it won't come true.  
And I feel like I can't be with or without you.  
And I must hide cause my faith is on the run.  
Or do I have to hang on till I know you know.  
  
If you believe in me.  
If you believe in me.  
If you believe in me.  
  
Is there a world out there where no one gets big lest.  
Cause I'm tired of dreaming the future becoming past.  
And I must hide now 'cause my faith is on the run.  
Or do I have to hang on till I know you know.  
  
If you believe in me.  
If you believe in me.  
If you believe in me.  
  
I want to know somebody.  
I want to know somebody else.  
I want to know somebody.  
I want to know somebody else.  
  
If you believe in me.
