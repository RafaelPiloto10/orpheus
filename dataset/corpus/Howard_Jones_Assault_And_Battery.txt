The lives were taken  
For feasts at the table  
A life of misery  
Ending with a shock  
  
Brutal murder (brutal murder)  
All hands to the slaughter  
Mass torture  
All hands to the knife  
  
And I can hear the screams  
With the knife, the jolt, the wring  
They must follow in our dreams  
Carrying a twisted sting  
  
Children's stories with their farmyard favourites  
At the table in a different disguise  
  
Don't talk to me of health  
Or something someone else will do  
We're talking about the act  
Of taking life for me and you  
And I hear their screams
