The spirit of Fatima still rules the Earth  
She knows your future, she knows what it's worth  
Sister Fatima has God-given powers  
And on 42nd Street a shop that sells flowers  
Is her palace, come and be healed  
  
She knows all your business, your health and your ills  
She'll counsel your weddings, divorces and wills  
For full restoration five dollars an hour  
And with each consultation a free holy flower  
And if she likes you, well you can have two  
  
And I came from nowhere like you and your friend  
My searching and wandering went on without end  
My future was dim, my spirit was crushed  
In one sacred moment my questions were hushed  
  
I'm a servant of fate in this garden of truth  
A humble recruit of the taffeta booth  
Where all things are known but few are revealed  
Where sins are forgotten and sickness is healed  
For five dollars the flower is free
