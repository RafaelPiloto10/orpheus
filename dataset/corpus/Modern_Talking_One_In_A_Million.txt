You are one in a million  
You are one in a million  
You are oh love my love  
You are everything for me  
You are one in a million  
You are one in a million  
You caught me with your charms  
When you held me in your arms  
  
Oh lonely life, I hear your heartbeat  
Deep in the night  
I need you so  
Know that I can't let you go  
Dim all the lights and let me hold you so tight  
The night is yours and mine  
You're looking fine  
Just tonight  
  
Just like a child  
You're sometimes weak, sometimes you're wild  
You understand, sometimes I feel like a man  
Stay here tonight  
And let me hold you so tight  
You are the one for me  
You are my dreams, my reality
