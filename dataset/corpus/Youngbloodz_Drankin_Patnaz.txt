And not once but twice am I back on line  
Remarkably delivering these words of mine  
And when I come forth I come with such a force  
You believe that it's been nice since the last time you felt the need  
And that's to get loose and let you soul be free  
Cause when we step out in this vision you gon' surely see  
And ain't no way in hell we gon' let that ride  
While you huggin' on the wall bein' cool denied  
Now it done jumped off in the blind of an eye  
And everybody's off the hook feelin' good and high  
Cause it's the last call for alcohol so just jook and drink  
and have a ball cause' we gon' party long until the wee hours  
And will it ever end I truly don't doubt it  
Youngbloodz is the truth you seen now go shout it  
And come back tomorrow and watch the world crowd it  
  
My drankin' patna, my ace, my dawg, know who I'm gon' call  
My drankin' patna, my ace boon coon, when it's time to cut the fool

And just me and my roll dawg always go half
