It's 2:11 and I'm stressing  
Watching T.V in my hotel suite  
I check my service every second  
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me  
  
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone  
Turned on in my purse by the bed  
And before I fall asleep  
I guess I'll just check my machine  
  
Again and again because I'm  
Obsessing on you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Zoning out thinking about  
You and me between the sheets  
I want to get intimate  
But you're not within my reach  
  
So I'll have a little more wine  
And I'll try to drink you  
Out of my head  
And I'll lay awake awhile  
  
'Til I'm high enough I can  
Forget about you until  
I wake up again  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
ome lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Slipping into dreams  
I feel my love surround you  
Ny subconscious seems  
To weave itself around you  
  
Do you care for me  
Beyond idolization  
Tell me how you feel  
But don't keep me at bay  
  
'Cause I won't be waiting long  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll
