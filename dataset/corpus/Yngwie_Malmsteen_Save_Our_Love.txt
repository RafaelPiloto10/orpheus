Once we were one  
Now we're worlds apart  
Deep inside you know you are my other heart  
My memories seem like yesterday  
Can't believe it's all so far away  
All these years  
All our tears  
Still we sing the same old song  
Let's make right all that went wrong  
There's no beginning there's no end  
There is no reason to pretend  
Crying from help from above  
We've got to save our love  
You said to me  
That we hold the key  
Eternal love we give and take  
It was meant to be  
My love for you  
Was always true  
Still we sing the same old song  
Let's make right all that went wrong  
There's no beginning there's no end  
There is no reason to pretend  
Crying from help from above  
We've got to save our love  
All these years  
All our tears  
Still we sing the same old song  
Let's make right all that went wrong  
There's no beginning there's no end  
There is no reason to pretend  
Crying from help from above  
We've got to save our love
