Now is the day  
We're on our way  
Leave all your cares behind  
Set your spirit free  
Just say goodbye  
Take to the sky  
We'll see what we can find  
Come away with me  
We can fly  
Fly away  
We will fly  
Lookin' for a dream  
See the stars above  
And the earth below us spinning  
Come with me my love  
And we'll find  
A new beginning  
We can fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Fly away  
(spread your wings and we'll fly away)  
We will fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Lookin' for a dream  
Stay by my side  
And we will ride  
Our silver charriot  
To the promisand land  
Don't be afraid  
We'll have it made  
With all the love we got  
Take me by the hand  
We can fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Fly away  
(spread our wings and we'll fly away)  
We will fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Lookin' for a dream  
Lookin' for a dream  
Lookin' for a dream
