Maybe it's imaginary, I'd like to know  
What's the world coming to and where will it go?  
The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in  
It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin  
And I don't know why, who will reveal?  
Maybe it's imaginary, maybe it's real  
We wash all the food and we peel off the skin  
But what is the point if it's poisoned within?  
Now I don't know why we say ok  
Maybe it's imaginary, hope it's not too late  
And when in the summer we go to the sea  
The things floating by aren't what we want to see  
And I'd change it all if I had one wish  
I'd never go swimming with those nuclear fish  
Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry  
But if it's true then I'd like to know why  
I don't know much but I'd like to know why
