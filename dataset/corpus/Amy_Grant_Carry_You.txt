[Chorus]  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child, my child  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child, my child  
  
Cause I can walk on water  
Calm a restless sea  
I've done a thousand things you've never done  
And I'm really watching  
While you struggle on your own  
Call my name, I'll come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I give vision to the blind  
I can raise the dead  
I've seen the darker side of hell  
And I've returned  
I've seen those sleepless nights  
And count every tear you cry  
Some lessons hurt to learn  
  
[Chorus]
