In this world I walk alone with no place to call my home  
But there's One who holds my hand  
The rugged road through barren lands  
The way is dark, the road is steep  
But He's become my eyes to see  
The strength to climb, my griefs to bear  
This Savior lives inside me there  
  
In Your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
  
In these trials of life I find  
Another Voice inside my mind  
He comforts me and bids me live  
Inside the love the Father gives  
  
In your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee
