All alone  
I must stand  
Even when I'm running  
And it feels, like a dream  
I need to awaken from  
  
I believe  
When it hurts  
We must keep on trying  
But I want, and I need  
Like a river needs the rain  
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave  
I just want to breathe again  
Like a summer's day I need to feel the heat again  
  
I only want to keep the stone from rolling  
I only want to learn to feel the rain  
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling  
I only want to learn to freeze the flame  
I know I'll be alive again  
I want to be alive again  
  
Here's the night, where are the stars 'cause I need some guiding  
And it cuts like a knife as I watch you walk away  
  
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave  
I just want to live again  
Like a stormy rain I need to hear it beat again  
  
I only want to keep the stone from rolling  
I only want to learn to feel the rain  
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling  
I only want to learn to freeze the flame  
I know I'll be alive again  
I want to be alive again  
I want to be alive again  
  
'Cause I did my best  
Baby who'd have guessed that I failed the test  
'Cause when love ain't blessed and it's laid to rest it can leave a mess  
  
I only want to keep the stone from rolling  
I only want to learn to feel the rain  
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling  
I only want to learn to freeze the flame  
  
I only want to keep the stone from rolling  
I only want to learn to feel the rain  
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling  
I only want to learn to freeze the flame
