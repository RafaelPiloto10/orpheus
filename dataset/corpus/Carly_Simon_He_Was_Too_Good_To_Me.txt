There goes my young intended  
The thing has ended  
Regrets are vain  
I'll never find another half so sweet  
And we'll never meet again  
I got impatient  
Told him goodbye  
Sad eyes out in the rain  
  
He was too good to me  
How can I get along now  
So close he stood to me  
Everything seems all wrong now  
He would have brought me the sun  
Making me smile, that was his fun  
  
When I was mean to him  
He'd never say go away now  
I was a Queen to him  
Who's gonna make me gay now  
It's only natural that I'm blue  
He was too good to be true
