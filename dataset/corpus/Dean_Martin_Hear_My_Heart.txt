Hear my heart hear the sound it makes of love  
The sound that whispers I love only you  
Every beat seems to tell me that we'll meet  
Yet I know you're meeting someone new  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again
