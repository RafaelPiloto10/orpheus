Been there,done that.Every spot on the map.  
See these lines on my face and these bones out of place.  
I got dirt on my hat, been blessed and cussed at.  
No brag,just fact.Been there,done that.  
I wear old blue jeans.They got holes in the seams.  
I've got boots made of brass.Kicked a whole lot of,you know what I mean.  
I've been up and down,both sides of the town.  
I'm stating the facts.Been there,done that.  
Been there,done that.Every town on the map.  
See these lines on my face and these bones out of place.  
I got mud on my hat.I've been blessed and cussed at.  
I ain't no pussy cat.Been there,done that.  
Guess there's only one thing. Keeps a man like me going.  
Gets my attention right now.Well, you know what I'm talking about,  
A pretty green eyed queen dolled up in tight jeans.  
It makes my heart beat fast,'cause I've been there and done that.  
Been there,done that.Every joint on the map.  
See these lines on my face and these guitar pickin' fingers way out of place.  
I got mud on my hat.I've been blessed and cussed at.  
Don't put up with no crap.  
Been there,done that
