You might see me down in Alabama  
Or Baton Rouge down in Louisiana  
I might make it up to Detroit City  
Where people work hard and life is gritty  
It don't really matter where I am  
It's what I do and what I can  
This old world has been good to me  
So I try to give back and I want to be free  
  
I was born in Ontario  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario  
  
I still like to sing a happy song  
Once in a while when things go wrong  
I might pick up a pen, scribble on a page  
Try to make sense of my inner rage  
One cold winter we went down south  
With daddy's typewriter for a couple of months  
  
But I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario  
  
I was born in Ontario  
Where the black fly bites  
And the green grass grows  
That's where I learned most of what I know  
'Cause you don't learn much when you start to get old  
I left home at a tender young age  
Mom and daddy never liked to stay  
In any one place for very long  
We just kept moving, moving on  
  
But I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario
