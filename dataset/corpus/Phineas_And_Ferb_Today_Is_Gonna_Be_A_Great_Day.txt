There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation,  
'Till school comes along just to end it,  
So the annual problem for our generation,  
Is finding a good way to spend it  
Like maybe...  
  
Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy,  
Or climbing up the Eiffel tower,  
Discovering something that doesn't exist,  
Or giving a monkey a shower  
Surfing tidal waves, creating nano-bots,  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain,  
Finding a Dodo bird, painting a continent,  
Or driving our sister insane  
  
This could possibly be the best day ever,  
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times
better,  
So make every minute count jump up, jump in and seize the day,  
And let's make sure that in every single possible way,  
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!  
  
Crossing the tundra or building a roller coaster.  
Skiing down a mountain of beans,  
Devising a system for remembering everything,  
Or synchronizing submarines, racing chariots,  
Taming tiger sharks, constructing a portal to mars,  
Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree, or wailing away on guitars,  
  
This could possibly be the best day ever,  
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times
better,  
So make every minute count to one,  
Jump in and seize the day,  
And let's make sure that in every single possible way,  
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!  
  
Let's put our heads together and design a master plan,  
We may miss dinner, but I know mom will understand...  
We got our mission and suppliers, purple gumballs and desires,  
A pocket full of rubber bands, the manual on handstands,  
A unicycle compass, and a camera that wont focus,  
And canteen full of soda, grab a beach towel here we go! (this is Ferb-tastic)  
  
This could possibly be the best day ever,  
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times
better,  
So make every minute count to one, jump in and seize the day,  
And let's make sure that in every single possible way  
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!  
  
(Seriously this is gonna be great day)  
  
This could possibly be the best day ever (Today's Gonna be a Great Day)  
This could possibly be the best day ever (Today's Gonna be a Great Day)
