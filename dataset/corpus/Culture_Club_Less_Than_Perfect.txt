I know a song ain't good enough to let you know how I feel  
I'll sing it hard, I'll sing it sweet, to let you know that it's real  
If I change my attitude, maybe I can conquer you completely  
All the things I say and do, everything I learn from you defeats me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
  
I know it's wrong to blame the past for everything that I do  
I fool the world most of the time but there's no fooling you  
If I change my attitude, maybe I can conquer you completely  
Everything I say and do, all I learn from you defeat me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
Let you down  
  
What you see ain't always what you get  
No matter how clear it seems  
One minute lovers, then the next  
  
Oh oh no  
Oh no  
  
I let you down, yeah yeah  
I let you down [Repeat: x5]  
Let you down  
Let you down
