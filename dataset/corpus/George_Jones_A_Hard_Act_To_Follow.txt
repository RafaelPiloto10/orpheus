Well I can see you're advertisin' cause you keep givin' me the eye  
It won't take long till your in my song I want to be with you tonight  
I've been battlin' needin' bookin's and you the best contract I've known  
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep comin' on  
  
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage  
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage  
Just one more big rehearsal another night with you alone  
And I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on  
  
Well the introductions over we got our hearts in tune  
Let me know before we start the show am I fallin' in love to soon  
I got a heart nearly as big as Texas about the size of the astrodome  
And I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on  
  
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage  
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage  
I don't want no double feature cause my heart just thinks that wrong  
But I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on  
Yeah I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on
