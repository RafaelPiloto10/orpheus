A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H  
I got a gal in Kalamazoo  
Don't want to boast, but I know  
She's the toast of Kalamazoo  
(Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo)  
  
Years have gone by  
My, my, how she grew  
I liked her looks  
When I carried her books in Kalamazoo  
(Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo)  
  
I'm gonna send a wire  
Hoppin' on a flyer, leavin' today  
Am I dreamin'?  
I can hear her screamin', "Hiya, Mr. Jackson"  
Everything's O.K., A-L-A-M-A-Z-O  
  
Oh, what a gal, a real pipperoo  
I'll make my bid  
For that freckle-faced kid I'm hurryin' to  
I'm goin' to Michigan  
To see the sweetest gal in Kalamazoo  
(Zoo, zoo)  
(Zoo, zoo, zoo, Kalamazoo)  
  
K-(K)-A-(A)-L-A-M-A-Z-O  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a gal, a real pipperoo  
We're goin' to Michigan  
To see the sweetest gal in Kalamazoo  
Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo  
Kalamazoo
