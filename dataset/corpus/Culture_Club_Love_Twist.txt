Footsteps, movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys, they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
I'll be gone before you know  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I cry  
Let me be told  
Or give me something  
That I can hold  
  
Rhythms take me  
Do I need it  
Will we kiss, will you let go  
Twisting hearts  
Oh how we bleed them  
How am I supposed to throw  
Memories from where I keep them  
Words will only make us slow  
We are brave on the assumption  
She'll be back  
Before you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Footsteps, movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
I'll be gone before you know  
  
[Chorus]
