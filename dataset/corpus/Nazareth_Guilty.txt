Yes baby, I've been drinkin'  
Shouldn't come by anymore  
But I found myself in trouble darlin'  
And I have no place else to go.  
  
I got some whiskey, from a bottle  
Got some cocaine, from a friend  
And I had to keep on movin' darlin'  
Till I was back in your arms again.  
  
And I'm guilty, I am guilty  
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life  
  
How come I'm never gonna do  
What I'm supposed to do  
Seems like everything I do  
Never turns out right  
  
That's how it is with me darlin'  
You know I just can't stand myself  
But it takes a whole lot of medicine darlin'  
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else.
