Vicious words drift away from their meanings  
And the sun melts the chill from our lives  
Helping us all to remember what we came here for  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
  
Little things that will change you forever  
May appear from out of the blue  
Making fools of everybody who don't understand  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
  
This is love, this is love  
This is love, this is la la la la love  
  
Since our problems have been our own creation  
They also can be overcome  
When we use the power provided free to everyone  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
  
This is love  
This is la la la la love  
This is love  
This is la la la la love
