Money isn't everything, ask anyone who's rich  
It can buy pain and misery or grief  
Though money isn't everything  
I have a pauper's itch, so though I crave a brave  
Yes, I'll take the chief!  
  
He bought me a cat, Siamese, imagine that  
He keeps making, fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
Oh joy, now I've got sixty feet of brand new yacht  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
He owns New York or Spain but I don't know which  
He got fat in Uptown Manhattan  
Poor Cinderella's got her a fella who's rich  
Every penny, he's worth a plenty  
  
He owns United Airlines, that as well?  
He owns receding hairlines, oh, well  
He's not so hip or smart as a whip  
But healthy, wise and wealthy  
  
He bought me a summer place  
Somewhere out in outer space  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
  
What a man you've got, Diane  
Did he buy you a mink? Passion pink  
And a Cadi too? Baby blue  
You're speaking of? My baby love  
Your Romeo? My Daddy Dough  
I love him a lot, how much has he got?  
  
He's got a plot of ground, he found over oil  
Oh, my how chic we are  
He bought New Jersey  
So he could call me his girl  
Oh, man, a feat we are  
  
Chocolate excites my tummy  
He bought me a firm called Yummy  
So, he's one of those gents  
With good bizness cents  
And quarters, half's and dollars  
  
Ding, dong, ain't it swell  
They just delivered the liberty bell  
How sad all those Philadelphians will be  
  
I'll get half of what he owns  
To keep up with Mrs. L. B. Jones  
And if he keeps making fancy passes  
I'll start holding evening classes  
  
I'll give him sugar and molasses  
And the life, I live, I'll live luxuriously  
From those late and evening classes  
That sugar and molasses  
Those fine and fancy passes at me  
My honey, yeah
