Picture me big time  
Up along the range  
With this woman of mine  
Driving me insane  
  
Parasites baby....  
Don't you know  
I can't lie to you  
  
There was a band from Beantown  
They drove the now sound  
With a girl at the top of her lungs now  
Yeah, a girl at the top of her lungs  
  
She'd tell the people baby  
The world will settle down for no one  
I will deliver to you  
  
To one another in every place  
Who speak like brothers  
And leave no trace  
Of a world still divided by tongues  
Yeah, the world's still divided by tongues  
  
You want to keep it closer now,  
don't you  
But there are words that speak to everyone  
Which I will deliver to you  
I will deliver to you  
I will deliver to you
