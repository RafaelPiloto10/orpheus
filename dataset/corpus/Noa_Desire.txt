With the breaking of the dawn  
I will peek beyond the glass  
There' s an endless stretch of blue below  
An ocean cold and vast  
I am traveling again  
Between the heavens and the clouds  
Reaching out, turning a vision  
Into a future, strong and proud  
  
But I say, oh, there' s nothing more I desire  
Than to spend my life with you  
Setting me gently on fire.  
  
We' re a very special two  
Only you can understand  
Walking parallel, on separate paths,  
But always holding hands.  
As we lay our yellow bricks  
On the road to something better  
Can we find a point of meeting  
And continue on together?  
  
And I say, oh, - there' s nothing more I desire  
Than to spend my life with you  
Setting me gently on fire.
