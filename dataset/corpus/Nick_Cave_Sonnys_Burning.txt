Have you heard how Sonny's burning  
Like some bright erotic star?  
And He lights up the proceedings  
And raises the temperature.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
  
  
Now I've seen to Sonny's burning  
Someday I think I'll cut him down  
But it can get so cold in here  
And he gives off such an evil heat.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Hail my incubatic incubator.  
  
  
Now pay witness to Sonny's burning  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
That blooms into the DEMON FLOWER  
Now both fire and flowers consume me.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
  
  
Evil heat is running through me  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Sonny's burning pits into me  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Sonny's burning holes into me  
Don't interrupt! Don't interrupt!  
Flame on! Flame on!
