And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break  
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take  
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye  
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh  
Sometimes he cry  
When he think about his girlfriend on his side  
She held him down, she made him better  
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather  
And she thinkin about her life  
With no more work just being a wife  
But instead her love, she gave it to a man  
Who fought against her lovely plans  
So when she go to work, plus go to school  
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool  
She want the ease that come after pain  
She fights for love, thats her campaign  
We fight, we love  
  
We fight and love so much  
Sometimes I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
We fight and love so much  
Sometimes I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
We just keep on  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
And it, and it begins, he's off the ball  
He left his friends, he ain't home no more  
He's in a place, that's far away  
Where he can't understand what they say  
They say salaam, they cary bombs  
In crouded places, and cause alarm  
You're the infidel who's uninvited  
But really an American boy who's slighted  
It ain't your fault, you want identity  
So you join this big fraternity  
You get to travel the world, its cheaper than college  
And you get guns and you get knowledge  
Lookin for your soul, and WMD's  
You can't find nothing, cause its empty  
You got your gun, and he's your friend  
And he's your man, until the end  
We fight, we love  
  
We fight and love so much sometimes  
I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
We fight and love so much sometimes  
I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
We just keep on  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit
