How could you tell me that you love me  
When I know you were just trying to play me  
But you're the fool  
'Cause I know how to switch the game up on you  
And in the end I know who will lose  
I played this game before  
And I can't play no more  
  
What do you take me for  
It's not what you thought  
So don't play games with me  
'Cause I play to teach  
And if you want to cheat  
It won't be on me  
  
It's not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasn't that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
It's not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasn't that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Who did you think that you were involved with  
Now baby you should know that it ain't that serious  
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you  
So that should let you know that what you do  
  
I have done before, it's nothing new  
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled  
I can almost see lies coming through your teeth  
In every word you speak you make it clear to me  
That you're playing wrong and your game ain't strong  
I've been in this too long, so just be moving on  
  
It's not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasn't that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
It's not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasn't that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Don't play games with my heart  
I will let you go before you start  
  
It's not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasn't that I loved you  
I was curious
