All the miles of glory really nothing to me  
It's our love here, we are invisble again  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
And searching for so long, it will stay with me forever  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
No religion and choruses again  
But it won't leave me desolate and angry  
Are there no poets in politics again  
  
See the window upon the free world closing slowly  
And poor men crawl upon your boney knees again  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
And searching for so long, it will stay with me forever  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Holy roller and passion play again  
On this day that I don't care to remember  
No religion and choruses again  
  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
  
I feel lost as a dying rose in embers  
No religion and choruses again  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Are there no poets in politics again  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Holy roller and passion play again  
On this day that I don't care to remember  
No religion and choruses again
