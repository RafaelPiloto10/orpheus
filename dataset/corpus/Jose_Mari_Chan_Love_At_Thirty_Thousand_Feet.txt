Dreaming of love while cruising at high altitude  
Dreaming of making love with you the way we should  
Closer to heaven. We're thirty thousand feet, up in the sky  
Here among the stars, our spirits will fly  
  
Leave all your worries as we soar over the clouds  
Jet lag that's making you appear far from the crowd  
While we're suspended, locked in each others, sweet embrace  
We'll be shooting star through time and space
