The situation's got me rattled  
I twist and turn late at night  
This whole world's up in shambles  
Who's the one to make it right  
  
Missing persons lost in action (action)  
Forgotten victims of the night (victims of the night)  
They're making crime the main attraction (attraction)  
They're making everyone uptight  
They're all looking for a fight  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense  
  
You'll take your chances, Mr. Policeman (policeman)  
You're like a cat with thirteen lives (cat with thirteen lives)  
Your law and order is our lifeline (lifeline)  
Through the danger, you'll survive  
I do what I need to stay alive  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense  
  
In self (self) defense  
In self (self) defense  
  
In this confusion from day to day  
Sometimes fear just makes no sense  
In this crossfire I see one way  
In self defense
