Madness comes, and madness goes  
An insane place, with insane moves  
Battles without, for battles within  
Where evil lives and evil rules  
Breaking them up, just breaking them in  
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins  
Never disclose, never betray  
Cease to speak or cease to breathe  
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer  
Kill many, and you're a conqueror  
Kill them all... Ooh... Oh you're a god!  
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"  
"Yes we have you honor, we find the defendant guilty on all counts for crimes  
against all humanity."  
"By virtue of the jury's decision and the power vested in me by the state,  
I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole, for  
life."  
"Life? Whale' ya' mean life? I ain't got a life!"  
"Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus, Hmmm-mmm, 'cause your ass belongs to  
me!"  
Captive honour, ain't no honour  
No time for questions  
No time for games  
Start kicking ass  
And taking down the names  
A long shit list  
A shorter fuse  
He is untouchable  
And guarantees you'll lose  
Inside the bighouse  
His nightmare unfolds  
Before he got there  
His manpussy was sold  
Black blanket welcome  
This tough guy's now a bitch  
Praying for death  
It can't be worse than this
