Everything is slower here, everybody's got a union card  
They get up on Sunday, go to church of their choice  
Come back home, cook out in the backyard  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where the cornfields grow and flow  
They're all 5 years ahead of their time  
Or 25 behind, I just don't know  
  
And all the young men talk about their 4 wheel drives  
How much money they're gonna make on Friday night  
And they like to brag about how they mistreat their girlfriends  
Hey, let's get drunk, party it up, start a fight  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Sure make a hell of a car  
And the old hearts, they race their way through the night  
The upheaval of who they really are  
  
Growin' up under normal conditions, television and radio  
That's just about all of this whole world  
That any of us get to see, get to know  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where you sacrifice body and soul  
No one really wants to get even  
Most of us find it hard enough just lettin' go  
  
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining  
I ain't braggin', nor do I mean to place blame  
That's just the way things are around here  
And there's a future carryin' my name on it  
  
Sayin' hey man, you gonna stick around here you better get on it  
If you're gonna stick around here  
You better make yourself some real good friends  
  
Well, I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth  
So I can't talk about the big city hi-life  
You wanna talk about bein' bored and runnin'  
Away from yourself, hell, I can talk to you all night  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where livin' is just gettin' by  
And people, they trade in their happiness  
For a smokestack, a big money deal in the sky
