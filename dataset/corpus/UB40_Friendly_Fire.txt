We were partners in crime  
Spending our days, serving our time  
In the usual way  
We went behind the lines  
To even the score  
I won the battle but you won the war  
I used to be a gun for hire  
Then I was killed by friendly fire  
I used to be a real high flier  
Then I was killed by friendly fire  
  
A shot rang out  
And knocked me flat  
Ain't no coming back from a lick like that  
I never saw it coming, it came out of the blue  
I never did believe my assassin would be you  
  
I got the message down the wire  
That I was killed by friendly fire  
I used to be a gun for hire  
Then I was killed by friendly fire
