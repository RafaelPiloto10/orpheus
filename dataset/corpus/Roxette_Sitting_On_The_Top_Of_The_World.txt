Hey, I paid my dues, I've had my share of holes in the shoes.  
I'm glad it's so forgotten.  
I love it when you free to spoil me rotten, those little things you know,  
night shopping for a soul to go.  
  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world, I want this to be real.  
  
Coming out of my cage, made of steal,  
God I know, it's final.  
Decided to release my love on vinyl.  
Those little things you show, you kissed the wind, you let it blow.  
  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it, and I like it.  
  
Flip right through a magazine, bottle neck, a tambourine.  
Light a candle at the show swinging high and low.  
  
I'm watching the dawning  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And I like it, yeah  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
I'm watching the dawning  
I'm watching the dawning  
Like it  
I'm watching the dawning  
I'm sitting on the top of the world  
And i like it
