You push hard, you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love, I need my mental stimulation  
  
If I'm not there, defend my reputation  
Well, that don't mean that there's a real negotiation  
Take a longer look, this could be privacy invasion  
What makes you think you've got that fascination?  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I know you're burnin' with anticipation  
Hold on, here comes your education  
Make sure it's love not just infatuation  
Tell me why you always lead me to that destination  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
  
You push hard, you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love, I need my mental stimulation  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I need some space  
I need some space  
I need some space
