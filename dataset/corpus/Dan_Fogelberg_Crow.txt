Somewhere on a lonely muddy country road  
I heard your song, crow, for the first time  
Somewhere in the distance wicked, black and low  
  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Some say she died of drowning in the river deep  
Some say she died of a sudden start  
  
Some say they found her swinging from my old man's tree  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
I can't believe they would pay men just to hunt me down  
  
But silver coins to each one do they give  
And by now there's a gallows standing in the town  
And I wonder how much more I have to live  
And I wonder how much more I have to live  
  
Somewhere on a lonely muddy country road  
I heard your song, crow, for the last time  
Somewhere in the distance wicked, black and low  
  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime
