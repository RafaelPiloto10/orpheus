Love is gentle as a rose  
And love can conquer any war  
It's time to take a stand  
Brothers and sisters join hands  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
Love transcends all space and time  
And love can make a little child smile  
Can't you see this won't go wrong  
But we got to be strong  
We can't do it alone  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule
