Do you feel this?  
I'm gonna feel this  
Are you ready?  
I don't think so  
  
Somebody give me my truck  
So I can ride on the clouds  
So I can turn up the pace...like  
  
Somebody pass my guitar  
So I can look like a star  
And spend the cash like  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh"  
Why you standing on the wall?  
Music's starting everywhere!  
So why don't you just move along?  
  
Chorus:  
I see you looking at me  
Like I'm some kind of a freak  
Get up out of your seat  
Why don't you do something?  
  
I see you looking at me  
Like I got what you need  
Get up out of your seat  
Why don't you do something?  
  
Now you all in my grill  
Cause I say what I feel  
Only rock to what's real  
  
But I can't do that with you  
I'll be here with my crew  
You can roll if you want  
Don't be a bum bum!!!  
  
Pre chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
I see you lookin over here  
Can't you tell I'm having fun?  
If you know it like I know  
You would stop!!!  
Let's turn it up!!  
And get you into space  
And do something!!!  
  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Fuck!!!  
Do something!!!  
Why don't you do something?!
