Never Lost  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
They saw the clouds on the horizon  
Nobody seemed to be concerned  
Jesus said they must cross the water  
Now He was sleeping in the stern  
Quick as the flash of summer lightning  
Caught on a sea of crashing waves  
Waking Him up and crying, Save us!  
They didn't need to be afraid  
CHORUS:  
Never lost  
He knows where you're going  
Never lost  
Even though the wind is blowing  
And there may be some stormy seas  
He says you must cross  
But with Jesus at your side  
You're never lost  
We used to rise and face the morning  
Like it was just another day  
But now we know that without warning  
How quickly everything can change  
It's like we're standing in a doorway  
And what lies beyond we cannot see  
As we step into the next moment  
Or into eternity  
CHORUS  
Mountains crumble  
And crash into the sea  
Kings and kingdoms do the same  
But if we place our trust  
In what we cannot see  
Our faith in Jesus will remain  
CHORUS (repeat)  
Never lost
