Stand down, yeah  
Stand down, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Got to let it, ooh yeah  
Gotta do it, yeah, yeah, oh yeah  
  
Friends and lovers beware  
'Cause there's something in the air  
I feel it coming, I feel it coming  
And I'm talking to you all  
'Cause when that hammer starts to fall  
There'll be no running, there'll be no running  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, ooh yeah, stand down, yeah  
  
It is written in the sky  
There's no place for you and I  
To keep on strumming, no strumming  
In the message that we send  
They're gonna tell us in the end  
That we had it coming, we had it coming  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you want, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
  
If all the things that we possess  
The most important is tenderness  
Too cold when that wind blows today  
And bitterness is the easy way  
  
Stand down low  
Stand down  
Got to, got to need  
You got to  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
  
Stand down  
(Stand)  
Stand down  
(Stand)  
Stand down
