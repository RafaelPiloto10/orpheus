DJ I want everybody to stop what they're doing.  
Now if you know you're with somebody you're gonna take the hotel room tonight,  
Make some noise  
  
Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room  
Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room  
  
[Chorus]  
Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,  
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room.  
Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,  
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room.  
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.  
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.  
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.
