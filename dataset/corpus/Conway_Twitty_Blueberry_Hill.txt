I found my thrill  
Yes, On Blueberry hill  
On Blueberry hill  
Woo, When I found you.  
  
My heart stood still  
Right there on Blueberry hill  
You know it ain't good until  
All my dreams came true.  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
And all of those vows we made  
Are never to be.  
  
Though we're apart  
You know I dream of you still  
Cause you were my thrill  
On Blueberry hill.  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
And all of those vows we made  
Are never to be.  
  
Though we're apart  
You know I dream of you still  
Cause you were my thrill  
Down on Blueberry hill
