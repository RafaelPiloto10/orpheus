[Verse 1]  
I have been broken I have been bruised,  
I've had my battles and I've been accused,  
But still I will trust You, Still I will go.  
Withholding nothing from you God  
So here I stand with my heart open wide with my hands lifted up I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
I surrender all to You,  
I surrender my soul to You,  
I surrender over to Your will.  
I surrender my mind to You,  
I surrender my heart to You.  
I surrender completely to Your will.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Here I am giving my all  
I need You Lord to break through my walls.  
I give You my life, I give You my all.  
I'm ready for You to revive my soul  
So here I stand with my heart open wide withy my hands lifted up I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
I surrender all to You,  
I surrender my soul to You,  
I surrender over to Your will.  
I surrender my mind to You,  
I surrender my heart to You.  
I surrender completely to Your will.  
  
[Bridge]  
Take my pride, take my fear, take my life  
I surrender to Your will, to Your way, to Your plan I surrender. (X8)  
  
[Outro]  
I surrender (X4)  
  
[Ending]  
I surrender all to You, I surrender my soul to You  
I surrender over to You Lord.
