When a cowboy loves a cowgirl  
They attract together  
But when a forcefield breaks them apart  
They won't survive forever  
It's like "It's over", We're done", "Forget about me"  
It's like "My first boy friend already dumped me"  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
  
At our first wedding  
You took the flowers from the vase  
You hit me with those flowers  
And I hit you with your case  
It's like "I don't", It's over", "I was wrong"  
The relationship is why I'm writing this song  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
It's a country thing  
When I write a song for you,  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
  
It's like "I don't wanna be with you"  
It's like "We're done and over this time"  
It's like "We don't have nothing in common"  
It's like Uh... I ran out of rhymes  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
It's a country thing  
When I write a song for you,  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
Hillbilly Love  
Hillbilly Love
