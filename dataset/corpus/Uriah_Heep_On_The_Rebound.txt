On the rebound, on the rebound  
That's how you fell for me  
That's how you changed my life  
You cut me like a knife  
  
On the rebound, on the rebound  
You came, you saw, you took  
It only took one look  
And lady, I was hooked  
  
On the rebound, it's a replay  
Your love was on the rebound  
On the rebound  
You came and took my soul  
You came and left a hole  
Where your love used to be  
  
On the rebound, on the rebound  
You like to drown in your tears  
And after all these years  
You give your pain to me  
  
On the rebound, you came to me, babe  
On the rebound, to set you free  
On the rebound, too bad for me  
Your love was on the rebound  
  
You came to me  
To set you free  
To pray for me  
It's a replay  
You came to repay  
It's a replay  
To set you free  
Just a replay  
Your love was  
Just a replay
