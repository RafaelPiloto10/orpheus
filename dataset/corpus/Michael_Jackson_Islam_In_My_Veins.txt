Miles away, oceans apart  
Never been my sight always in my heart  
The love is always there it will never die  
Only growing stronger tears down my eye  
I am thinking all the time  
When the day will come  
Standing there before you  
Accept this Hajj of mine  
Standing in ihram, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall  
I feel alive and I feel strong  
  
I can feel Islam running in my Veins  
To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same  
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name  
I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim.  
That they remember you in everything they say  
Standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall
