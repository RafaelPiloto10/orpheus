Let there be you, let there be me,  
Let there be oysters under the sea,  
Let there be wind and occasional rain,  
Chilli Con Carne and sparkling champagne,  
  
Let there be birds to sing in the trees,  
Someone to bless me, whenever I sneeze,  
Let there be Cuckoos, a lark and a dove,  
But first of all please, let there be love.  
  
Let there be Cuckoos, a lark and a dove,  
But first of all please, let there be love  
Love.. ooh.. love.. let there be love
