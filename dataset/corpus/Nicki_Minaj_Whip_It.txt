Hey, you, jump in this ride  
It's real nice, and slippery inside  
Rise, eyes, come get this pie, ride it style  
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago  
I drop it, I pick it slow, I want it, I kick it though  
Cause they know that I got that Gucci  
Said I'm bad, but I could be a Gucci  
  
Please my body, rock my body, roll, you make me go  
Na na na na na me go  
Please my body, heal my body roll, you make me go  
Na na na na na me go, we gon'  
  
Hey stranger over there  
I'm really liking that way  
You whip it whip it  
Yeah, I want you everyday  
You're so right, you're so tight  
You got my world spinning  
You got my world spinning  
My head goes round and around, round and around  
Now I'm thinking  
If we could be, stranger what you say?  
I'm really liking that way  
You whip it whip it whip it whip it  
  
Na na na na na me go  
Na na na na na me go  
  
Is that my cue? I'm looking for some brain to boost my IQ  
I'm like 5'2, my SAT scores was high too  
But I don't mean to brag I Louis Vuitton bag em  
Hopped out the jag proceeded to sha shag em  
Slim, trim, oh so light skin  
So pe pe peter put the pipe in  
  
Please my body, rock my body, roll, you make me go  
Na na na na na me go  
Please my body, heal my body roll, you make me go  
Na na na na na me go, we gon'
