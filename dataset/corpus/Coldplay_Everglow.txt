Oh, they say people come  
They say people go  
This particular diamond was extra special  
  
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know  
Still I see you celestial  
  
Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled  
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple  
  
So how come things move on?  
How come cars don't slow?  
When it feels like the end of my world  
When I should but I can't let you go  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
When I'm cold, cold  
There's a light that you give me  
When I'm in shadow  
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow  
  
Like the brothers in blood, sisters who ride  
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died  
But the changing of winds and the way waters flow  
Life as short as the falling snow  
Now I'm going to miss you, I know  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
In water rolled, salt  
I know that you're with me, and the way you will show  
And you're with me wherever I go  
And you give me this feeling, this everglow  
  
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold  
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow  
  
So if you love someone you should let them know  
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
