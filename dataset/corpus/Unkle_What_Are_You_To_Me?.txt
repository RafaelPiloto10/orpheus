(Day dream... day dream...)  
Day dream...(day dream...)  
  
So many times I've overflowed  
So many faces come and go  
I play my cards into the sun  
And try to work out  
What you are to me  
  
To me  
  
Been here before  
A million open doors  
Only one will set me free  
So I fall against the wall  
And try to work out  
What you are to me, to me, to me, to me...  
  
To me...  
  
Inside my eyes  
The answer lies  
Something I can't see  
Another day  
Another way  
It's the same to me, to me  
  
To me..., to me..., to me...  
  
(what's wrong?)  
  
To me... (to me...)  
To me... (to me...)  
To me... (to me...)  
To me... (to me...)
