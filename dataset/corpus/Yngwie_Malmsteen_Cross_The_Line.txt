I'm not the one  
Who's runnin' round and bein' snakey  
I'm not the one who's got it down  
Time after time  
I try not actin' crazy  
With you, that's not an easy thing to do  
  
So I'm pleadin'  
  
Maybe it's time  
Don't tell me, don't tell me  
To draw the line, don't tell me it's time  
  
Day after day  
You talk to me in circles  
I don't believe your little smile  
I'm not the one  
The one who's thinkin' crazy  
I won't be walkin' down no aisle  
  
So I'm pleadin'  
  
Maybe it's time  
Don't tell me, don't tell me  
To draw the line, maybe it's time
