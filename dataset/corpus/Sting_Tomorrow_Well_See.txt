The streets are wet  
The lights have yet  
To shed their tawdry lustre on the scene  
My skirt's too short  
My tights have run  
These new heels are killing me  
My second pack of cigarettes  
It's a slow night but there's time yet  
Here comes John from his other life  
He may be driving to his wife  
But he'll slow down take a look  
I've learned to read them just like books  
And it's already half past ten  
But they'll be back again  
Headlights in the rainy street  
I check, make sure it's not the heat  
I wink, I smile, I wave my hand  
He stops and seems to understand  
The small transaction we must make  
I tell him that my heart will break  
If he's not a generous man  
I step into his van  
They say the first is the hardest trick  
And after that it's just a matter of logic  
They have the money I have the time  
Being pretty's my only crime  
You ask what future do I see  
I say it's really up to me  
I don't need forgiving  
I'm just making a living  
Don't judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances  
And tomorrow we'll see  
A friend of mine he wound up dead  
His dress was stained the colour red  
No next of kin no fixed abode  
Another victim on this road  
The police just carted him away  
But someone took his place next day  
He was home by thanksgiving  
But not with the living  
Don't judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances  
And no it's just not in my plan  
For someone to care who I am  
I'm walking the streets for money  
It's the business of love, 'hey honey'  
C'mon, don't leave me lonely, don't leave me sad  
It'll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had  
Don't judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances  
And tomorrow we'll see
