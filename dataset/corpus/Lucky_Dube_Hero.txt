Hero  
Do you see the smiles on their faces  
after you have done what you do best  
do you see satisfaction on their faces  
after you have blessed themw ith your gift  
you don't think iit's much  
but to them it means the world  
they wake up in the morning and wish you were there  
don't have to lie to gain their trust  
you have never won a Nobel prize  
they have never seen you on the TV  
your little contribution makes their lives a little bit better every day  
chorus  
you're a hero, you're a hero  
big it up, big it up  
for the fireman  
big it up, big it up  
for the street cleaners  
big it up for the man ad the woman who take care of abandonded children  
big it up, big it up  
for the grandmothers  
who are left to take care of the children  
big it up, big it up Wo!!
