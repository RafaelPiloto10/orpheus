Suddenly, you get a crazy feeling  
Then in harmony  
I won't be trading places  
Now you're history,  
Forget the time I let you play  
Your mystery 'n' I don't know  
  
Happy from the start  
Then ripped and torn apart  
Looking for a place within your heart  
  
Cold, cold heart  
Not like the stars that shine so bright  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
Don't you remember  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
  
Close to me you're taking out the boy in me  
Your chemistry  
Frightens all the life from me  
Your honesty  
Sometimes ain't so good  
For your mystery 'n' I don't know  
  
Happy from the start  
Then ripped and torn apart  
Looking for a place within your heart  
  
Cold, cold heart  
Not like the stars that shine so bright  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
Don't you remember  
Cold, cold heart  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
  
Love's for nothing but you try to get much more  
Looking for something you never had before  
The words left unspoken  
Just walked right out the door for evermore  
For evermore  
  
The magic that love brings  
The magic, oh,  
That lights the stars so bright  
Shine so bright  
Yeah, gonna tell the world I love her  
Gonna tell the world I love her  
  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
Don't you remember  
Cold, cold heart  
Shine so bright  
Cold, cold heart of mine  
Don't you remember  
Cold, cold heart, Yeah
