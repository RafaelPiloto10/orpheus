[Verse]  
If I had it my way, I would take you down  
If I had it my way, I would turn you out  
And if my body had a say, I would come again  
Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
[Verse]  
If I had it my way, I would take the lead  
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep  
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest  
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
[Bridge]  
My mind's getting in the way  
Can't feel what my body say  
I'mma tell you anyway  
I'mma tell you anyway  
My mind's getting in the way  
Can't feel what my body say  
I'mma show you anyway  
I'mma show you anyway  
  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
Oh, you can  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Dreamland  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to
