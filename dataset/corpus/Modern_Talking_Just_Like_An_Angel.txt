City lights spinning in my head  
Here comes the night and go to bed  
I'm sitting here in that night cafe  
My love won't go away  
Neverending dreams of you  
Lonely hours passing through  
Still missing you  
Where will you go, tonight?  
  
Just like an angel, you are  
Hotline to heaven, you're my star  
Just like an angel, in the night  
Ice in the fire, melt in the light  
  
Just like an angel  
Waiting for you  
Let me down easy  
Like angels do  
You're my angel  
Oh call on me  
Give me high, high energy  
  
I cross the streets to a telephone  
Shadows dancing - still on my own  
I'm sitting here in that night cafe  
My love won't go away  
Cafe is empty, the night goes by  
A million stars shine in the sky  
Still missing you, where will you go tonight ?
