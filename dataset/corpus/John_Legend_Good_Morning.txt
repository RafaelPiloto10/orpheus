Good morning,  
Good morning love,  
It's my favorite love song,  
I waited all night long,  
  
Before you get into the shower,  
Before you worry about your hair,  
Baby give me one more hour,  
I want you to stay right there,  
I don't wanna lose a moment,  
I don't wanna miss a kiss,  
If I could plan the perfect day, love,  
Then I would start it just like this  
  
[Chorus]  
Good morning,  
Good morning love,  
It's my favorite love song,  
I waited all night long,  
For morning,  
Good morning love  
Before we start the day dear,  
I'm whispering in your ear,  
Good morning.  
  
Now baby how can I commence you,  
I'll make it so you can't resist,  
Whatever else you have to do now,  
It can't be half as good as this,  
I'll case you underneath the sheets, love,  
And I won't let you get away,  
The day won't be complete, love,  
Unless we get a chance to say,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open your eyes,  
See my sunrise,  
I feel your skin  
So warm inside,  
Day breaks so sweet,  
When you're next to me,  
So stay each night,  
So each morning will be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's get lost together,  
I will smile forever [Repeat: x2]  
Was morning
