Can I introduce myself?  
I'm a man of panache and wealth  
Sound in mind, body, soul and health  
Why I wanna kill my wife?  
I have this urge to take her life  
  
Been planing for years to get rid of her  
Not divorce, I really do mean to kill her  
She's so full of useless information and trivia  
That's why I wanna kill my wife  
I have a duty to take her life  
  
Her stupid friends get right up my nose  
They all wear annoyingly sensible clothes  
They're all so bleeding grandiose  
You know why I should kill her friends  
They're all driving Mercedes Benz  
  
He'll escape down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore  
  
Should I string her up or strangle her in bed?  
Suffocate that little venomous head  
Or perhaps I'll just whip her to death  
Listen, do me a favor, kill my wife  
  
Do it for mankind, take her life  
Or should I act quite cold and deliberate  
Or maybe blow out her brains with a bullet?  
They'll think suicide, they won't know who done it  
I'm gonna kill my wife, I'm really gonna take her life  
  
He'll escape down into Mexico  
Go down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
Find a nice young girl  
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work no more  
  
The moment of truth has come  
I'm at the point of no return  
I've got my hands locked round her throat  
I'm about to kill my wife  
  
Don't stop me now, I'm gonna take her life  
Too late now, I'm gonna kill my wife  
Can't help myself, I'm gonna take her life  
  
Telephone rang and he woke from his sleep  
His wife snoring soundly next to him  
It was all a very nasty dream
