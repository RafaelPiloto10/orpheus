Don't be afraid when you  
Walk through the dark  
Just when you feel that  
Your day fell apart  
Stay strong  
Keep holding on  
Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done  
Keep on lifted  
Keep on lifted  
  
I wish you everything  
That you could want  
Just when the day finds you  
Turned back to front  
Stay clear  
Rescue is near  
When you feel  
That you're drowned in despair  
Keep on lifted  
Keep on lifted  
  
You're a bird in the sky now baby  
Earthbound  
Feet on the ground  
Now you can find peace at last  
Now you can find peace at last
