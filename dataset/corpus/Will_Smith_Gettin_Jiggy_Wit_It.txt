On your mark ready set let's go  
Dance floor pro I know you know  
I go psycho when my new joint hit  
Just can't sit  
Got to get jiggy wit it, thats it  
Now honey honey come ride  
DKNY all up in my eye  
You gotta Prada bag with a lot a stuff in it  
Give it to your friend let's spin  
Everybody lookin' at me  
Glancin' the kid  
Wish you nig was dancin' the jig  
Here with this handsome kid  
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba  
I just bite it  
It's for the look I don't light it  
Illway the amay on the anceday orflay  
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay  
Yo my cardio is infinite  
Ha ha  
Big willie style's all in it  
  
Gettin jiggy wit it

What you want to ball with the kid  
Watch your step you might fall  
Trying to do what I did  
Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closa'  
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub  
No love for the haters  
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers  
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders  
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest  
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser  
DJ play another  
From the prince of this  
Your highness  
Only bad chicks ride in my whips  
South to the west to the east to the north  
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off  
Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop  
In the winter or the (summertime)  
I makes it hot  
  
Gettin jiggy wit 'em  
Na na na na na na na nana  
Na na na na nana  
Gettin jiggy wit it  
Na na na na na na na nana

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift  
Who's the kid in the drop  
Who else Will Smith  
Livin' that life some consider a myth  
Rock from south street to one two fifth  
Women used to tease me  
Give it to me now nice and easy  
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey  
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em  
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum  
Never see Will attackin' 'em  
I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em  
Flatten 'em  
Psyche  
Hittin' you thought I took a spill  
But I didn't  
Trust the lady of my life she hittin'  
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon  
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly  
You trying to flex on me  
Don't be silly  
  
Gettin jiggy wit it  
Na na na na na na na nana  
Na na na na nana  
Gettin jiggy wit it  
Na na na na na na na nana  
Na na na na nana  
Gettin jiggy wit it  
Na na na na na na na nana  
Na na na na nana
