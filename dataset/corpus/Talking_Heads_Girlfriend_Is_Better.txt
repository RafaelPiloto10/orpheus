I...Who took the money?  
Who took the money away?  
I...It's always showtime  
Here at the edge of the stage  
I, I, I, wake up and wonder  
What was the place, what was the name?  
We want to wait, but here we go again...  
  
I...takes over slowly  
But doesn't last very long  
I...no need to worry  
Evr'ything's under control  
O - you - T But no hard feelings  
What do you know? Take you away  
We're being taken for a ride again  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
She has the smoke in her eyes  
She's moving up, going right through my house  
She's ginna give me surprise  
Better than this, know that It's right  
I think you can if you like  
I git a girlfriend with bows in her hair  
And nothing is better than that  
  
Down, down in the basement  
We hear the sound of machines  
I, I, I'm driving in circles  
Come to my senses sometimes  
Why, why, why, why start it over?  
Nothing was lost, everything's free  
I don't care how impossible it seems  
  
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear  
Get closer to be far away  
Only one look and that's all that we need  
Maybe that's all that it takes  
All that it takes, all that it takes  
All that it takes, all that it takes  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And she goes wherever she likes. (there she goes...)  
  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
Now everyone's getting involved  
She's moving up going right through my heart  
We might not ever get caught  
Going right through (try to stay cool) going through, staying cool  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And nothing is better than you  
  
I got a girlfriend that's better that this  
And you don't remember at all  
As we get older and stop making sense  
You won't find her waiting long  
Stop making sense, stop making sense...stop making sense, making sense  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And nothing is better that this ( is it? )
