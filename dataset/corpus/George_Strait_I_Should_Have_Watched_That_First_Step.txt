I once had a love, a true and lasting love  
But the fool in me came out one night  
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes  
And she changed the night I stepped across the line  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
  
I watched her slip away a little more every day  
And my conscience couldn't live with all that pain  
She's growing colder since the day I told her  
And the love we had will never be the same  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
That first step did something to her mind
