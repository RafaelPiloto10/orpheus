You know I don't like you  
But you want to be my friend  
There are bodies on the ceiling  
And they are fluttering their wings  
It's OK, I'm angry  
But you'll never understand  
You dream of Michelangelo  
They hang above your hands  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know, she is not my friend  
And I know, cause there she goes  
Walking on my skin again  
  
And I can't see why  
You want to talk to me  
When your vision of America  
Is crystal and clean  
I wanna white bread life  
Just something ignorant in the rain  
But from the walls of Michelangelo  
I'm dangling again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Saturn on a line  
The sun afire of strings and wires  
Spin above my head and make it right  
Anytime you'd like, you can catch a sight  
Of angel eyes on emptiness and infinite  
And I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed  
I see God upon the ceiling  
I see angels overhead  
And he seems so close  
As he reaches out his hand  
We are never quite as close  
As we are led to understand  
  
And I know, she is not my friend  
And I know, cause there she goes walking walking walking  
And I know, she is not my friend  
And I know, cause there she goes  
Walking on my skin again and again  
On my mind  
Oh Lord no  
Yes she's walking on my skin again and again
