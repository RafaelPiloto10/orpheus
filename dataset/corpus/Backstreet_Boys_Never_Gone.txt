I really miss you  
There's something that I gotta say  
  
The things we did,  
the things we said,  
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.  
You showed me how to face the truth.  
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.  
  
Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.  
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are  
  
[Chorus]  
Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.  
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.  
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,  
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)  
Never Gone  
  
No, no, no  
  
I walk along these empty streets.  
There is not a second you're not here with me.  
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,  
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.  
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.  
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be  
  
Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.  
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.  
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,  
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)  
  
Never gone from me  
If there's one thing I believe  
I believe  
I will see you somewhere down the road again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
