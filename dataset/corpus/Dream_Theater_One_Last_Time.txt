It doesn't make any sense  
This tragic ending  
In spite of the evidence  
There's something still missing  
  
Heard some of the rumors told  
A taste of one's wealth  
Did Victoria wound his soul?  
Did she bid him farewell?  
  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
We slowly fade away  
  
Here I am inside his home  
It holds the many clues  
To my suspicions  
And as I'm standing here right now  
I'm finally shown what I have always known  
  
Coincidence I can't belive  
As my childhood dreams alowly come true  
  
Are these her memories  
Awakened through my eyes  
This house has brought back to life  
  
An open door  
I walk on through  
Into his bedroom  
  
Feeling as cold as outside  
The walls disappear  
To some woman who's screaming  
A man pleads forgiveness  
His words I cannot hear
