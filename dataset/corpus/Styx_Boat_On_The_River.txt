Take me back to my boat on the river  
I need to go down, I need to calm down  
Take me back to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out any more  
Time stands still as I gaze in her waters  
She eases me down, touching me gently  
With the waters that flow past my boat on the river  
So I don't cry out anymore  
  
Oh the river is wide  
The river it touches my life like the waves on the sand  
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base  
Where the frown on my face disappears  
Take me down to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out anymore  
  
Oh the river is deep  
The river it touches my life like the waves on the sand  
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base  
Where the frown on my face disappears  
Take me down to my boat on the river  
I need to go down  
Won't you let me go down  
Take me back to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out anymore  
And I won't cry out anymore  
And I won't cry out anymore
