Loosely, she pulls my hair  
Kept far in the back, making her own  
Stay in your home  
She don't lean on crutches  
Yeah, I am now old  
I know, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Sitting tattered and old, she is a whore  
I really don't want to hate  
Pleading lies in all the wrong ways  
  
She's, she is now old, now old, now old  
Now old, now old, now old  
  
We're seeing the hate  
Feeding her own along the way  
Keeping me in the back way, yeah  
Boiled and burned with all the gays  
  
Old, she's old, old  
  
Our last day's crop  
Fed her own mouth with a white lie  
Kept her along all the way  
Tearing along with all of our hate, go  
  
I'm old, I'm old  
  
So all we did was lie down  
And all we had to do is beg  
All we had to do was lie down  
She covered us with a rain coat  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
His old right wing ways  
Kept him along in all the wrong ways  
Glory hole, hole, hole  
Tearing along wherever I go  
  
She said now, back in the hole  
Back in the hole, back in the hole  
Back in the hole, back in the hole  
Back in the hole, back in the hole
