Once I was a soldier  
And I fought on foreign sands for you  
Once I was a hunter  
And I brought home fresh meat for you  
Once I was a lover  
And I searched behind your eyes for you  
And soon there'll be another  
To tell you I was just a lie  
  
And sometimes I wonder  
Just for a while  
Will you remember me  
  
And though you have forgotten  
All of our rubbish dreams  
I find myself searching  
Through the ashes of our ruins  
For the days when we smiled  
And the hours that ran wild  
With the magic of our eyes  
And the silence of our words  
  
And sometimes I wonder  
Just for a while  
Will you remember me
