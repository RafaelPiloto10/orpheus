Tomorrow mornin' if you wake up  
And the sun does not appear  
I...I will be here  
If in the dark we lose sight of love  
Hold my hand and have no fear  
'Cause I...I will be here  
I will be here  
When you feel like bein' quiet  
When you need to speak your mind  
I will listen  
  
And I will be here  
When the laughter turns to cryin'  
Through the winnin' and losin' and tryin'  
We'll be together  
'Cause I will be here  
  
Tomorrow mornin' if you wake up  
And the future is unclear  
I...I'll be here  
Just as sure as seasons are made for change  
Our lifetimes are made for years  
I...I will be here  
  
I will be here  
You can cry on my shoulder  
When the mirror tells us we're older  
I will hold you  
  
And I will be here  
To watch you grow in beauty  
And tell you all the things you are to me  
I will be here  
  
I will be true  
To the promise I have made  
To you and to the  
One who gave you to me  
  
I...I will be here  
And just as sure as seasons are made for change  
Our lifetimes are made for years  
'Cause I...  
I will be here....  
We'll be together, forever  
  
'Cause I will be here  
I will be here
