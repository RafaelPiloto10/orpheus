She comes to me at night when I'm sleeping  
She comes to me when I'm alone  
She comes to me She holds my head when I'm crying  
She comes to me She shuts my eyes  
She brings me home  
  
But I'm not sleeping anymore  
  
She tells me when you look at me She tells me when you're lying  
She tells me when you talk about me She lays me on the floor  
She tells me when you're whispering She lies beside me naked  
She tells me when you laugh at me  
and she locks all the doors  
  
But I'm not sleeping anymore  
  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7a.m.  
All alone again  
But I've been through all this shit before  
Spend my nights in self defense  
Cry about my innocence  
But I ain't all that innocent anymore  
  
I see her on the TV I see her in the movies  
I see her in these animals that dance inside my head  
I'll follow you down baby Down into this valley  
I'll follow you down baby But I won't come up again  
  
But I'm not sleeping anymore
