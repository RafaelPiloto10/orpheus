I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
I said, 'I'm beggin' for mercy, [Incomprehensible] if you please?"  
  
I went down to the crossroads, tried to beg a ride  
Down to the crossroads, tried to beg a ride  
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by  
I wanna take a ride  
  
Going down to Rosedale, take [Incomprehensible] by my side  
Going down to Rosedale, take [Incomprehensible] by my side  
Can still buy a house baby, on the riverside  
One more time  
  
You can run, you can run, tell my friends I'll be by  
You can run, you can run, tell my friends I'll be by  
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down
