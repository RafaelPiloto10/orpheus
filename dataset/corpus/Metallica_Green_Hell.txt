Here in this place lies the key to your death  
Touch it, see it  
Here in this place is the means to your end  
Touch it, feel it  
Green hell  
  
You did your best as someone could  
I bet you never knew you would  
Did you run away from it?  
I bet you thought you were really good  
  
We're gonna burn in hell  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Like every hell but kind of green  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Try let me get back up there  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Feel it burning in your cereal  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Throw our fuckin' friends inside  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Cannot forget about the best  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Hell is reigning in your blood  
Green Hell Green Hell  
Gotta burn it all  
Green hell  
  
You did your best as someone could  
I bet you never knew you would  
And did you run away from me  
I bet you think they were really good  
  
Here in this place lies the key to your death  
Touch it, see it  
Here in this place sister won't let it in  
Touch it, feel it  
Green hell  
  
You did your best as someone could  
I bet you'd never knew you would  
Did you run away from it?  
I bet you thought you were really good  
You've come to this as someone told  
I bet you'd never knew you would  
Gonna bring  
Green hell
