I know it's only natural  
It's just the man that's in me  
That makes me wanna do the things I do  
It's not my fault my soul hungers  
But it makes me stop and wonder  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
Oh I'll take your heart and break it  
And yet somehow you make it  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
I call you a fool, I call you crazy  
That's no way to treat a lady  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
The love it takes to keep me  
It's more than one woman can give me  
Though I know no one can love me more than you  
Surely time will fill my hunger  
And I won't have to wonder  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
Oh I take your heart and break it  
And yet somehow you make it  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
I call you a fool, I call you crazy  
That's no way to treat a lady  
How long will you keep coming back to me  
  
I call you a fool, I call you crazy  
That's no way to treat a lady  
How long will you keep coming back to me
