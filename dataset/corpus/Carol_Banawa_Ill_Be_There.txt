There are times that we are down  
And tired of runnin' off the shore  
There are times that we can't take it at all  
And we let our feelings down  
chorus  
Remember that I am your friend  
Who will always be there for you  
Whenever you're in pain  
Just call out and hear me say  
I'll be there.....  
(I'll be there.. I'll be there..)  
There are times we keep on losin' our way  
And we go astray  
There are times that we can't make it at all  
And we let our feelings down  
(Repeat chorus)
