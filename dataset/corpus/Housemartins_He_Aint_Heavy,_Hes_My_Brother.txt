The road is long  
With many winding turns,  
That leads us to  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But I'm strong  
Strong enough to care  
Ah, He ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
So on we go  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he,  
To where, we'll get there  
But I know  
He will not uncomfort me  
Ah, He ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
The road is long  
With many winding turns  
That leads us to,  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But I'm strong,  
Strong enough to care  
Ah, he ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
When the going gets rough,  
I've got a brother  
When the going gets tough,  
I've got a friend  
Ah, you must call me  
Yeah, yeah  
All you must call me  
He, he's my brother  
He's my brother
