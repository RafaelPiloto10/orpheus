I saw you last night,  
Down at the mere  
I saw your hands were playing gently with her hair  
I see you and I, in my mirror  
I close my eyes and wish that you could be here  
It's my fantasy to have you holding me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
[Chrous]  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(yea, eyeyey)  
  
Get out of my head, get into my heart  
Be for real, are you fictional or real,  
I made up this lie, I made up this life  
When I'm alone it's like you're right here by my side  
It's my fantasy to have you here with me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
If you came I know just what I'd say  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my world turn right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(heye, yeyeyeye)  
  
It's my fantasy to have you all to me, baby  
I'm going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one
