I know I shouldn't bother you cause you asked me not to call  
But tonight I'm not responsible for what I do at all  
You're drivin' me out of my mind is that what you want to do  
Well do me a little favor and drive you out of my mind too  
Drive you out of my mind erase the mem'ries of your touch  
I don't believe I'm askin' for too much  
You're drivin' me out of my mind and you know this is true  
Well do me a little favor and drive you out of my mind too  
Now don't tell me you don't have time cause the problems just can't wait  
If I'll wait until tomorrow it just might be too late  
You're drivin' me out of my mind by lovin' someone new  
So do me a little favor and drive you out of my mind too  
Drive you out of my mind...
