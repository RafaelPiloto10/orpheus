Don't really want to fall out of love,  
And baby I need a lovin' shove,  
To get back in, lord, to get back in.  
To get back in once again, baby.  
  
Oooo, baby when times are good,  
You know they couldn't get no better if they tried to.  
But there's a question standing where I stood,  
You know you act just like the person that's been lied to.  
  
You ain't been treatin' me like you know you should,  
There's been a change in your way.  
Remember what it's like when love is good,  
And remember the chorus 'cause I wrote it for us.  
  
Don't really want to fall out of love,  
And baby I need a lovin' shove,  
To get back in, oh, to get back in.  
To get back in once again.  
  
You know I love that girl with all my heart,  
And, like wine, with age it gets better.  
But I don't like trouble, and when trouble starts,  
It's the times I wish I could forget her.  
  
If you give 'em an inch, boy, then they'll take a mile,  
And gettin' it back's so hard to do.  
They'll take advantage of your gentle style,  
But you've got to forgive them, 'cause you're tryin' to live with them.  
  
Woah ... woah  
Woah, woah ... woah  
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again.  
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again, babe.  
  
To get back in ...
