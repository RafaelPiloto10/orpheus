You're not shy, you get around  
You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground  
You stay up, you won't come down  
You want to live, you want to move to the sound  
Got fire in your veins, burning hot, but you don't feel the pain  
Your desire is insane, you can't stop until you do it again  
  
But sometimes I wonder, as I look in your eyes  
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy  
But I know, yes I know how to treat you right  
That's why you call me in the middle of the night, you say  
  
It's urgent, so urgent, so urgent, just wait and see  
How urgent my love can be, it's urgent  
  
You play tricks on my mind, you're everywhere, but you're so hard to find  
You're not warm, you're sentimental  
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental  
  
But I'm not looking for a love that'll last  
I know what I need and I need it fast  
Yeah there's one thing in common that we both share  
That's our need for each other anytime, anywhere  
  
It gets urgent, so urgent, you know it's urgent  
I want to tell you it's the same for me  
So urgent, just wait and see, how urgent my love can be, it's urgent  
  
You say it's urgent, make it fast, make it urgent  
Do it quick, do it urgent, gotta run, make it urgent  
Wait it quick, want it urgent, urgent, emergency, urgent, urgent, emergency  
Urgent, urgent, emergency, urgent, urgent, emergency  
So urgent, emergency
