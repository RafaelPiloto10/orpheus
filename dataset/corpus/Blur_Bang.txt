Sitting in an S.D.T.  
Waiting for an underground train  
To rumble underneath my feet  
  
Bang goes another day  
Where it went I could not say  
Now I'll have to wait another week  
  
When all is said and all is done  
What was said was never done  
Don't panic, it's not really worth your while  
  
Bang goes another year  
In and out of one ear  
Everybody's doing it, so do it too  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't need anyone  
But a little love would make things better  
But a little love would make things better  
  
Sitting on the early bus  
Passing through the morning rush  
It makes no difference that I'm not with you  
  
Bang goes another year  
In and out of one ear  
Everybody's doing it, so do it too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't need anyone  
But a little love would make things better  
I don't need anyone  
But a little of your love can make things better
