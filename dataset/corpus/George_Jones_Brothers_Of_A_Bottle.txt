Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass  
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.  
  
The happiest moment that I've ever known  
Was the day that she told me she would be my own  
But the bluest moment that ever could be  
When she said she loved someone much better than me.  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass  
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.  
  
Well, I once had a buddy as fine as could be  
We trusted each other completely you see  
Well, then I betrayed him just like any wretch  
No one but a woman could make you do that.  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass  
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.  
  
When God made man I guess this made him sad  
For now they're all good and none are all bad  
Then he made woman to cheat and deceive  
There's been hell ever since the snake tempted Eve.  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass  
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass
