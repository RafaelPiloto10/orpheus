True love is one thing I've been dreaming of  
I give my soul to you and when I do  
You are to me, the very deepest part of me  
In the darkness, is you that always shows the way  
The very air I breathe  
When hope is gone  
You give me all the strength I need to carry on  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
When you hurt me, then I become the night time  
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good  
It shows this heart is not made of wood  
When you stay with me then I can feel the sunlight  
The love light fills my eyes  
And through the tears I feel my fears just melt away  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be
