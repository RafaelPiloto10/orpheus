Waiting till the sun goes down  
Shadows walk in the night  
Living in a fantasy  
In and out of dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own  
  
Every way I turn my eyes  
Shadows pass in the night  
Haunted by reality  
Living out of dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own  
  
I'm waiting till the sun goes down  
Shadows talk in the night  
Living out a fantasy  
Slipping into dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own
