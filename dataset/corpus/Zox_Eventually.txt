The evening smoulders into night  
Turn up the music and I'll drive into the city lights  
The wind is on your face  
I'm blowing kisses down from outer space  
  
Baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
Cause I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
So let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
  
Caress the rhythm with our feet  
We move as one and everyone around can feel the heat  
Let's take a step outside  
Cause me and you got something we should hide  
  
So baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
Cause I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
Let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
  
Uh and it's making me crazy  
To be your friend when you're my fantasy  
Fantasy  
  
The morning's melting into day  
We're nose to nose and I don't think that I could turn away  
The world is in this room  
The world is in this room  
  
Baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
Let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
Make it so you can't say no
