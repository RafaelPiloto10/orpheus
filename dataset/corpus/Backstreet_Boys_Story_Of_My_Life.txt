So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
It's like the world is on your shoulders  
Now nothing's making sense  
You just wanna quit  
You runaway but you just don't know  
How to feel what is real  
You're not alone  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life  
  
Then, sometimes you got to crawl  
Before you start to walk  
I'll be there  
I've had my rainy days  
You try to keep up a smile  
You go the extra mile  
You run the race no matter where your place  
You know which way to go so turn the page  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life  
  
It's hard to be strong  
No right seems wrong  
And nobody hears what you say  
So don't be afraid  
Hold on to your faith  
I swear to you there will be better days  
  
So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
It's like the world is on your shoulders  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
  
Everybody falls (Everybody falls), everybody cries (everybody cries)  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life
