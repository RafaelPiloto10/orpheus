I won't run away no more, I promise  
Even when I get bored, I promise  
Even when you lock me out, I promise  
I say my prayers every night, I promise  
I don't wish that I'm strict, I promise  
The tantrums and the chilling chats, I promise  
Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise  
Tie me to the rotten deck, I promise  
I won't fool around no more, I promise  
Even when I get bored, I promise  
Even when you lock me out, I promise  
I say my prayers every night, I promise  
I won't fool around no more, I promise
