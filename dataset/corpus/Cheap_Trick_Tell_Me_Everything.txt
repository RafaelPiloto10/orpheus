If I could have what I want I'll just want what I've got  
I told myself a million times that's the truth but it's not.  
I could give you some lessons on how to cry all night  
I know the hurting's only started and it might never stop  
  
[Oh Angeline] you want some help from me now  
Now since he left you alone.  
Don't say it ain't so, [you betray people here]  
It's not so long ago that  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I don't know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything.  
  
So pardon me if I don't cry 'cause your love is on the shelf  
After all, you're so good at looking out for yourself  
You might hate me for saying so but that's all right  
You can hate the whole world but it ain't gonna help.  
  
[Oh, Angeline] you're only wasting your time  
Looking for my sympathy  
I hope you're satisfied ' cause I only want to laugh  
When I hear you cry  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
Now he's done it to you  
Like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything  
  
I guess you never thought that you'd be falling in love  
You've lost everything that you're dreaming of  
I can't let you go without letting you know  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I don't know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything  
  
Baby tell me everything (everything to me)  
Baby tell me everything  
Someone did it to you like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything.
