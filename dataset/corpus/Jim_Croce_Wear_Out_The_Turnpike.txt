There's ice and snow on the northern roads  
And the Jersey Pike is closed  
Have to go and do some drivin' tonight  
They say I'd be a fool if I would ride those icy roads  
But a little storm ain't stoppin' me tonight  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
There's a red light turnin' behind me  
There's a trooper on my tail  
I can tell I won't get to New York town on time  
If he decides to pull me over  
And if he get's me on the scale  
I'm gonna have to tell a tale or take a fine  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
With the snow against my windshield  
I will run on through the night  
There's not stoppin' me once I hit the road  
Cause the turnpike's like my second home  
And I know it like my hand  
So diesel sing a song that'll bring me home again  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo
