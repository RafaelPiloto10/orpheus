If you've got a lover, and you've made your mind up  
You don't want my love anymore  
If you're gonna leave and nothing's gonna stop you  
And you're absolutely sure  
I want to try to change your mind or waste your precious time  
Or talk you out of leaving tonight  
Just don't ask me to pretend, that I'll fall in love again  
The minute you walk out that door  
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
I'm gonna miss you, girl when you go  
More than you'll ever know  
I don't know what I will do, don't even have a clue  
Can't think that far ahead right now  
Do the things you want to guilt should never haunt you  
I'll go on without you somehow  
You don't have to call and get 'em, I don't need no friend  
I could never see you that way  
So don't spare me the lie, and I'll promise not to cry  
Baby, when you walk away  
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
I'm gonna miss you, girl when you go  
More than you'll ever know  
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you  
I'm gonna miss you  
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you  
I'm gonna miss you  
I won't try to change your mind, no, waste your precious time  
Or talk you out of leaving tonight  
Just don't ask me to pretend, that I'll fall in love again  
The minute you walk out that door  
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
I'm gonna miss you, girl when you go  
More than you'll ever know
