I'm the desperate  
And you're the savior  
  
There's been something else talkin' in my ear  
Someone save me  
When I speak  
It begins to decay  
I'm not about to bury myself  
Oh, God my hands are shaking again  
Calm down  
Now I can't feel the floor  
And my vision takes it's toll on me  
  
I'm the desperate  
And you're the savior  
  
Oh, God it's racing through my veins  
I'm afraid there must be some kind of mistake  
Oh, I'm in over my head again  
Reach in and grab a hold of me  
I'm so scared that I've started to slip  
They say that I'll never change  
I'll prove 'em wrong  
  
It's over  
  
I hear the calling but it's passing through  
Clean me up show me how to live  
Tear me down  
Let me start again
