[English verse]  
The way you speaak - into my ear  
The way I feel when I know you  
Are near  
Something so good, it must be wrong  
Louise ---be true to me  
  
[French Verse]  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I think about what I've missed  
Without you I'd cease to exist  
If you leave me, Lord I would cry  
Three weeks best, I'd curl up and die  
Be true to me, Te'moi cherie, Louise, Louise  
I - Yi - Yi  
  
Have you seen my baby  
Yes, all the time  
Then you know it's true  
What - I'm in love  
How can you be so sure  
What - tell the truth  
Does it come from your heart  
Yes it does  
Where  
Deep inside  
Where  
From the center  
Good  
Best of luck, and you will need  
Plenty of that
