Too many sad days  
Too many Tuesday mornings  
I thought of you today  
I wished it was yesterday morning  
I thought of you today  
And I dreamt you were dressed in mourning  
But I knew that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning  
I fell through the window  
And I found that I was still breathing  
I thought of tomorrow  
And the fear that you might leave me  
I thought of tomorrow  
And I wished it was Monday evening  
But I knew that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning  
Turn your face from me  
I will cover myself with sorrow  
Bring Hell down upon me  
I will surrender my heart to sorrow  
Bring Hell down upon me  
And I will say goodbye tomorrow  
But I know that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning
