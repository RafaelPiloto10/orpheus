(Rodney Crowell)  
You looked for trouble and you found it son  
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun  
You'd try to run but you don't think you can  
You make one move and you're dead man, friend  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this, can I baby  
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back  
Then he left me freezing on a steel rail track  
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they bay  
I ain't living long like this  
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside drive  
Son of a charhop in some all night dive  
Dad drove a stock car to an early death  
All I remember was a drunk man's death  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this can I baby  
We know the story how the wheel goes round  
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown  
Can't sleep at all in the jailhouse, baby  
I ain't living long like this  
You live for angel, she's a roadhouse queen  
Make Texas ruby look like Sandra Dee  
You want to love her but you don't know how  
You're at the bottom of the jailhouse now  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this, can I baby  
You know the story 'bout the jailhouse rock  
Go on and do it, but just don't get caught  
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they baby  
I ain't living long like this
