[Chorus]  
I like pleasure spiked with pain  
And music is my aeroplane  
It's my aeroplane  
Songbird sweet and sour Jane  
And music is my aeroplane  
It's my aeroplane  
Pleasure spiked with pain  
That mother fucker always spiked with pain  
  
I  
Looking in my own eyes "hello"  
I can't find the love I want  
Someone better slap me  
Before I start to rust  
Before I start to decompose  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
I can make it disappear  
I can make it disappear "have no fear"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sitting in my kitchen "hey girl  
I'm turning into dust again  
My melancholy baby  
The star of mazzy must  
Push her voice inside of me  
I'm overcoming gravity  
I'm overcoming gravity  
It's easy when you're sad to be  
It's easy when you're sad "said 'bout me"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just one note  
Could make me float  
Could make me float away  
One note from  
The song she wrote  
Could fuck me where I lay  
Just one note  
Could make me choke  
One note that's  
Not a lie  
Just one note  
Could cut my throat  
One note could make me die
