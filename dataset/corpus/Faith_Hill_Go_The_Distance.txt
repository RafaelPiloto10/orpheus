You got me headed in a new direction  
Got no reason to turn around  
Ain't got no looking back or second guessing  
It's time to find what love is really all about  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time  
  
The road to love is paved with shiftin' gravel  
We may find ourselves on shaky ground  
And there ain't no place  
That these two hearts can't travel  
Even when we're miles apart  
Together we are bound to  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time  
  
There will be rainy days and bridges left to cross  
But if we lose our way we can't get lost if we  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time
