Ooh!  
Who needs the sky?  
Just watch me fly  
I'm on a natural high  
  
We're on a natural high  
Who needs the sky?  
You can just watch me fly  
On a natural high  
So you won't turn and sigh  
And I feel like I'm 13  
  
Layin' on the sky  
Feel like I'm sailing through a fire  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky  
Who can I tie?  
Ooh  
  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky (caught in the sky)  
Who can I tie? (who can I tie?)
