What she said :  
"How come someone hasn't noticed  
That I'm dead  
And decided to bury me?  
God knows, I'm ready!"  
La-la-la...  
  
What she said was sad  
But then, all the rejection she's had  
To pretend to be happy  
Could only be idiocy  
La-la-la...  
  
What she said was not for the job or  
Lover that she never had  
Oh...  
No no no...  
  
What she read  
All heady books  
She'd sit and prophesise  
(It took a tattooed boy from  
Birkenhead  
To really really open her eyes)

And I need to cling to something!"
