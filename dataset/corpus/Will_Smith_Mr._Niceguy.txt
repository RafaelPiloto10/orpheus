But he classy Big Will just get another 20 mil  
And walk right pass E.

On the radio they be over exaggerating  
So blahzay with they lies  
They be aggravating me, agitating me  
But they waiting and hating me  
They be making me crazy but I be taking it patiently  
People be messing with me testing me F.ing wit me

Before I buy your radio station and send you home  
Yo this is a warning shot over the bawl

You better chill before you climb a tree you can't get down  
  
[B SECTION]  
Ok, people dissing Will sat on a wall  
People dissing Will had a great fall  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
