I've got to find sweet cherry  
She's gone away from home  
I've got to find sweet cherry  
She's left me all alone  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone  
  
My thoughts are always with you  
The emptiness leaves me blue  
If you should ever desert me  
Then life deserts me too  
  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone  
  
When we were together, downtown  
We would do things together, downtown  
The first place I met you, downtown  
There we could always be.  
  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone
