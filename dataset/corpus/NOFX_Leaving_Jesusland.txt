We call the heartland not very smartland, IQ's are very low but threat levels
are high  
They got mandate, they don't want man-dates, they got so many hates and people
to despise  
  
In the dust bowl, cerebral black hole, the average weight is well over 200
pounds  
I hate to generalize, but have you seen the thighs, most haven't seen their
genitalia in a while  
  
Maybe that's why they're so pissed at us  
They're all jealous we're having better sex  
  
Queers, transgends, and lesbians, vegans and vegetarians  
All you brownish red and yellow ones come out and join us on the coast  
  
No longer svelte, they got to punch new holes in the Bible belt  
They've blown out the fire under the melting pot, the red blood of America is
starting to clot  
No compromise, no sight through others' eyes, they're just flies spreading
pieces of shit  
You gotta emigrate, stop living in hate, what makes this country great is
dwelling on either side  
  
They don't want visitors in Jesusland  
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland  
  
We want people with college degrees, drug use experience and STD's  
People with open-minded philosophies, come hug California trees  
Cultural revolution now, neo-conservatives run outta town  
We're gonna burn Orange County down,  
And then we're off to Riverside, Bakersfield and Fresno too, then we're comin'
after you  
  
The fear stricken, born again Christian, they got a vision a homogenized state  
Texas textbooks, Bibles, and prayer books,  
They want them memorized, but don't want you to think  
  
They don't want visitors in Jesusland  
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland  
  
Punk Rockers and emo kids, people doin' things the church forbids  
Buddhists, agnostics, and atheists we're moving out of jesusland  
Art students and thespians, (excluding country) all the musicians  
We want all hookers and comedians, nihilists are welcome too  
  
No longer svelte, they gotta punch holes in the Bible belt
