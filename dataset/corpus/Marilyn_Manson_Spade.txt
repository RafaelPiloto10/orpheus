The beauty spot was borrowed and  
Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow.  
I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard.  
Burn your empty rain down on me  
Whisper your death beat so softly  
We bend our knees  
At the altar of my ego  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
All my lilies' mouths are open  
Like they're begging for dope  
And hoping  
Their bitter petal chant,  
"We can kick , you won't be back."  
I'm a diamond that is tired  
Of all the faces I've acquired  
We must secure the shadow  
Ere the substance fades  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
And we said 'til we die  
And we said 'til we die
