You hear his voice above the roaring of the crowd  
Dance while he goes through his charade  
You see him standing there so tall and proud  
And you know damn well the man has got it made  
  
[Chorus]  
Applause, applause for your favorite entertainer  
Write a love letter to your favorite entertainer  
Applause, applause, because he's up there singing just for you  
Singing just for you  
  
His every movement draws you closer to the stage  
Helplessly carried on the tide  
Giddy and feeling almost half your age  
It's magic he's got going on inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'd love to touch him, but you know you wouldn't dare  
To kiss the lips that sing the song  
You wave and scream to let him know you're there  
With luck he'll sign the book you've brought along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Singing just for you
