You chose to take  
From the past  
You want a game  
That's built to last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You chose to take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend  
  
You wanna lay  
In the past  
You'll do anything  
To make your pain last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You just take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend  
  
Run away, go away [Repeat: x30]  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything with you my friend  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
Is this the end?
