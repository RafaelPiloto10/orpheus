Out of morning and into midnight,  
Through the sunrise and under moonlight.  
Isobella, oh!  
Isobella, dream of me.  
Everything that comes from day  
Comes into the heart to stay.  
Love is in your name each day.  
In the moment you come before me,  
In that moment I see you only  
Isobella, oh!  
Isobella, dream of me.  
  
Everything that comes from night  
Comes within your shining light.  
Love is in your name each night.
