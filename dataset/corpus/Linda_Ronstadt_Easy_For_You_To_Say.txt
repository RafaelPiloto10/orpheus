I heard some talk around this town  
Talk about you and me  
How a fool fell out of love with you  
Wanted to be free  
  
Well that's easy for you to say  
That I don't know what I'm doing  
That I've thrown our love away  
And left my life in ruin  
That's easy for you to say  
  
I read your letter again  
I'm sure you know the one  
"Goodbye," you said like a coward  
"It'll be better in the long run"  
  
Well that's easy for you to say  
That I don't know what I'm doing  
That I've thrown our love away  
Left my life in ruin  
That's easy for you to say  
  
Go back to her again  
Back to the way you were  
She's a damn sight better for you  
You're a damn sight better for her  
  
Well that's easy for you to say  
That I don't know what I'm doing  
When you've thrown our love away  
Left my life in ruin  
That's easy for you to say
