Apple fall out of the tree and hit the ground  
Pretty soom we realize we're earthly bound  
Babies fall and babies cry in early years  
Mamas dust them off and wipe away the tears  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ohhhhhhhh watch out for that gravity storm  
It don't give no warning signs  
Ohhhhhhhh watch out for that gravity storm  
Ohhoo  
  
All your life you have to deal with ups and downs  
So listen to your heartstrings as you move around  
Don't forget to listen to the steady beat  
Don't forget to balance on your ready feet  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter in the storm  
All your life  
I well keep you warm  
Shelter from the storm  
All your life  
  
Apple fall out of the tree and hit the ground  
Pretty soon we realize we're earthly bound  
Babies fall and babies cry in early years  
Mamas dust them off and wipe away the tears  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter in the storm  
All your life  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter from the storm  
All your life
