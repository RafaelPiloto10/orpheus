Exit 8  
Small cafe  
Georgia moonlight  
It's three A. M.  
I've been driving all night  
Got a funny air  
Red-brown hair  
In the porch light  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'  
She said tired  
I said I'm a little bit unstable  
She said 'Honey, I will help you if I'm able  
There's a bottle of relief upon the table  
And we're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'  
She said 'i was born the year the rockets landed  
Circa 1969 and I got stranded  
Yeah, but the comet's getting close  
And I can't stand it. '  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
Exit A  
Small cafe  
Smoke at three  
Georgia moonlight  
It's eight A. M.  
I've been drinking all night  
And there is nothing I will not do to make it all right  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'
