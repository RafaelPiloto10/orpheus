[Puff Intro]  
Yeah  
The old school  
To the new school  
Bad Boy, remix, let's go  
  
[Black Rob]  
Like that  
Black gon' slide with Mike Jack  
Puff done remixed one hell of a track  
Put me on it  
I wanna know  
How many want it?  
Damn, it feels good to see people love on it  
For those who love slow down  
'Member Motown had a brotha' happy as shit  
I mean the whole sound  
Bangin' and catch six-four since we was shorties  
Fee owes now rebooked from California  
  
Carry 40's but I 'member them times in '79  
When I first started to rhyme  
Sometimes I gots to look back at what it was  
The good old days  
The triple o'shays when there was love  
  
I want you back  
But I can't grab that far  
It's how it is  
When you're living like a star, bad boy  
Come on, let's go  
  
[Mj]  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces  
Always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
When love was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me  
(Back in your heart)  
Oh, darlin' I was blind to let you go  
(Let you go baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
(I want you back)  
Oh, I do now  
(I want you back)  
Oh, oh, baby  
(I want you back)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(I want you back)  
Nah, nah, nah, nah  
  
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want you around  
  
Let me tell ya now  
Oh baby all I need is one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me  
(Back in your heart)  
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go  
(Let you go baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
(I want you back)  
  
[Black Rob]  
It's just like Jermain Jackson  
Tito, Mike and Marlon  
Only think on my mind now is stardom  
Blowin' the F-up  
My game's stepped up  
'Member when Mike and them  
First came to record  
Singin' hits like Skywriter  
My Girl, People Make The World Go 'Round  
Mama's Pearl, Can't Loose it  
Joyful jukebox music  
Never Can Say Goodbye  
That's why we use it  
  
It's money honey  
So I gots to be there  
And I'm be yo Sugar Daddy  
Say it's real  
Versachi chair, pd, life of the party  
Bad Boy, make joys for everbody  
  
Jackson 5 Chorus in background while:  
  
[Puff Daddy]  
Motown  
Berry Gordy  
History  
Let's go, come on  
Yeah  
Come on  
Yeah  
  
This is the remix, come on  
From the old to the new  
Come on  
Motown  
Rock on  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
[Jackson 5 Chorus until fade]
