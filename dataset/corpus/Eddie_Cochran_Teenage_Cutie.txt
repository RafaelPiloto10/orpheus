Teenage cutie, don't say maybe, you just gotta kiss me tonight  
Teenage baby, don't refuse me, you just gotta hug me tonight  
You gotta tickle my chin, run your fingers through my hair  
You gotta sit real close, whisper in my ear  
You gotta say you care, you be my gal  
Baby, I wanna be more than a pal  
So teenage cutie, say you love me, please don't tease me  
And we'll rock and roll the rest of the night  
  
You gotta cuttle uo and hold me tight  
You gotta kiss me honey and a-kiss me right  
You gotta say you care, you be my gal  
Baby, I wanna be more than a pal  
So teenage cutie, say you love me, please don't tease me  
And we'll rock and roll the rest of the night  
Well teenage cutie, teenage cutie, teenage cutie
