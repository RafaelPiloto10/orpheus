We flew into town on Sunday, had to find a place by Monday  
Tried Bridgeport and Westport, 'til we found a place that we thought would do  
157 Riverside Avenue.  
  
Saugatuck River's flowin', Mother nature's colors were showin'  
So cold, so rainy, we couldn't help feelin' blue  
Not enough time, too many things to do.  
  
We met a young girl on Main street, wanted to just pass her by  
She was homely, so lonely, She said, "Can I make love to you."  
We shouted 157 Riverside Avenue.  
  
It's over, Miss Lena, we're leaving. Such a pleasant stay, I must say.  
So nice, so easy, we hate to say goodbye to you  
At 157 Riverside Avenue.
