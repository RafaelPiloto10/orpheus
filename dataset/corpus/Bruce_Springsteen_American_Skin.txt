You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule  
Praying for his life  
  
Is it a gun?  
Is it a knife?  
Is it a wallet?

It ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)  
It ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)  
Ain't no secret my friend  
You can get killed just for living in your american skin
