[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Stained coffee cup  
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
Sweet, where you lay  
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
Taste, on my tongue  
I don't want to wash away the night before  
  
[Verse 4: Harry Styles]  
In the heat, where you lay  
I could stay right here and burn in it all day  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless  
Her perfume's holding me ransom  
Sweet and sour, heart devoured  
Lying here I count the hours  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control
