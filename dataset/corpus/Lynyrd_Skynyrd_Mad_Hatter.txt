We just landed  
We just touched down  
It just hit home yeah that a good man's gone  
Hey cat in the hat  
We're all gonna miss you  
And all of your practical jokes yeah  
And taking three steps with you  
  
[Chorus]  
We never say goodbye we always say so long  
You had nine lives I can't believe their all gone  
Mad hatters movin' on yeah he's moving on  
  
Well I will see you again one way or another  
And now that your there yeah say "Hello" to our brothers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The cat in the hat is gone  
  
Travelin' man the spirits never gone  
It lives on and on and on and on  
  
Mad hatter  
  
So how 'bout our tribute  
And light up a match  
And tell all your brothers and sisters about the cat in the hat  
He had nine lives I can't believe there all gone  
I know the mad hatter he's moving on  
Mad hatters moving on  
Oh he's gone  
Travelin' on travel on  
Mad haters moving on see ya later
