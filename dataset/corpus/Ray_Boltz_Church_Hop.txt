Church Hop  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and John Higgins  
Once there was a shepherd  
I've been told  
Had some sheep  
Who wouldn't stay in the fold  
Sunday morning, Wednesday night  
Checking out every church in sight  
Shepherd said,  
Kids we gotta have a talk  
The wolves are gonna get you  
If you're not in a flock  
chorus:  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Once you get started  
You just can't stop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Some folks go where they get fed  
They do  
Some folks go where they feel led  
Do you?  
Some folks just can't  
Make up their mind  
Changing churches all the time  
They want something hot  
They want something new  
They just can't find that perfect pew  
chorus  
Some for the money  
Some for the show  
Preach about commitment  
And they go, go, go  
Doing that church hop  
Doing that church hop  
Once you get started  
You just can't stop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
chorus
