I see from look in your eyes, there's  
Something I could never deny  
For the first the first  
After all this time  
I found true love  
  
I have never been so happy in my life  
Till you finally showed me for the first time  
I know this time I found true love  
  
CHROUS  
And I believe from the moment we met  
Your love is truly as good as it is  
That, once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
And I believe for the very first time  
Your love is truly  
Meant to be mine  
And my heart knows once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
You gave me the reason to live, now  
All I ever want is to give you all of me  
Cause I believe you gave me true love  
  
REPEAT CHORUS
