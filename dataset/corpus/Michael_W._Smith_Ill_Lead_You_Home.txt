Wandering the road of desperate life  
Aimlessly beneath a barren sky  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
So afraid that you will not be found  
It won't be long before your sun goes down  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
A troubled mind and a doubter's heart  
You wonder how you ever got this far  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left  
You got no way to retrace your steps  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
You're lost and alone  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
So let it go and turn it over to  
The one who chose to give his life for you  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
You're lost and alone  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home
