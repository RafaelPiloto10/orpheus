Take the jib sail down boys take the jib sail down  
Turn this ship around boys before we run aground  
The fish aren't bitin' today boys fish aren't bitin' today  
I'm gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a sunk cause the fish aren't bitin'
today  
  
There's six foot waves and my stomach craves some good old Antiguan Rum  
I took some away for a rainy day and the rain she is startin' to come now  
Take the jib sail down boys...  
  
There's a northern wind and the lights are dim like a good fresh Cuban cigar  
I got me a hunch where there might be a bunch in the Captain's pickle jar  
So take the jib sail down boys...

The fish aren't bitin' today boys...
