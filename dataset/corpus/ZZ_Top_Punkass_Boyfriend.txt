So you stayed in my house for about a year  
Ate my food and you drank my beer  
You took my money, kept asking for more  
When you disappeared, didn't close the door, baby  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
Then you came around and I bought you a brand new car  
I said, I loved you, didn't get me very far  
Then another round of give me that and give me this  
Then boom, you were gone, I got the total dis'  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
So wrong  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
So wrong  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
One, two  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
Clouding up the issue  
Punk ass boyfriend  
I just want to kiss you  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
Clouding up the issue  
It's that punk boyfriend  
I just want to kiss you  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
It's your punk ass boyfriend
