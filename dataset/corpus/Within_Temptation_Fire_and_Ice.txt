Every word you're saying is a lie  
Run away my dear  
But every sign will say your heart is dead  
  
Bury all the memories  
Cover them with dirt  
Where's the love we once had  
Our destiny's unsure  
  
Why can't you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Where's the love we once had  
Is it all a lie?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Closer to insanity  
Buries me alive  
  
Where's the life we once had  
It cannot be denied  
  
Why can't you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Where's the love we once had  
Is it all a lie?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
You run away  
You hide away  
To the other side of the universe  
where you're safe from all that hunts you down  
But the world has gone  
Where you belong  
And it feels too late so you're moving on  
Can you find your way back home?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Every word you're saying is a lie.
