Someday I won't come running when you call  
The way you hurt me it's a wonder I'm still here at all  
Someday you'll wake up and you'll find yourself alone  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
  
I can't go on the way you make me live  
Make me cry and every time expect me to forgive  
Someday you'll wake up to a cold and lifted dawn  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
  
Someday I'll wake up find me strength and move along  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone
