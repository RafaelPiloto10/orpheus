Got a flat in Timbuktu  
Waiting for AAA  
And I saw that single headlight through the rain  
Flagged the geezer in the car down,  
He was going the wrong way  
We sped away and left rubber on all four lanes  
He pulled a quick you-turn,  
And hit a pickup from Montana  
While plowin' down a fire hydrant too  
Windshield wipers slappin' time  
As he committed several traffic crimes  
This man's like a one man wreckin' crew  
Speedin's just a little bit of what he put me through  
He went off the road and hit a tree  
Yeah drivin' can't be easy when you're 4 foot 2.  
Drivin's not that difficult to do,  
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo  
When we drove right through a coal mine  
And hit a school bus filled with nuns  
We dragged along a string of traffic poles  
Through all kinds of weather  
Through eighteen hit and runs  
I still love that baby  
Kept us on the run  
One day he lost his specs  
Oh lord! He let 'em slip away  
Still lookin' for them glasses  
I hope he finds them.  
Well I'd trade all of my tomorrows for some Dramamine today  
I just hope they know which body bag is mine.  
Speedin's just a little bit of what he put me through  
His drivin', you know it scared the pee right out of me, yeah  
He' s swervin' and he's weaving', and he doesn't have a clue  
You know divan's not that difficult to do  
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo  
Oh, lucky for us I know a little used shortcut  
Oh look out, oh look out,  
Oh look out, oh look out,  
Oh look out, watch out now  
Mr. Magoo.
