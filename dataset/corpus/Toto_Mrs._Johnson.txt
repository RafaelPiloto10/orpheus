Know these words are wrong to say  
Need you more and more each day  
(Chorus:)  
Hey Mrs. Johnson  
Give me your answer as fast as you can  
Hey Mrs. Johnson  
Don't you know I really love you  
Here's my life, it's yours today  
Help me chase the blues away  
(Repeat chorus)  
(Instrumental break)  
Know these words are wrong to say  
Need you more and more each day  
(Repeat chorus two times)
