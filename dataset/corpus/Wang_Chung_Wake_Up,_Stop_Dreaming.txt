Wake up, stop dreaming  
The sun is in the sky again  
There's a hole in the ocean  
And water's pouring through  
Oh, wake up, stop dreaming  
And wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Are you frightened of heights?  
Are you falling?  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
I'm talkin' 'bout dream and reality  
I'm talkin' 'bout love and brutality  
And I'm saying wake up, wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
Before the shutters start to groan  
Well it's something you said in the noon day sun  
But I don't recall, I don't recall  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
Stop this seeming half reality  
Don't turn your face away  
Look at me  
As you lie sleeping  
Someone's keeping everything I knew  
Don't try to run away  
It's all new  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
I'm talkin' 'bout dream and reality  
I'm talkin' 'bout love and brutality  
And I'm saying wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up
