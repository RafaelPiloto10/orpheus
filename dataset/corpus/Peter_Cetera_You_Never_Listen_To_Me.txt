You say not now, it's too late  
Now's not the time, it can wait  
You never listen to me  
Some things are hard to forget  
It's time to do something you might regret  
You never listen to me  
  
I think that you must be blind  
Havn't you noticed that I'm not around  
Waisting your precious time  
  
All that I want  
Is knowing that someone will notice me  
I can't go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me  
  
Losing the will to survive  
You never act like you know I'm alive  
You never listen to me  
  
All that I need  
Is knowing that someone remembers me  
I can't go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me
