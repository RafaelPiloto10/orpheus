Don't expect me to treat you like a lady  
I may not always show respect  
It's too soon, yet I hardly even know you  
That's just my way, don't get upset, [Incomprehensible]  
Uptill now I've been living like a loner  
Gettin' by, ooh, just gettin' by  
And this heart of mine has only had one owner  
But you could change that if you tried, baby  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in, let me right into your heart, oh yeah  
I intend to treat you like a woman  
'Cause I can see you're not a child  
'Cause you've got that look, that certain way of knowin'  
It's got my senses runnin' wild, oh yeah  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in  
The moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line, the moment of truth this time  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in  
The moment of truth, oh  
It's the moment of truth and the time is come  
Moment of truth, moment of truth  
Moment of truth, it's time  
Moment of truth, oh, we gotta draw the line  
Moment of truth, open your heart to me, baby, let me in  
Moment of truth, open your heart, let me in  
Moment of truth
