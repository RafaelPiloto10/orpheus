Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two  
One of these days I'll be back with you  
Counting the ways that I love you  
Through and through  
  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Tentatively you put up the signs  
Letting me know you are mine  
  
And I'm counting on you  
To be here through it all  
I'm counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do, remember  
I'm always counting on you  
  
Flight six, eight, one, gate forty-two  
At seven fifteen I'll feel ten feet tall  
Knowing you care after all  
  
And I'm counting on you  
To be here through it all  
I'm counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do, remember  
I'm always counting on you  
  
Counting on you  
To be here through it all  
Counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Remember I'm always  
Counting on you
