So here we stand in our secret place,  
The sound of the crowd is so far away,  
You take my hand, and it fees like home,  
We both understand, it where we belong  
So do I say, do I say goodbye,  
We both have our dreams we both want to fly,  
So lets take tonight, to carry us through the lonely times  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll always look back as I walk away  
Memories will last for eternity  
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain  
As I found my way back to your arms again  
But until that day, you know you are  
The Queen of my heart  
  
So lets take tonight, and never let go  
While we dance we kiss, like there's no tomorrow,  
As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring,  
I'll treasure this moment, till we meet again  
  
But no matter how far, away you may be ,  
I'll just close my eyes, and your in my dreams,  
And there you will be, until we will meet.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
