Lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay while the night,  
The night is still here  
  
Whatever colors you have in your mind  
I'll show them to you  
And you can see them shine  
  
Lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay with your man  
Just a little while  
  
His clothes are dirty  
But his hands are clean  
And you're the best thing  
He's ever seen  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay with you man  
Just a little while  
Til the break of day  
  
Come on, let me see you  
Make him smile  
Why wait any longer  
For the world to begin  
You can have your cake  
And eat it too  
Why wait any longer  
For the one that you love  
Why he's standing right in front of you  
  
Come lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay while the night is still ahead....
