Console me in my darkest hour  
Could this be that the truth is always gray  
Caress me in your velvet chair  
Conceal me from the ghost you cast away  
  
I'm in no hurry, you go run  
And tell your friends I'm losing touch  
Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom  
It must be true  
  
Console me in my darkest hour  
And tell me that you'll always hear my cries  
I wonder what you got conspired  
I'm sure it was the consolation prize  
  
I'm in no hurry, you go run  
And tell your friends I'm losing touch  
Fill the night with stories, the legend grows  
Of how you got lost  
  
But you made your way back home  
You sold your soul, like a Roman vagabond yeah  
  
I heard you found a wishing well  
In the city  
Console me in my darkest hour (in my darkest hour)  
And you throw me down  
  
I'm in no hurry, you go run  
And tell your friends I'm losing touch  
Fill your crown with rumors  
Impending doom, it must be true  
  
But you made your way back home  
You sold your soul, like a Roman vagabond  
  
And all that now you got lost, but you made your way back home  
You went and sold your soul, an allegiance dead and gone  
I'm losing touch
