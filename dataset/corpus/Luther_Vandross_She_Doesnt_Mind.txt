For love you pay the price  
You give it up, you sacrifice  
And if necessary you comprimise  
Sometimes it's bitter sweet  
You've got to try eight days a week  
To create a good enough love to keep  
You see hearts belong to fire  
So does her love  
She burns me up with desire  
  
My girl's love is right on time  
"Sweet" and "sweet and ever kind"  
She's so fine  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We don't fuss, we never fight  
'Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
It was out of my hands  
I did my best, please understand  
I was late for one of our evening plans  
Champagne, dinner for two  
With candlelight, she set the mood  
But there wasn't anything I could do  
  
But, she is so forgiving  
The one thing I know is  
It's off her love I'm living  
  
That girl's love is right on time  
"Sweeter than sweet" and "ever kind"  
She's so fine  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We don't fuss, we never fight  
'Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
When I go out to play  
She doesn't mind if I'm a little bit late  
She knows I think about her face  
Till I get home  
Till I get back home  
What we gonna do tonight?  
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside  
So let's just love until we get things right  
And waste a whole lotta time  
I don't mind  
  
I tell her things she can't repeat  
Makes her little heart just skip a beat  
She blush a little bit  
And then I find  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
Even though our love is "C'est Si Bon"  
Sometimes I like to be alone  
Ring the girl on her private line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
Go to work early, come back late  
Outta my head, can't concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
She's better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
When I call her in the middle of the day  
She's busy at work, but it's okay  
But not too busy to give me time  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind
