A soldier of fortune came home from war  
And wondered what he was fighting for  
This sad-eyed soldier, he broke down and cried  
Oh oh, he was so broke up inside  
  
When will it end  
When will it end  
The bell tolls  
For those about to die  
  
The battle's over the war is won  
But this soldier of fortune he will carry on  
He will carry on when all hope is gone  
He will carry on  
  
He's trained to kill and kill he will  
As we march along  
Singing just another soldier song  
Just another soldier song  
  
I am a soldier of fortune  
Destined to keep on marching  
I can hear the pipers calling
