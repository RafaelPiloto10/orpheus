I got Elvis on my elbow.  
When I flex, Elvis talks.  
I got hula girls on the back of my leg.  
And she hulas when I walk.  
  
Screaching cherry red  
Screamin' electric green  
Purple mountain's majesty  
Really talk to me. Talk to me, babe.

Mousewife to momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo.  
Tattoo, tattoo  
  
(Tattoo, tattoo) Show me your dragon magic.  
(Tattoo, tattoo) So autobiographic.  
  
Best believe that needle won't hurt you.  
Best to see these true colors, than to follow one of your false virtues.  
  
Here's a secret to make you think:  
Why is the crazy stuff we never say, poetry in ink?  
Speaking dayglow red,  
Explode-o pink, purple mountain's majesty  
Show me you, I'll show you me.

Uncle Danny, had a coal tattoo  
He fought for the unions  
Some of us still do.  
On my shoulder is the number  
Of the chapter he was in.  
That number is forever  
Like the struggle here to win.
