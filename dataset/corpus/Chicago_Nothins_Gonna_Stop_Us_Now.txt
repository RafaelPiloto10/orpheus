He was lost, uncertain.  
Only she could see  
He was waiting for the night to end.  
And with just one kiss  
Brought him back into the light again.  
He said nothin's gonna stop us now.  
He said baby, nothing's gonna stop us now.  
  
But tonight, she's waiting  
For a stranger's touch at the dark end of a street  
And the whispered words from the sidewalk  
They sound so sweet  
He says nothin's gonna stop us now.  
She said baby, nothin's gonna stop us now.  
  
Look out now, 'cause she'll break your heart again  
No one sees what the years have failed to mend, yeh.  
Standin' there beneath the street lights.  
Telling secrets in the darkest night.  
Heaven's just a stolen kiss away.  
  
And her look, it lingers  
On a restless night when you're back on the street again.  
With his empty dreams, there's another broken heart to mend.  
He says nothing's gonna stop us now.  
They said baby, nothing's gonna stop us now.  
I'm telling you baby, nothin's gonna stop us now.  
They said baby, nothin' gonna stop us now.  
  
And tonight, she's waiting  
On
