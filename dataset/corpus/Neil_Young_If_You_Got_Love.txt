When you walk in a room  
You hold your head up high  
You talk to people eye to eye  
There's nothing to hide  
You're feeling  
So complete inside  
Your heart feels  
So complete inside  
'Cause you got love.  
  
If you got love  
You know you got it  
If you got love  
Can't live without it  
If you got love  
The world you're walking in  
Is at your command  
  
You're staring  
In the face of scorn  
You know your spirit  
Can't be torn  
You're living like a satellite  
Maintain your distance  
Through the night  
You know that  
Something isn't right  
Your heart tells you  
It's just not right  
'Cause you got love.  
  
If you got love  
You know you got it  
If you got love  
Can't live without it  
If you got love  
The world you're walking in  
Is at your command.  
  
If you got love  
The world you're walking in  
Is at your command  
If you got love  
To share  
If you got love  
To share.
