Wehell I see them every night in tight blue jeans  
In the pages of a Blue Boy magazine  
Hey I've been thinking of a new sensation  
I'm picking up good vibration  
Ooh she bop, she bop  
  
Do I want to go out with a lion's roar  
Huh, yea, I want to go south and get me some more  
Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine  
They say I better stop or I'll go blind  
Ooh she bop, she bop  
  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu bop  
I hope he will understand  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu she bop  
Ohh ohh she do she bop  
  
Hey, hey they say I better get a chaperon  
Because I can't stop messin' with the danger zone  
Hey, I won't worry, and I won't fret  
Ain't no law against it yet, oh she bop, she bop  
  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu bop  
I hope he will understand  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu she bop  
Ohh ohh she do she bop  
  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu bop  
I hope he will understand  
She bop he bop and we bop  
I bop you bop and they bop  
Be bop be bop a lu she bop  
Ohh ohh she did it she bop  
Ohh ohh she dif it she bop
