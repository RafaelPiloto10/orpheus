[Chorus]  
Lord I gotta keep on moving.  
Lord I gotta get on down.  
Lord I gotta keep on moving.  
Where I can't be found  
Law is coming after me.  
  
I've been accused of a killing  
Lord knows I didn't do  
For hanging me they are willing yeah  
That's why I gotta get on through.  
Law is coming after me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got two boys and a woman  
They're just gonna suffer now.  
Lord forgive me for not going back  
But I'll be there anyhow,  
I'll be there anyhow.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now maybe someday I'll find a piece of land  
Somewhere not by or near anyone.  
Then I'll send for my love, love, love sweet woman.  
And my two grown up son's,  
My two grown up sons.  
  
[Chorus]
