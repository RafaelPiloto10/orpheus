Oooooh---oooooohoooooh---ooooooh  
Night trainnight train  
Taking us down  
To the heat  
To the beat  
In the deep of the night  
  
Night train  
Running right on time  
Going down, down, down  
In the deep of the night  
  
Oooooooooh--oooooooh  
Dancing on the night-wire  
Dancing on the night-wirerepeat  
  
People meet  
Get wild in the street  
In the heat  
To the beat  
In the deep of the night  
  
And that's the way  
We communicate  
Going down, down, down  
In the deep of the night

Going round and around  
In the deep of the night

Oooooooh--oooooooh  
Moving on the night-wire
