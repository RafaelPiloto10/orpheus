She's a sensation  
She's a sensation  
She looks so sweet  
  
She's a sensation  
She's a sensation  
Good enough to eat  
  
She's a sensation  
Oh-oh-oh  
She looks a so fine  
She's a sensation  
She's a sensation  
I'm gonna make her mine  
  
No matter what you do  
I give my heart to you  
And oh-oh-baby  
I will give it to you  
No matter what they say  
Yeah, we can find a way  
And oh-oh baby  
We can find a way  
  
I didn't find a way  
Till I walked you home  
That, I feel the way I do  
And I don't care  
What the neighbors say  
I always will be true  
I always will love you  
Love you  
A wo wo wo wo
