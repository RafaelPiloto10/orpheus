Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off.  
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes.  
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time,  
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right.  
...And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue  
Hey my baby don't you know our love is true.  
  
Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies.  
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright,  
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly.  
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand.  
...And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you.  
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true.  
  
I've been so far from here,  
Far from your warm arms.  
It's good to feel you again,  
It's been a long long time. Hasn't it?
