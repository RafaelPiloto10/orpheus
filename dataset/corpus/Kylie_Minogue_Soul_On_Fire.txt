Ooh yeah, there you were  
Standin' outside the door  
Years since I told you I  
Couldn't go on this way no more  
  
Had no explanation  
F-are-you-s-tration  
Thought I was so very sure  
Oh, oh  
  
So you went on your way  
Hittin' up at the party scene  
Actin' as if you were  
Entirely over me  
  
Dancin' with all the ladies  
Just so the news would make it  
Directly to the hot hot line  
Now you're settin' my soul on fire  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Didn't know how good it was 'til you were gone  
Oh  
Woah  
  
Now you're playin' with my head  
And you only forget  
All the things I put you through  
But I never stopped lovin' you  
  
Forget all that I said  
Can't we go back to bed  
Let bygones go on by  
Cause now you're settin' by soul on fire  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Didn't know how good it was 'til you were gone  
Woah  
Woah  
Now I only want you back so come on home  
Woah  
Woah  
Didn't know how much I'd miss you on my own  
Oh  
Baby come on home  
  
So find it in your heart  
Hear my apology  
We've taken it this far  
Don't you want the rest  
The best of me  
  
Oh  
Woah  
Woah  
Didn't know how good it was 'til you were gone  
Woah  
Woah  
Now I only want you back so come on home  
Woah  
Woah  
Didn't know how much I'd miss you on my own  
Oh  
Baby come on home  
  
Mm, mm, mm
