See old Mabel walk on down the house (??)  
Pickin flowers for someone else  
See old Mabel walk down the house  
Said son, better go on back inside  
Storm brewing from the northwest side  
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin  
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive  
  
See old Mabel walk on down the store  
Buying groceries to eat  
Walkin on down the street  
  
Said son, you better go on back inside  
Storm brewing from the northwest side  
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin  
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive  
  
See old Mabel walk on down the house  
Pickin flowers for someone else  
Old Mabel (?????)  
Family bible on the coffee table  
In old mabel's house
