So the chemistry set,  
And I'm not the saddest cheerleader  
To forget the American word.  
For the gang in the head  
That dwindles 'til no members won.  
The mysteries met,  
The sky looks threatened  
Heading home in the dust,  
Singing "Life is Forgetting",  
Good enough for the frivolous  
  
There's one thing I remember is  
This tear on your bare shoulder,  
This little silver boulder,  
This slowly falling star.  
We're rolling, so what?  
Never getting older where the moonshocked curtains part.  
The start of enough  
A teardrop, then a Vaccination scar.  
  
I'll tell ya if I'm involved, that is,  
I'll tell ya like it is.  
Random like a bad cartoon, like  
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge,  
Like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  
  
Swimming on a bit,  
'Stop, you're treading water' as the sun assimilated the words.  
For lighthouse fire  
Burning down to embers end.  
The mysteries met  
Sky just reddened  
Headin' home under dusk.  
Is life just forgettin' another word for frivolous?  
Little silver boulder, silence from Mars.  
For the heart of enough  
Or a teardrop, then a Vaccination Scar.  
  
Wherever you are,  
Scar
