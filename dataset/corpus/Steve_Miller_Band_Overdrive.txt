Well, the room is a cyclone  
And you are in the eye  
There ain't no movement  
Things that could die  
But the reelin' and the spinnin'  
Of the rock and roll sides  
Will all be gone before midnight  
And die before sunrise  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
If you know what it is  
And you wanna stay alive  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
Yes, the corner's full of monkeys  
And your ear drum's full of lies  
Time is out the window  
And there's echoes in your sides  
They've been burnin' down your walls  
Ever since the peep of dawn  
And now the dealer's in the fireplace  
Tryin' to turn it on  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
If you know that it's time  
And you oughtta take a dive  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
You know what it is  
And you wanna stay alive  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
Now the light road's gettin' restless  
Cause he knows your overdue  
But it's just another train ride  
Bein' all the same to you  
And the last shot's at your finger tips  
Like that flicker in the grass  
And the last cord hits the ashes  
And you know you gotta pass  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive  
If you know that it's time  
And you oughtta take a dive  
You better go to overdrive  
Go to overdrive
