As for this song  
I'll set the mood  
There's nothing wrong  
Prefer solitude  
Alone to think  
Of what I don't know  
The deeper I sink  
The further I'll go  
  
Nothing to fear  
No need to hide  
I'm already there  
Came in from outside  
Safe in my nest  
Home sweet home  
No invited guests  
I want to be alone  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
I wish you would  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
I just want to be alone  
  
It's better this way  
No one will get hurt  
If you stay away  
I won't lose my shirt  
If I have become  
Too defensive  
I'm not the one  
You have to live with  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be, I want to be  
I want to be, alone  
  
Don't feel sorry  
It's not your concern  
Only the lonely  
Are the ones who get burned  
Safe in my nest  
Home sweet home  
No invited guests  
I want to be alone
