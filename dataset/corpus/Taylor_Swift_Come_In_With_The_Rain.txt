I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't wanna go there anymore  
And I know all the steps up to your door  
But I don't wanna go there anymore  
  
Talk to the wind  
Talk to the sky  
Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up and sing you a song  
But I don't wanna have to go that far  
And I, I've got you down  
I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start  
  
Talk to yourself  
Talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
And don't wait for the sky to clear  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I've watched you so long  
Screamed your name  
I don't know what else I can say  
  
But I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
For all these games  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't wanna go there anymore
