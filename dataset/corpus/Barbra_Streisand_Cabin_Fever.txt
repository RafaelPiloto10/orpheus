Church bells were ringing and I heard angels singing  
On the day that I said "I do"  
He gave me a kiss and I thought wedded bliss  
Was a mother-to be's dream come true  
The he carried me across the threshold and I heard the front door slam  
Cabin fever had just began  
Pack his lunch at six-thirty but do not disturb him  
Cause he wants to sleep in till eight  
If I don't remind him it's time to get up  
He tells me it's my fault he's late  
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime  
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three  
Cabin fever is killing me  
  
At seven he calls up and says "don't cook supper"  
When he knows that it's already done  
My kids climb the curtains and I climb the walls  
He's with the boys having fun  
Let me try to get a breath of fresh air  
And all I ever get's the third degree, I got to leave here  
Cabin fever's killing me  
Cabin fever's killing me  
I gotta leave here  
Cabin fever's killing me
