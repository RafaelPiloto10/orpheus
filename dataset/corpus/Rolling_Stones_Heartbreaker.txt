The police in New York City  
They chased a boy right through the park  
In a case of mistaken identity  
They put a bullet through his heart  
  
Heartbreakers with your forty four  
I wanna tear your world apart  
You heart breaker with your forty four  
I wanna tear your world a part  
  
A ten year old girl on a street corner  
Sticking needles in her arm  
She died in the dirt of an alleyway  
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance  
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker  
She stuck the pins right in her heart  
Heartbreaker, a pain maker  
Stole the love right out of you heart  
  
Oh yeah  
Doo, doo doo doo doo  
Oh yeah  
Doo doo doo, doo doo  
I wanna tear that word apart  
  
Oh yeah  
Doo, doo doo doo doo  
Oh yeah  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
I wanna tear that word apart  
  
Heartbreaker, heart breaker  
You stole the love right out of my heart  
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker  
I wanna tear your world apart  
  
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker  
Stole the love right out, stole the love right out  
  
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo  
Ah yeah, you shot the kid, he had no chance  
Doo doo, doo doo do  
Ah yeah, Ah yeah, you stuck pins right in her heart  
Doo doo, doo doo do  
You heartbreaker, I wanna tear your world apart  
Doo doo, doo doo do........
