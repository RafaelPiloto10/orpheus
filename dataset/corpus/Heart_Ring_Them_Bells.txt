Ring them bells yea heathen  
From the city that dreams  
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries  
Cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide  
And the world's on it's side  
And time is running backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells!  
  
Ring them bells Saint Peter  
Where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
That the rush hour is now on the wheel  
And the plow and the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
  
Ring them bells Saint Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep  
And the mountains are filled with little lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who would judge the many when the game is through  
Ring them bells for the time that flies,  
For the child that cries when  
Innocence dies  
Ring them bells Saint Catherine  
From the top of the room  
Ring them bells from the fortress  
From the lilies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong  
  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells!
