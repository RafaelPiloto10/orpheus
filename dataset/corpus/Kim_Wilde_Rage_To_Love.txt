Ten little Indians  
Standin' in a row  
All dressed up  
But nowhere to go  
Lookin' for a target  
Lookin' for a man ........  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Seven little Indians  
Standin' in a row  
The compere walks on the stage and he says  
"Sing it Girls"  
But the band's no good  
And the song don't cut it  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Come on, let's go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
Baby - it's so right  
And if you feel it ...  
Good !  
Dedicate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
  
Three little indians  
Cryin' in their make-up  
Nobody stops  
And nobody cares  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Come on let's go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
Baby it's so right  
And if you feel it...  
Good !  
Dedicate it  
Oh I got this rage to...  
Oh it's just this rage to... Oh I got this rage to love
