[Donna]  
We were strangers, starting out on a journey  
Never dreaming what we'd have to go through  
Now here we are and I'm suddenly standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Richard]  
No one told me I was going to find you  
Unexpected, what you did to my heart  
  
[Both]  
When I lost hope, you were there to remind me  
This is the start  
  
And life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing  
Life is a road, now and forever  
Wonderful journey  
I'll be there when the world stops turning  
I'll be there when the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Donna]  
We were strangers on a crazy adventure  
[Richard]  
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true  
[Both]  
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
I knew there was somebody, somewhere  
Like me alone in the dark  
Now I know my dream will live on  
I've been waiting so long  
Nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[Richard]  
Yeah...  
  
[Both]  
Life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep going on  
  
[Donna]  
Starting out on a journey  
  
[Both]  
Life is a road that I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep on flowing  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning...  
With you
