Oh it's twelve o'clock  
On the old grey wall  
Yet another year  
'75 is here  
  
I hear all the people celebrating  
Another year  
Oh Darkness, darkness  
Inside my head  
  
I'm on my own again  
That's what I think I said  
This place is just a one-horse town  
So let the rain fall down  
  
Year and year again  
I'll be sitting here reflecting  
How nothing's changed  
But am I still the same  
  
People blow up all around me  
Yet I remain  
Nothing's changed  
Another day begins  
  
The same old same again  
It's like some movie scene  
I know it all frame by frame  
I'll try to figure out what it means  
  
Some other day  
Now my diary  
Is looking back at me  
Oh it's another year  
  
'76 is here  
I'm watching all the people celebrating  
Another year  
It's another year  
  
Another year  
Another year
