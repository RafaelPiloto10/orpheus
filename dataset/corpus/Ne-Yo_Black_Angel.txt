[Verse 1:]  
Nights full of fears, eyes full of tears  
Cus you been hearin the same lies for 5 years.  
Fresh out of high school he pursued his career  
And you played the house wife roll for dude and his kids  
But now you can't get a break no matter how hard you try,  
Your life's on the line everytime you start up the ride  
Cus you never got ur L's but its hard not to drive  
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside  
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya  
Just because he said that you had a mouth on ya,  
Becus you would scream and holla  
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar  
And he didn't even bother to consider his child  
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?  
You stressin now cause you can figure it out  
But keep ur head in the clouds girl  
Continue to smile girl  
Cus baby you are a  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He swept you off your feet when you met it was love at first sight  
He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type  
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight  
And you found out he was worse than ike  
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite  
Now your uncertain of this person you liked  
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive  
Cause you want it to work this time  
So you convince your mind that it fine  
But in time your gonna find  
That real love aint defined with violence  
And if you're crying every night  
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite  
To hit you in the eye then its time  
That you learn from the mistakes  
Of those that chose to stay  
Cause most of em are gone today  
And there's a gang of sistas  
That would probably still be with us  
If they would've just flown away Ne-yo gone and sang  
  
[Chorus x 2:]  
(you're fly)  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel  
  
[Bridge:]  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel
