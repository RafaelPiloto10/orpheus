I'm lost in your love  
Lost in my love for you  
Everything that you say  
Everything that you do  
I'm lost in your love  
  
I can find me a night  
So lovely it might even change me  
I can find me the place where mornings come from  
But I'm lost when it comes to you  
  
I'm lost in your love  
So lost in my love for you  
And I can't see your face  
'Cause I'm tumbling through space  
I'm lost in your love  
  
Find me  
Take me  
Hold me  
I can't let you go free  
'Til you lose your love in me  
  
I'm lost in your love  
Lost in my love for you  
Everything that you say  
Everything that you do  
I'm lost in your love
