Girl you are to me  
All that a woman should be  
And I dedicate my life to you always  
  
A love like yours is rare  
It must have been sent from up above  
And I know you'll stay this way for always  
And we both know  
That our love will grow  
And forever, it will be  
You and me  
  
Ooh, you're like the sun  
Chasing all of the rain away  
When you come around  
You bring brighter days  
  
You're the perfect one  
For me and forever will be  
And I will love you so for always  
  
Come with me my sweet  
Let's go make a family  
And they will bring us joy for always  
  
Ooh, you're like the sun  
Chasing all of the rain away  
When you come around  
You bring brighter days  
You are perfect  
For me and you forever will be  
And I will love you so for always
