It's barely morning  
Cars are roaring  
The city's moving fast  
  
My momma's calling  
But I'm stalling  
Living in the past  
  
It's time to face the world in front of me  
And make the best of this reality  
  
I'm gonna push my life today  
Push to make a better way  
Gonna push 'cause I got to carry on  
  
I'm gonna push the clouds away  
Push so I can see the way  
Gonna push until I find my way home  
  
The jungle's swarming  
Beasts are crawling  
They're all along my path  
  
But God's adoring,  
Love is pouring  
I'm gonna take a bath  
  
I am swimming in a violent sea  
Trying to find out who I'm gonna be  
  
I'm gonna push my life today  
Push to make a better way  
Gonna push 'cause I got to carry on  
  
I'm gonna push the clouds away  
Push so I can see the way  
Gonna push until I find my way home  
  
I can feel it come together  
I know God has a plan, oh yeah  
  
Oh,I see the kingdom through the shadows  
But it's all gonna pass  
I'm gonna push  
'Cause my Lord ain't gonna let it last  
  
I'm gonna push my life today  
Push to make a better way  
Gonna push 'cause I got to carry on, oh yeah  
  
I'm gonna push the clouds away  
Push so I can see the way  
Gonna push until I find my way home  
I'm gonna push 'till my Lord brings me home  
  
Oh oh, oh yeah  
'Till I find my way home
