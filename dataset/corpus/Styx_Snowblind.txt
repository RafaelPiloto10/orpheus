Mirror, mirror on the wall  
The face you've shown me scares me so  
I thought that I could call your bluff  
But now the lines are clear enough  
Life's not pretty even though  
I've tried so hard to make it so  
Mornings are such cold distress  
How did I ever get into this mess  
  
I'm snowblind, can't live without you  
So fine I just can't get away  
Now I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind  
  
Harmless and innocent you devil in white  
You stole my will without a fight  
You filled me with confidence, but you blinded my eyes  
You tricked me with visions of Paradise  
Now I realize I'm  
  
Snowblind, can't live without you  
So fine I just can't get away  
Now I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind  
  
Mirror, mirror I confess  
I can't escape this emptiness  
No more reason to pretend  
Here comes that same old feeling again  
  
Snowblind, can't live without you  
So fine I just can't get away  
Won't you throw me a lifeline  
I'm going down for the third time  
I'm snowblind, and I can't get away
