Spent all of his life in love with money  
Never found love he never got lucky no  
One hundred are the times he tried  
And every time he lost a part of him died  
  
Love can be found the people would tell  
So he threw his heart  
In the wishing well  
Young Julie the girl from the city  
  
With eyes full of pain and a heart  
Full of pity yeah and she said...  
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying  
You're gotta make your peace  
  
And and let your livin' just ease along  
Let your livin' just ease along  
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon  
Find your heart and the why, and the where,  
  
And the reason  
Oh - oh - oh  
She took him up the mountain side  
Where the air was clear and the water was wine  
  
She loved him when the night was still  
And the stars danced on the window sill  
And over and over again  
The lovers looked out from the mountain rim  
  
There was no need to reach for the stars  
You could catsh them all night and keep them in jars  
And she told him...  
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying  
  
You're gotta make your peace  
And and let your livin' just ease along  
Let your livin' just ease along  
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon  
  
Find your heart and the why, and the where,  
And the reason  
Ease along you've got to ease along  
Spent all his life in love with money-ease along  
  
Never found love never got lucky-ease along  
With eyes full of pain and her heart full of pity-  
Ease along  
Young Julie the girl from the city said-ease along
