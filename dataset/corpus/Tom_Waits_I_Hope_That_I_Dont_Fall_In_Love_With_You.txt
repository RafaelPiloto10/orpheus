Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you  
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,  
Well the music plays and you display  
Your heart for me to see,  
I had a beer and now I hear you  
Calling out for me  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
Well the room is crowded, people everywhere  
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?  
Well if you sit down with this old clown,  
Take that frown and break it,  
Before the evening's gone away,  
I think that we could make it,  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
Well the night does funny things inside a man  
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
You light a cigarette,  
I wish I had the guts to bum one,  
But we've never met,  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,  
And it being late, you'd like some some company,  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
And you look back at me,  
The guy you're with has up and split,  
The chair next to you's free,  
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.  
  
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out  
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
You're nowhere to be found,  
I search the place for your lost face,  
Guess I'll have another round  
And I think that I just fell in love with you.
