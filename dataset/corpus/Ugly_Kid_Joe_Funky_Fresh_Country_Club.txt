Funky fresh tunes  
And you're walking down the street  
And you're trying to find the girl  
That you really want to meet  
  
You're flying past the reef  
And you're drinking shrunken heads  
You wake up in the morning  
And you wish that you were dead  
  
As you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
Now the country club is cold  
And the country club is mean  
The attendants at the country club  
Ain't something to be seen  
  
If you're messing with my girl  
You're messing with your life  
Cause I'm gonna cut you  
With a big, big knife  
You bet your fuckin' life!  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
  
Going downtown in the back of a car  
Some motha'fucka' left the door ajar  
Remember what your parents said  
Be home by eight and in your bed  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine
