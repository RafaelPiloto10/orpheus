(Live and learn)  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
(Live and learn)  
  
You can never undo  
Whatever's been done  
You're so afraid  
That true love may never come  
  
Maybe tomorrow will bring  
Happiness in  
And in a little while  
You could learn to smile  
Again, oh, oh  
  
But never give up  
That's a big mistake  
Be true to your heart  
And even if it breaks  
You can still  
  
Love another day  
Find another way  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus]  
Live and learn  
When the morning comes  
You'll see things in a different light  
Give a little time  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you  
To live and learn  
  
What's done is done  
Past is past  
You can look around  
But you can never go back, keep on  
  
Living your life  
Living it right  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To live and learn  
(Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you)  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you  
(Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you)  
To live and learn  
  
Love another day  
Find another way  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus: x2]
