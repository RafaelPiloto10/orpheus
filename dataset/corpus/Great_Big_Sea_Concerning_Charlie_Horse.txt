Come all ye friends, I'll sit you down  
And sing an oleful ditty  
T'was on a day in April month  
We started from the city  
We planned a day or two at Mahers  
We stalwart men were chosen  
To remove old Charlie from Angle Pond  
Who fell in when the pond was frozen  
  
We seven men came roaring down  
On the road to Roaches Line  
We might have stopped in Avondale  
Or Brigus might have been fine  
We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in  
Nor took any time to park us  
We all of us knew that we must get through  
To remove old Charlie's carcass  
  
[Chorus]  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
Here's to Shave the Master  
No better horse ne'er ran the course  
Nor pulled the logs more faster  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
And I want ye all to know  
Charlie's gone to the big corral  
Where all good horses go  
  
In the car was Ol' Pocket Comb  
And beside him Old Moose Coosten  
And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark  
In the back seat he was roostin'  
There was Smiley Stubborn and the Mounted Police  
It wasn't hard to find him  
And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam  
Was sitting right in beside him  
Kevin and Buck was also there  
But they brought some brawn and brains  
They was aiming to help as best they could  
To remove old Chuck's remains  
Charlie was like a brother to Shave  
And he loved him well of course  
Charlie was a very good man you see  
Although he'd been a horse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'll spare you all the gruesome details  
And just relate the end  
With two stout doors and a few strong ropes  
We removed old Shady's friend  
We gave him a decent sendoff  
With all our hats removed  
So long as we helped old Shave and his friend  
Our loyalty was proved  
Somewhere up in the great beyond  
His eyes are shining bright  
Charlie nods an approving nod  
'Cause he knows we did him right  
Shave will join him there one day  
And he'll bring the harness leather  
And so for all of eternity  
They'll pull the logs together  
  
[Chorus]
