[Chorus]  
Take this message to my mother  
It will fill her heart with joy  
Tell her that I've met my savior  
God has saved her wand'ring boy.  
  
The tears and sorrow I have caused her  
How I wish I could re-pay  
But tell her I'll be waiting for her  
We'll meet in heaven some glad day.  
  
How she cried when I left her  
I know it filled her heart with pain  
She said, son, please don't leave me  
For we may never meet again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Years have passed since that parting  
But I know she waits and prays  
Soon I'll cross that dark river  
Please let her know that I was saved.  
  
[Chorus]
