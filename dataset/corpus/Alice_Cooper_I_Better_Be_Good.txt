If I ain't cool  
My daddy gonna send me  
To Military School  
If I ain't nice  
My girlie gonna freeze me  
With cold shoulder ice  
If I'm real late  
My teacher gonna use me  
For alligator bait  
So, I better be good  
I better be good  
  
If I jump on the gas  
The cops are gonna jump  
All over my back  
If I smoke too much  
Doctor says he's gonna  
Put my lungs in a crutch  
If I'm caught without my pants  
Consuelo's dad is gonna shoot  
Until he sees me dance  
  
So, I better be good  
I had better be good  
You better be nice

If I spray it on the seat  
Lady gonna tie a big knot  
In the meat  
If I spewey too fast  
Lover's gonna stick  
My Wrangler in a cast  
If zipper grabs skin  
I'll know I had it out  
When I shoulda kept it in  
Ow.
