If your the girl that I know this (the rest of this line is unclear),  
Than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
If your the chick I saw in the tall grass looking at someone through tinted
blue glass, than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
  
Cause I've never been this close before, to someone who didn't seem to mind.
I've never found hellos before, I've only found goodbyes.  
If your the girl I met in my daydreams, handing out flowers and chocolate ice
cream, than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
If your the girl that I talked to and said do you mind if I love you, than
your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.
