Sound is ripping through your ears  
The deafening sound of metal nears  
Your bodies waiting for his whips  
The taste of leather on your lips  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
Victims falling under chains  
You hear them crying death pains  
The fists of terrors breaking through  
Now there's nothing you can do  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
The leather armies have prevailed  
The Phantom Lord has never failed  
Smoke is lifting from the ground  
The rising volume metal sound  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
Fall to your knees  
And bow to the Phantom Lord
