One life, one chance, one time.  
One life to see it all.  
One shot at tomorrow.  
You will never see this time again.  
  
A belief that time is cruelty.  
Happiness is just one step away.  
This life will never falter.  
Determinated that time will never fall.  
  
This way will never fail me.  
I will testify.  
I swear that I can see the light.  
It's born.  
  
It will be forever.  
A personal basking thrown.  
Life can give us.  
Walk the line, break the walls.  
  
See the things you've never known.  
Break these walls with life.  
One step away.
