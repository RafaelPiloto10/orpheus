Say what (yea) now ease back  
To the rear, you hear  
Eardrums drown, the bass pound  
Really stupid, we gonna loop this  
? scoop it, is that we rock it  
While ducks jock this  
Biting and writing and fighting for this  
Beats and wax, rhymes are facts  
Biting acts  
How we did it, for this one, that one  
Biters around, check out the sound  
In town, to the rhythm that we give 'em  
In fact you lack  
(Ultramagnetic) skills  
'Cause your record's no frills  
Here's your bill now ease back  
Ease back  
  
(Kool Keith)  
  
I'm back  
Back to smack attack  
Those who wack and lack my experience  
On the microphone holding my own ground  
Dominating forces  
Change the sources, punks takes losses  
Enough cause it's me on the mic  
Feeding on words, small like a nerd  
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme  
Continuing the land of time  
For my incredible, highly elevated  
Smooth in the mind, more sophisicated  
Motivated, as I relate it verbal  
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel  
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo  
Shining, fog lights in the front  
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt  
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that  
I have it like, I need it like that  
It's better like that, I made it like that  
I bought it like that, I'm living like that  
For you wack MC's  
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic  
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes  
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran  
And better than, including the rest of them  
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them  
One by one, I'm teaching my son  
To ease back  
Ease back  
  
(Seth G)  
  
What's up, it's me again  
I'm Seth G wit a funky blend  
Of beats and rhymes on time wit my DJ  
He's not weak wit anything he plays  
Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous  
Like a professor, he had perfected this  
Simple potion, through devotion  
Wit his blends, his motions and fastly approaching  
Coasting, reaching higher levels  
So when you see 'em, you best say hello  
I'm a take out a knife,pen and paper and write  
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope  
Ducks, who are you really kidding  
You say you're dope, well you're admitting  
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak  
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete  
Weap and learn a new rap style  
From Seth G, the wizard of know how  
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation  
When I ease back  
Ease back
