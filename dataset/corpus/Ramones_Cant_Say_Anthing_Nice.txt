I'm walking away from you  
Don't want to be abused  
Doberman eyes  
Eagle claws  
And your snake body says it all  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that it's too late now  
Everybody's putting you down  
  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice  
  
Absent minded like a zombie  
I can't control myself with you  
A give give give, a take take take  
Babe I'm through, through with you  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that it's too late now  
Everybody thinks you're a clown  
  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice  
  
I'm walking away from you  
Don't want to be abused  
Doberman eyes  
Eagle claws  
And your snake body says it all  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that it's too late now  
Everybody's putting you down  
  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice  
You can't say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you can't say anything nice
