I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin' plow  
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now.  
Got a cultivator and a double tree  
A leather line for the hull and gee  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day  
I got about a dollar laid away  
The winds from the south and the fishing's good  
Got a pot belly stove and a quart of wood  
Mama turns left-overs into hash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
I got a machine and a hunting dog  
A cap I ordered from the catalog  
A good tall tree that shades the yard  
A good fat sow for the winters lard  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
Well there's not much new ground left to plow  
And the crops need fertilizer now  
My hands don't earn too much gold  
For security when I grow old  
But we'll all be equal under the grass  
And God's got a heaven for Country Trash  
And God's got a heaven for Country Trash  
I'll be doing alright for Country Trash
