Take the sun  
Take the moon  
Take the earth and watch it move  
Under Your control  
Cause You're all I know  
  
Here's my life and all my heart  
I give it all but every part  
Is under Your control  
Lord You're all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
'til You tell them to  
The faith in my heart will still sing  
Of what Your love can do  
And even when life weighs heavy on me  
I know You're in control  
And You're all I need  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
'til You tell them to  
  
Take the sea  
Take the tide  
Take the waters watch them rise  
Giving praise to You  
Always praising You  
Here's my voice  
And all my soul  
Singing freely when  
Lord, I'm giving praise to You  
Lord I'm praising You  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The clouds will rain  
The seasons change  
(Cause You told them to)  
The sun will shine  
Your burning light  
(Cause You told it to)  
When You speak your words through my soul  
So I know it's true  
You're in control  
In control  
In control  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
The faith in my heart will sting sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there
