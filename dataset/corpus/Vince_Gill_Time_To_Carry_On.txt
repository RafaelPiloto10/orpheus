Painted as the victim  
He said you caused it all  
Lying to convince 'em  
So you would take the fall  
You walked out with nothin'  
Hopin' for some peace of mind  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
The scars won't last forever  
The truth will take their place  
Angry words will be forgotten  
Contempt will fade away  
The promise of tomorrow  
It will always remain  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
The promise of tomorrow  
'T will always remain  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
It's time to carry on
