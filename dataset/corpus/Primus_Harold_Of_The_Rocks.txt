It was a weekends eve  
I had sex on my breath  
I was looking for something to see.  
With a borrowed black leather  
And my best fishing hat  
It was just Wendy-O and me.  
  
We called ol' swamp up on the telephone and said we was coming on down to pick
him up and then,  
He said "Hey Snappy, me and Greeny'll come along but only if we can bring a
friend. His name is Harold"  
  
So I Said "OK"  
  
Now, we had a Swamper, Greeny, Wendy-O, Stanley, Harold of the Rocks and me.  
We hopped into my dart and headed for the nightbreak to see a man they called
Schooly D.  
Harold he's a friendly guy, he rambles on and on, he'll talk the balls off a
rhinosaurus.  
Fact is he just doesn't make much sense, well Stan said " This guys pretty
bizarre Gus."  
  
Harold Of The Rocks  
  
I saw Harold at a party Trouzy threw late one night.  
I said "Hey man do you remember me"  
He said " well of course l do snap dad let me tell ya right about now I'm lit
up like an old christmas tree."  
"Het bro you know Id like to thank you once again for letting me hang with
ya'all across the bay. When I look back at that night I get a warm spot across
my heart"  
Then he shook my hand, and walked away.  
That's the last I seen of Harold.  
  
Harold Of The Rocks  
  
So in the end, Swamper and Greeny finally succumb to the ways of Harold.  
And in doing so each gave just a little bit of his soul away.  
What a couple of dumbshits!
