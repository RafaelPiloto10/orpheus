Southdown motor co  
2a bus  
You can see right inside  
My parent's house  
Sitting at the table and my dinner's up  
It's gonna be different when  
The kid's grown up  
Gonna save some money  
And quit this job  
Light the way  
Clear the stage  
The kid's grown up  
Used to play in the underground  
Hyde park  
Now I'm riding in a limousine  
Through the underpass  
I'm sitting in an aeroplane  
It's all such a rush  
People all around me making  
So much fuss  
And I've got a little money  
But it ain't gonna burn me up  
If I'm in your town  
Tonight I am -- watch out  
The kid's grown up
