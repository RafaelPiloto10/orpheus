Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall  
All his children grew and grew, they ain't never grown so tall before  
They may never grow so tall again  
  
We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day  
Taught us all we ever knew, we ain't never known so much before  
We may never know so much again  
  
The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate  
Mason's children ran and flew, they ain't never run so fast before  
Swore they'd never show their face again  
Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he  
  
Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me  
Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright  
Mason's children cooked the stew and cleaned up when the feast was through  
Take me to the repo-man to pay back what is owed  
If he's in some other land write it off as stole
