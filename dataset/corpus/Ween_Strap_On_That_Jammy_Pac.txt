Strap on that there jammy pac  
Get a grip on your soul  
Sip on that there family flask,  
And I'll guide you towards the door  
She don't feed me in the mornin  
And I cant take no more  
So strap on that there jammy pac,  
And get up off my floor  
  
Strap on that there jammy pac  
And slide a double dime my way  
Dry off your distributor cap,  
And hip me to the game you play  
She's jonesin' for a jammy  
With a girl that I call tammy,  
So strap on that there jammy pac,  
Its time for you to pay  
  
Strap on that there jammy pac  
She hypnotized one dude  
Stains you like a heart attack  
Van winkle says fuck you.  
Never made me no supper  
A boy like me needs it, too  
So strap on that there jammy pac,  
Its time to pay your due
