There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all of the parties every night  
They're not enough  
You want something more (Tell me)  
I want you  
I want you  
  
(Tell)  
(Tell)  
  
I find you when I want you  
And lose you late at night  
The woman in me shouts out  
The man in me just smiles  
I may not always love you  
You may not care  
But if we should live together  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby))  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
We'll find a home together  
(Baby) And sleep there every night  
(Baby) There's a time and place for most things  
(Baby) This time we'll get it right  
(Aah) You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Baby)  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together?  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby)  
(Ooh, baby, baby, why don't we live?)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
(Baby) You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Ooh ooh))  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby, baby))  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide ((Baby))  
  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby, Ooh, baby)  
(Saying why don't we live together)  
  
You won't believe until the day you try ((Baby, baby))  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
Why don't we live together?  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Ooh ooh)  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby)  
Without the love, love you feel inside
