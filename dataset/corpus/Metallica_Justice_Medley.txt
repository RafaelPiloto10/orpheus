Opposition... Contradiction... Premonition... Compromise  
Agitation... Violation... Masturbation... On our face  
Darkest Color  
Blistered Earth  
True Death of Life  
  
Never Hunger  
Never Prosper  
I Have Fallen Prey to Failure  
Struggle Within  
Triggered Again  
Now the Candle Burns at Both Ends  
  
Halls of Justice Painted Green  
Money Talking  
Power Wolves Beset Your Door  
Hear Them Stalking  
Soon You'll Please Their Appetite  
They Devour  
Hammer of Justice Crushes You  
Overpower  
  
The Ultimate in Vanity  
Exploiting Their Supremacy  
I Can't Believe the Things You Say  
I Can't Believe  
I Can't Believe the Price You Pay  
Nothing Can Save You  
Justice Is Lost  
Justice Is Raped  
Justice Is Gone  
Pulling Your Strings  
Justice Is Done  
Seeking No Truth  
Winning Is All  
Find it So Grim  
So True  
So Real  
  
Apathy Their Stepping Stone  
So Unfeeling  
Hidden Deep Animosity  
So Deceiving  
Through Your Eyes Their Light Burns  
Hoping to Find  
Inquisition Sinking You  
With Prying Minds  
  
The Ultimate in Vanity  
Exploiting Their Supremacy  
I Can't Believe the Things You Say  
I Can't Believe  
I Can't Believe the Price You Pay  
Nothing Can Save You  
Justice Is Lost  
Justice Is Raped  
Justice Is Gone  
Pulling Your Strings  
Justice Is Done  
Seeking No Truth  
Winning Is All  
Find it So Grim  
So True  
So Real  
  
Blackened Is the End  
Winter it Will Send  
Throwing All You See  
Into Obscurity  
  
Death of Mother Earth  
Never a Rebirth  
Evolution's End  
Never Will it Mend  
  
Never  
  
Fire  
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead  
Blackened Is the End  
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead  
Color Our World Blackened  
Fire  
Is the Outcome of Hypocrisy  
Darkest Potency  
In the Exit of Humanity  
Color Our World Blackened  
Blackened
