It's Christmas in Ignace  
Mommy's got a rock  
She'll give it to Daddy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Daddy's got a rock  
He'll give it to Mommy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time (here in Ignace)  
As we decorate the Christmas Rock  
It's a happy time  
And if the children are good they'll get toys to play with  
Like rocks  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Bob's got a rock  
But he's gonna keep it  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Jill's got a rock  
She gives it to Bob  
Now he's got two  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time  
As we sit and watch Rocky 1,2,3,4,5  
It's a happy time  
Except for Malcolm  
His tongue is stuck to the sign that says,  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
And all through the houses  
Not a creature is stirring  
Except for the rats  
That live here in Ignace  
Under the rocks  
That are played with by children  
And thrown at Malcolm  
Who's still stuck to the sign that says  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)
