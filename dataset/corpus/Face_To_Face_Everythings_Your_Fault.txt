Have you heard them talk about it?  
You say they're wrong but they know all about it  
Have you tried another story?  
We're tired of all the lies and allegories  
  
Every single thing's your fault  
There you are not really jaded  
You've learned to live with being underrated  
But they don't know just what you're made of  
Because of them who knows how you will end up?  
  
Every single thing's your fault  
With you it's always something  
When everyone's the same  
Don't you try to blame me
