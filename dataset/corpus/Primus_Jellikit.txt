I just want to satisfy you  
I would like to rectify you  
Pay no attention to what you've heard  
This mediocrity is so absurd.  
  
But I won't listen to erratic advice  
Don't make me ask you nice  
I just want to satisfy you  
I would like to contemplate you  
  
Perhaps sometime we'll irritate you  
I won't listen to sparratic advice  
Don't make me ask you twice  
I just want to satisfy you
