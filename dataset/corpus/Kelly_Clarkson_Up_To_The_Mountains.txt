I went up to the mountains  
Because you asked me to  
Up over the clouds  
To were the sky was blue  
I can see all 'round me  
Everywere  
I could see around me  
Everywere  
Sometimes I feel like I'v been nothing but tired  
And i'll be working 'till the day I expire  
So sometimes I just lay down  
Lord what more can I do?  
But then go on again  
Because you asked me to  
Somedays I look down  
Afraid a-afraid I will fall  
And though the sun shines  
I see nothing at all  
But I hear your, your sweet voice  
Oh, oh, ooo  
Coming and goin'  
Coming and goin'  
Lord telling me softly  
You love me so
