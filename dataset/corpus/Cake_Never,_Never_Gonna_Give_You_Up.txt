I've got to keep you pleased  
In every way I can  
Gonna give you all of me  
As much as you can stand  
  
Make love to you right now  
That's all I want to do  
I know you need it, girl  
And you know I need it, too  
  
'Cause I found  
What the world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear  
I don't have to look no more  
  
And, oh, my babe  
I hoped and I prayed  
For someone just like you  
To make me feel the way you do  
  
I'm never, never gonna give ya up  
I'm never, ever gonna stop  
Not the way I feel about you  
Girl, I just can't live without you

'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick  
I'm gonna stay right here with you  
Do all the things you want me to  
  
Whatever you want  
Girl, you got it  
And whatever you need  
I don't want to see you without it  
  
You've given me much more  
Than words could ever say  
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here  
Until my dying day  
  
I don't know just how to say  
All the things I feel  
I just know that I love you so  
And it gives me such a thrill  
  
'Cause I found  
What this world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear  
I don't have to look no more  
  
And all of my days  
I hoped and I prayed  
For someone just like you  
To make me feel the way you do  
  
I'm never, never gonna give ya up  
I'm never, ever gonna stop  
Stop the way I feel about you  
Girl, I just can't live without you  
  
I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick  
I'm gonna stay right here with you  
Do all the things you want me to  
  
Oh, I'm never gonna give ya up  
I'm never, ever gonna stop  
All the things I feel about you  
Girl, I just can't live without you  
  
I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
