Good girls don't stay for breakfast  
They know it's in poor taste  
Good girls won't blow your evening  
With small talkin' chit chat just a waste  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna walk with you  
And I don't wanna talk with you  
And I don't wanna be with you  
'till the night time  
  
Good girls have reputation  
Good girls have to keep it clean  
But you girl you're so damn reckless  
You're a boll weevil evilly obscene  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Hey girl you know I've heard those stories  
About you girl last of the pony-tail queens  
China chops are a dime a dozen  
So hey girl go on and shake that thing  
  
(repeat chorus)
