Let me tell you something  
  
In the darkness of the room  
I'm leaning back against the wall  
Try to walk on broken glass  
A cut so deep just hurts so bad  
  
I remember what you said  
Tears were rollin' down your face  
And after all's been said and done  
You're a woman, I'm a man  
Could I turn back the time again  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
And I step outside the door (step outside the door)  
Blinded by a million lights  
In the valley of the fools (in the valley of the fools)  
Another day went by so fast  
What in the world will ever last  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
There's nothin' else that we have got  
But our love is like a rock  
Standing up against the tide
