You were so beautiful  
Like a child young and full of life  
Seems a hundred years ago  
You saw everything  
So much more tragedy than good  
You even watched the world grow cold  
And even when your world was shaken'  
Even when your breath was taken  
Even when your blue eyes turned to grey  
  
Small town debutantes and queens  
Every woman has a name  
Cocktail waitresses with dreams  
Every woman has a name  
And every girl who's loves survives  
A broken heart to stay alive  
You signed your picture in the frame  
Every woman has a name  
  
You had a love affair  
Some of were perfect  
but most of them were pain  
It seems a hundred years ago  
It took you to the highest hill  
Left you standing frozen in the rain  
But you still feel the afterglow  
And even when your world was shakin'  
Even when your breath was taken  
Even when your blue eyes turned to gray  
  
Housewives cryin' on the phone  
Every woman has a name  
Sacred sisters all alone  
Every woman has a name  
And even on the coldest day  
When the kids are gone, moved away  
It's lonely now  
There's no one there to hold your hand  
And play  
  
See it written on the grave  
Every woman has a name
