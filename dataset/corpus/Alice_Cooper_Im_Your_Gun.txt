Your momma thinks I'l filthy (all right)  
Your daddy thinks I'm scum (all right)  
Wrap your fingers all around me, I'm your g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gun....  
  
Well...  
I'm dressed in black  
I'm a heart attack  
And my draw is lightning quick  
If you're looking for a man with magic hands  
I can really do the trick  
And if you see me on the street  
And you're burnin' from the heat  
There's a fire down below  
You be the target on the bed  
I'll be shootin' hot lead  
Let me take control  
  
You're a scared little girl in this big, bad town  
(You.......... need............. some............... one)  
So easy to sink, so easy to drown  
(Who will be strong)  
  
Pull my trigger, I get bigger  
Then I'm lots of fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Bite my bullet  
Push an' pull it  
Tell me I'm the one  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Hold on steady, always ready, yeah  
  
Well, I'm as hard as they come  
I'm a hit and run  
I'm a pistol packin' boy  
Better walk real slow  
I'm on the edge, why'know  
And I'm easily annoyed  
If something's giving you trouble  
I'll be there on the double  
Just call me on the line  
I've got a muscle I can flex  
It'll fog your little specs  
Till you think you're going blind  
  
I know these streets like the scars on my back  
(You.......... need............. some............... one)  
And I stay as loaded as this gun on my back  
(Who..........will................. be.....................strong)  
  
Pull my trigger, I get bigger  
Then I'm lots of fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Bite my bullet  
Push and pull it  
Tell me I'm the one  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Squeeze it tighter  
Aim and fire, yeah  
  
Hold on steady, always ready,  
yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Pull my trigger, I get bigger  
Then I'm lots of fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Rub my barrel  
Straight and narrow  
Dress up like a nun, n-n-n-nun  
I'm your gun  
Your gun, gun, gun  
Load my clip and lick your lips  
This is gettin' fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Hold on steady (Hold on)  
Always ready, yeah
