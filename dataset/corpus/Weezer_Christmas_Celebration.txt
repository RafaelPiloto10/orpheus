Christmas celebration  
All around the nation  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
'Cause I'm running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
  
Carolers are singing  
Registers ka-chinging  
And the presents are in place  
But I'd rather eat some mace  
'Cause that egg nog always makes me sick  
  
You know how the story goes  
You've seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he can't get out the door  
  
Christmas to perfection  
I'm begging for some action  
And the ringing in my ears  
Is the sound of Christmas cheer  
'Cause they knocked me screaming overboard  
  
You know how the story goes  
You've seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he can't get out the door  
  
You know how the story goes  
You've seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he can't get out the door  
  
Christmas celebration  
All around the nation  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
'Cause I'm running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore, yeah  
The pagentry is such a bore, yeah!
