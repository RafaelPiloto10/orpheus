Oh, c'est si bon (c'est si bon)  
Lovers say that in France (do do do)  
Aw, when they thrill to romance (c'est si bon)  
It means it's, oh, so good (do do do)  
  
Oh, c'est si bon (c'est si bon)  
So I say it to you (do do do)  
Like the French people do (c'est si bon)  
Because it's, oh, so good (do do do)  
  
Every word, every sigh  
Every kiss, dear  
Leads to only one thought  
And is this, dear  
  
Oh, it's so good (it's so good)  
Nothing else can replace (do do do)  
Just your slightest embrace (c'est si bon)  
And if you only would  
  
Be my own for the rest of my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling, c'est si bon  
  
(C'est si bon)  
Now how about saying that in English, honey  
(Lovers say that in France)  
Sounds like Greek to me, baby  
(When they thrill to romance)  
Romance, now I got you, honey  
(It means that it's so good)  
  
Oh, now my own for the rest of my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling, c'est si bon  
(Ooh, c'est si bon)  
  
Lemme hear it again, baby  
(Ooh, c'est si bon)  
I'm beginning to like this French jazz  
(Ooh, c'est si bon)  
Yeah, one more time  
(Ooh, c'est si bon)
