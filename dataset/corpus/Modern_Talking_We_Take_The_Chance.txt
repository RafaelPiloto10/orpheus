We'll take the chance, we will again  
It's our dream and you will see, we'll go hand in hand  
  
I know we're here but I feel, we're not alone  
Millions of people are waiting, in their homes  
See all the winners and losers, they're always in our hearts  
Oh, everybody's waiting, waiting for a start  
  
We'll take the chance, we'll win again  
I know my dream, it will come true  
We'll take the chance, don't lose the game  
It's a game for me and you  
We'll take the chance, we'll win again  
I know we're going, hand in hand  
We'll take the chance, and we are friends  
For a game that never ends  
  
I know we're high and we're low and just between  
We're feeling the fire of hearts, like a dream  
We're living in deep emotion, we're fighting with our hearts  
Oh, everybody's waiting, waiting for a start
