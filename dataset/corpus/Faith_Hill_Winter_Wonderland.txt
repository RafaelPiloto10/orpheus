Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away, is the bluebird  
Here to stay, is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids come knock him down  
  
When it's cold, ain't it thrilling  
When your nose, gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland
