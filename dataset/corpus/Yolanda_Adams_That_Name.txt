There is a name that is so precious,  
a name so wonderful to me.  
This name is worthy of all praises.  
Because of him, I am made free.  
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.  
The one who gave, his life for me.  
Because of love, so unconditional,  
I will have life, eternally.  
  
This name speaks peace, unto my storm clouds,  
This name speaks calm, unto me fears.  
And when I feel, that no one loves me.  
His loving presence is so near.  
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.  
The one who gave, his life for me.  
Because of love, so unconditional,  
I will have life, eternally.  
  
Praise that name!  
Praise that name!  
Praise that name!  
Praise that name!  
  
Someday I'll leave, this earthly dwelling,  
To find a place, my soul will soar.  
And finally see, the face of Jesus.  
And praise his name, forevermore!  
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him!  
The one who gave, his life for me!  
Because of love, so unconditional,  
I will have life, eternally.  
Excellent is that name!  
Glorious is that name!  
Wonderful is that name!  
Oh praise that name!
