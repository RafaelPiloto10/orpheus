Caressing the marble and stone,  
Love that was special for one,  
The waste in the fever I heat,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Body that curls in and dies,  
And shares that awful daylight,  
Warm like a dog round your feet,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Hangman looks round as he waits,  
Cord stretches tight then it breaks,  
Someday we will die in your dreams,  
How I wish we were here with you now.
