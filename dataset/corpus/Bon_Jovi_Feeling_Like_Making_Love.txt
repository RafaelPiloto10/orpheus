Baby When I think about you I think about love  
Darlin' Gonna live without you And your love  
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you In the Heavens  
And feel it dying dying dying all the way  
  
Feel like makin' Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love to you  
  
Baby If I think about you I think about love  
Darlin' If I had to live without you I live without love  
And if I had the sun and moon We will shine them  
I would give you both night and day - Love satisfying  
  
Feel like makin' Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love to you  
  
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you In the Heavens  
Feel it dying dying dying all the way
