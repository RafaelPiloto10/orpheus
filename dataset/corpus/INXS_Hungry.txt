The world is a hungry place and it's never satisfied  
You're leaving home, on the run, your mama, she was right  
Home was a crowded space but it sometimes gratified  
Look around, freedom found, now you've gone  
  
you don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you know  
  
Your life is a precious thing, you can never be denied  
You need a job, a place to live, you couldn't help but try  
Home was a crowded place and it sometimes satisfied  
Turn around, freedom found, now you've gone  
  
Baby, turn back, don't ride the highway  
Baby, good luck when you do it your way  
  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
I don't belong to you, it's only an ocean away  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
  
When there's nothing in your way and all of it burns inside  
Reaching out on your own, reaching out, you're reaching out on your own  
  
Lust is a hungry place and it's never satisfied  
You need to find the gift of love that comes from deep inside  
Your heart is a special place and you're always there, I'm always there for
you  
  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you know  
I don't belong to you, it's only an ocean away  
You don't belong to me, I've just gotta let you go  
  
Baby, turn back, don't ride the highway  
Baby, good luck when you do it your way
