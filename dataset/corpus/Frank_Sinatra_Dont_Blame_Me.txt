Don't blame me  
For falling in love with you  
I'm under your spell  
But how can I help it  
Don't blame me  
  
Can't you see  
When you do the things you do?  
And I can't conceal  
The thrill that I'm feeling  
Don't blame me  
  
I can't help it  
If that doggone moon above  
Makes me need  
Someone like you to love  
  
Blame your kiss  
As sweet as a kiss can be  
And blame all your charms  
That melt in my arms  
But don't blame me
