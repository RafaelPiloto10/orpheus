Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Just something about the boy  
  
It's the verse in my head  
The words that make me stutter  
The swag in my step  
The change from gray to color  
A guaranteed bet  
Oh, I found my lucky number  
The feeling that you get  
Can't help but make me wonder  
  
No need to try  
He's just right  
He's got that something  
I can't let nobody tell me no  
No I don't mind  
Takes me high  
I won't stop until the boy is mine  
  
He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool  
Taking me down I can't stop  
He got me up  
I can't come down  
He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice  
There's just something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
There's just something about the boy  
  
It's the first time we met  
The lightening to my thunder  
The green light on red  
The kiss that pulls me under  
It's only for me  
If you're the test I got the answer  
And I'm all that you need  
Now you finally get the chance to  
  
No need to try  
He's just right  
He's got that something  
I can't let nobody tell me no  
No I don't mind  
Takes me high  
I won't stop until the boy is mine  
  
He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool  
Taking me down I can't stop  
He got me up  
I can't come down  
He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice  
There's just something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
There's just something about the boy  
  
I know you like to play it slow  
But I'm running out of time  
It's like I lost my self control  
'Cause you are the one  
And you know what you've done  
My poor heart's come undone  
Baby please  
  
He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool  
Taking me down I can't stop  
He got me up  
I can't come down  
He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice  
There's just something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
There's just something about the boy  
  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Just something about the boy
