The sun creeps in,  
She says I love you with a smile on her face.  
If time could stand still  
We could lay under the covers all day  
  
She makes this house a home  
In winter keeps me warm  
In summer makes it hot for me  
In the fall and spring fresh loving she brings  
When I open up my eyes she sings  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Sometimes I wake  
A little grumpy, moody  
She says no way  
Cause she's so positive  
She gives me love  
Gets me ready for my day  
  
She makes this house a home  
In winter keeps me warm  
In summer makes it hot for me  
In the fall and spring fresh loving she brings  
When I open up my eyes she sings  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
If she cooks your breakfast with love  
Gives you kisses with love  
Rubs your back with love  
Than you better wake up  
Say you (love her)  
Tell her that you (love her)  
Cause every breath that you breathe  
Everyday that you see  
Is not guaranteed  
Oh no  
Every morning  
Every morning  
Tell her  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Tell her good morning  
Good morning
