King of the Bongo  
(M. Chao)  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin' my first bongo  
  
Every monkey'd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby  
I'm the king of bongo bong  
  
I went to the big town  
Where there is a lot of sound  
From the jungle to the city  
Looking for a bigger crown  
  
Play my boogie  
For the people of big city  
But they don't go crazy  
When I'm bangin' in my boogie  
  
I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
  
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie  
I'm the king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
I'm the king of the bongo, I'm the king of the bongo bong  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
  
They say that I'm a clown  
Making too much dirty sound  
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town  
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie  
I'm the king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
  
Hear me when I come  
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
  
Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me  
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me  
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
But I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong  
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come, baby, king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong...  
Hear me when I come  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin' my first bongo  
  
Every monkey'd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby  
I'm the king of bongo bong  
  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come

Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour
