Love came and hit me  
Straight on the lips  
The longer we're kissin'  
The better it gets, and baby that's all right  
You got me standing beside myself  
You know it ain't like me  
It's like I'm somebody else  
But baby that's all right  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I plead guilty babe, of this terrible crime  
You been lovin' me all of this time  
I must've been blind  
What's gonna happen?  
What'll I do?  
Whatever it is, I wanna do it with you  
I feel just fine  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
And ain't it peculiar how loves comes about?  
When you're not lookin', you'd better look out!  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Feels so good now that I got you to myself  
I'm gonna keep you for myself  
Now that I got you  
I don't wanna let you go  
Don't wanna let you go  
  
You're not the man I was looking for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
Now that I got you babe, I don't wanna let you go
