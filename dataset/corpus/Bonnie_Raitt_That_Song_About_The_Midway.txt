I met you on a midaway at a fair last year  
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear  
You were playing on the horses  
You were playing on the guitar strings  
  
You were playing like the devil wearing wings  
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings  
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?  
  
Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky  
I followed through a sideshow to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice  
  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice  
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in  
  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?  
Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news  
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine  
  
But I feel like I've been working overtime  
Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime  
And I envy you the valley that you've found  
'Cause I'm midway down the midway  
  
Slowin' down
