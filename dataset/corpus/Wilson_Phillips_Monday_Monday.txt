Monday, Monday  
So good to me.  
Monday, Monday  
It was all I hoped it would be.  
  
Oh Monday morning  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me.  
  
Monday, Monday  
Can't trust that day.  
Monday, Monday  
Sometimes it just turns out that way.  
  
On Monday morning  
You gave me no warning  
Of what was to be.  
On Monday, Monday  
How could you leave  
And not take me?  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine, yeah.  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time.  
  
Monday, Monday  
So good to me.

It was all I hoped it would be.  
Oh Monday morning,  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me.  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day

Can't trust that day.  
Monday, Monday,  
Just turns out that way.  
  
Oh, Monday, Monday,  
Don't go away.  
Oh, Monday, Monday  
It's here to stay  
Monday, Monday  
Oh, don't go away
