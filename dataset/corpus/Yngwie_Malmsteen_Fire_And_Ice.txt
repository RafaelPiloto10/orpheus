Everyday is like a set up race  
And the world is still a lonely place  
To be or not to be is this the final quiz.  
A flash in the pan goodbye  
Still shooting for the open sky  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
I cannot find a compromise.  
It's all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Don't know the reason  
My life is fire and ice.  
There's a voice that whispers I can fail  
I believe it's just a trick of the tail  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
There is no way no compromise.  
It's all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Don't know the reason  
My life is fire and ice.
