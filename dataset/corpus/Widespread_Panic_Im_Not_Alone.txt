I see what I do, first look at the phone  
Turn on your TV  
Unscrew a bottle of beer,  
An orange square cellophane cheese  
First I think of this, and then I turn to that  
Maybe I just don't think  
Might sing to this, I might sing to that  
If I could only sing  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone  
  
There was a day when I was alone  
A few sane days ago  
There was a love I've been living with  
That I lost on the way home  
First I thought of this  
And then I turn to that  
And then I turn a little bit scared  
Well, I feel a little bit easier  
Knowing that you're here  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone  
  
First I think of this  
Then I turn to that  
Then I turn a little scared  
I feel a little easier now  
Knowing that you're all here  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone
