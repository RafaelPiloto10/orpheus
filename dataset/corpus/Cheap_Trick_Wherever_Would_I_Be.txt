When my world is turning  
When it's turning upside down  
When all I see is rain  
When I think the night won't end  
I just think of you  
And I can see the sun again  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere  
When the dreams I dream  
All seem a million miles away  
When I'm sure, I'll never win  
When it's looking like  
I've left my faith  
I just look at you baby  
And I got reason to believe again  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Without you to love me  
I'd just be wasting time  
And goin' out of my mind  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you
