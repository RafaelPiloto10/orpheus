Ol' December's here at last  
Time for celebration  
Christmas present  
Christmas past  
Tumble down together like the snow  
What a show  
Now the snowman Karen made  
Is melting by the roadside  
On the wind a serenade  
Of children's voices singing I believe  
I believe in love  
I believe  
  
On Christmas morning  
You awaken with a smile  
You hold me in your arms  
We watch the snowflakes fly  
And then you love me and I realize how sweet a life can be  
All the memories  
Coming back again this year  
  
Sentimental melodies  
Surround me like an old friend  
Spent a winter here with me  
Silently we watched the seasons change  
And they change so fast  
Fade away  
  
On Christmas morning  
You awaken with a smile  
You hold me in your arms  
We watch the snowflakes fly  
And then you love me  
And I realize how sweet a life can be  
All the memories will always take me back, hold me back in time  
  
On Christmas morning  
You awaken with a smile  
You hold me in your arms  
We watch the snowflakes fly  
And then you love me  
And I realize how sweet a life can be  
Ooh the memories will always take me back in time  
To Christmas morning  
On Christmas morning
