We met some time ago when we were almost young  
It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from  
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine
