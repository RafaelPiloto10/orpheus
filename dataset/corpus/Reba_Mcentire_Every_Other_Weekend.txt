Every other Friday  
It's toys and clothes in backpacks  
Is everybody in okay?  
Let's go see dad  
Same time in the same spot  
Corner of the same old parking lot  
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad  
We trade a couple words and looks  
And kids again  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other weekend  
Very few exceptions  
I pick up the love we made in both my arms  
It's movies on the sofa  
Grilled cheese and cut the crust off  
But that's not the way mom makes it, Daddy breaks my heart  
I miss everything we used to have with her again  
Every other weekend  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't tell her I love her  
I can't tell him I love him  
Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car  
So, I don't tell him I miss him  
I don't tell her I need her  
She's over me that's where we are  
He's over me that's where we are  
We're as close as we might ever be again  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other Saturday  
First thing in the morning  
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away  
I know why but I don't know why  
We ever let this happen  
Fallin' for forever was a big mistake  
There's so much not to do and all day not do it in  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other Sunday  
I empty out my backseat  
While my children hug their mother in the parking lot  
We don't touch, we don't talk much  
Maybe goodbye to each other  
As she drives away with every piece of heart I've got  
I re-convince myself we did the right thing  
Every other weekend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, for fifteen minutes, we're a family again  
God I wish that he was still with me again  
Every other weekend
