Oh yeah yeah...  
Last night I took a walk in the snow,  
Couples holdin hands, places to go,  
Seems like everyone but me is in love  
Santa can you hear me?  
I signed my letter that I sealed with kiss,  
I sent it off, it just said this:  
"i know exactly what I want this year"  
Santa can you hear me?  
I want my baby, baby  
I want someone to love me, someone to hold,  
Maybe maybe,  
He'll be all my own in a big red bow  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year  
And all I want is one thing,  
Tell me my true love is here  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
  
Yeahh...  
Christmas eve, I just can't sleep  
Would I be wrong for takin a peek  
'cause I heard that you're comin to town  
Santa can you hear me?  
I really hope that you're on your way  
With something special for me in your sleigh  
Oh please make my wish come true,  
Santa can you hear me?  
I want my baby, baby  
I want someone to love me, someone to hold  
Baby, baby, baby  
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year,  
All I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is here  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
  
I hope my letter reaches you in time, (oh yeah)  
Bring me love I can call all mine (oh yeah)  
'cause I have been so good this year, (oh oh)  
Can't be alone under the mistletoe,  
He's all I want in a big red bow.  
  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year  
And all I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is near  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here,  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
Ahh ahh ahh  
Oh santa, can you hear me...?  
Oh santa, well he's all I want  
Just for me, underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here,  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
Santa that's my only wish this year.
