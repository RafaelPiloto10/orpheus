Oh mother I want a dog  
I want a little dog  
I saw a little dog  
His name is happy  
  
Well this is me  
Don't get close to me now  
I could be a shopkeeper  
We'll call 'em  
  
She 'bout six foot four  
Now she's a wrecking-ball  
Back over here together  
She brought the bad weather with her  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Got me a pitchfork  
Oh step-ladders  
  
You oughta walk away  
Well you can't, but you oughta  
Climb the brick up to the stairs  
She got long black hair  
But don't sit there  
He let me keep the... chair  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Pitchfork (pitchfork)  
Crowbar (crowbar)  
Clawhammer (clawhammer)  
Hot tar (hot tar)  
  
She got me through her middle name  
But she can make it rain  
She's a small town jail  
And she's starving in the belly of the whale  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Pitchfork (pitchfork)  
Crowbar (crowbar)  
Clawhammer (clawhammer)  
Hot tar (hot tar)
