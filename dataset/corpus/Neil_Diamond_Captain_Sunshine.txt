Captain Sunshine, make me drink wine,  
Make me feel fine when I'm feelin' wrongly down.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.  
Captain Sunshine, he do me fine,  
Make the words rhyme when he knows the tune is sad.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.
