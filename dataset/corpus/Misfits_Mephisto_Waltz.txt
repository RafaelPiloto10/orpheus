Waltz, The pagan master  
Waltz, His evil shines  
Waltz, To the Devil's depot  
Waltz, It's gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz, Into the darkest feeling  
Waltz, Without a blink I go  
Waltz, To the Devil's ballet  
Waltz, To Mephisto  
  
Waltz, The Devil's dance  
Waltz, And in twilight gray  
Waltz, Darkness grows much faster  
Waltz, It's gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz, The pagan master  
Waltz, His evil shines  
Waltz, To the Devil's depot  
Waltz, It's gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Oh  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Oh  
  
Go, Go, Go  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz  
Waltz  
Waltz  
Waltz
