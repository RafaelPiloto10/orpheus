Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah  
Let's light the menorah  
Let's have a party  
We'll all dance the hora  
Gather 'round the table, we'll give you a treat  
A dreidal to play with and latkes to eat  
  
And while we are playing  
The candles are burning low  
One for each night, they shed a sweet light  
To remind us of days long ago  
One for each night, they shed a sweet light  
To remind us of days long ago
