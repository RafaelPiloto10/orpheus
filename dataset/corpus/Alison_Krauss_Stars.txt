Stood out in the rain  
Let it soak me down  
For I called you, I called you  
You did not see me there  
Hidden by the dark  
Beneath your window  
But I saw you  
  
When putting on a face  
For the mirror on the wall  
Dreaming that the looking glass is you  
Catching my fondest gazes  
Livin' through my fickeled phases  
I love you  
  
Spend my dimes on phones  
Trying just to talk  
But you don't answer  
You let it ring  
Spend my nights alone  
Catching falling stars  
To give to you love  
There just for you  
  
Stars fall ev'ry time  
A lover has to face the truth  
And far to many stars have fell on me  
And as they trail the skies  
I burn there paths upon my eyes  
I cry  
  
And it's getting easier  
Each day to weep about you  
Harder ev'ry night to sleep  
Without you  
  
How many years must I be  
Driven by this dream of love  
With you
