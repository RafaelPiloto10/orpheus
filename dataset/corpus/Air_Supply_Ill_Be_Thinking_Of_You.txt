When the sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
All those days of endless waiting  
I'll be thinking of you  
  
When thunder breaks the dawn  
When all muy strength is gone  
When shadows disappear  
I'll still be holding on  
  
When then sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
  
I'll be thinking of you
