A woman needs attention like the flowers need the sun  
'Cause without that attention Lord a woman feels undone  
And Lord I'm like a flower that's been standing in the rain  
Hoping Lord and praying that the sun will shine again  
  
Is there anybody out there who can shine  
Any time would be fine  
Is there anybody out there who can glow  
And would like to see a little flower grow  
Shine on me, let it shine  
  
A woman needs a love light to keep her body warm  
'Cause Lord without that love light  
Well her mind can do her harm  
And Lord that light's gone out for me  
I'm standing in the dark hoping Lord  
And praying just to see a little start  
  
Is there anybody out there who can shine  
Any time would be fine  
Is there anybody out there who can glow  
And would like to see this woman's love light show  
Shine on me, let it shine
