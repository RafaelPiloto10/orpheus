By Carole Bayer and George Fischoff  
I wanted you from the first day I saw you,  
The first day I looked into your eyes.  
That's when I knew that I would adore you.  
It was no surprise.  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I.  
  
You took my hand. Was then you had known it?  
Was that when you started loving me?  
Was it the way I smiled that had shown it?  
Was that the day you could see?  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I.  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I.
