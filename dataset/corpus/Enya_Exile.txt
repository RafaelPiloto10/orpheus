Cold as the northern winds  
In December mornings,  
Cold is the cry that rings  
From this far distant shore.  
Winter has come too late  
Too close beside me.  
How can I chase away  
All these fears deep inside?  
  
I'll wait the signs to come.  
I'll find a way  
I will wait the time to come.  
I'll find a way home.  
My light shall be the moon  
And my path - the ocean.  
My guide the morning star  
As I sail home to you.  
  
I'll wait the signs to come.  
I'll find a way  
I will wait the time to come.  
I'll find a way home.  
My light shall be the moon  
And my path - the ocean.  
My guide the morning star  
As I sail home to you.  
  
Who then can warm my soul?  
Who can quell my passion?  
Out of these dreams - a boat  
I will sail home to you.
