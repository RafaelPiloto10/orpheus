Have you ever been down to Haiti, when  
The summer sun was sinkin' low  
There's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glance  
And the native hearts are all a-glow  
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene  
They all stare like a statue out of stone  
And when they realize what's before their eyes  
The other girls are left all alone.  
  
Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'  
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm  
But from miles away you can see her sway  
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.  
  
Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky  
Sits a wide-eyed monkey on a limb  
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble  
Just to try to be like him  
He doesn't understand, that it's a lady's hand  
That makes a heart feel so sublime  
But before too long, he starts singing the song  
And then he gets in the Conga line.  
  
Columbus searched for spices, but he missed the nicest  
Part of the Caribbean  
He didn't see the charms and the open arms  
It was the gold that he was seein'  
Oh, but I'm glad he missed, the sweetest thing I've kissed  
'Cause we're on our honeymoon  
I'm so sorry Chris, to talk about you like this  
But you were five-hundred years too soon.
