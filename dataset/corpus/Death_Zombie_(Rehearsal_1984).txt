And I finally see the light again  
The light of my return  
After too much time in darkness  
I've had enough of being underground.  
By now it's all over  
Forgotten from memory  
And from the heart of the living.  
My sepulchre has become decrepit  
Decaying as my mortal remains  
They are corroded by time  
By vice and by worms.  
So many years now have passed  
From the last time  
That someone cried  
Or even prayed for me.  
Oooh zombie, what do you want from us?  
Oooh zombie, why have you come back to life?  
Men don't care about their dead  
Don't know that they come back  
Come back to kill them.  
Don't believe that it's all over  
At the moment of burial  
There is something more important  
That pushes us to come back.  
The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living  
That is the greatest day for me  
The day of resurrection.  
I don't know who I was  
I don't remember my ancient name  
But now I feel a new reason  
I have no fear to kill.  
Oooh zombie, what do you want from us?  
Oooh zombie, is this real life?
