I saw you in the picture  
I saw you play the part  
This ain't no disco  
There's a thousand watts in you  
You take this too far  
This ain't no disco  
  
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance  
This ain't no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby don't you let go  
This ain't no disco  
  
Part one  
Act one  
Everyone pretend  
This ain't no disco  
This is more a story  
And we're reaching the end  
This ain't no disco  
  
Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance  
This ain't no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby don't you let go  
This ain't no disco
