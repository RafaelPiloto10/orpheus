Somebody brought the juicer  
I thought I'd take a sip  
Came off the rails so crazy  
My senses took a dip  
Before the bottle hit the floor  
And I'd had time to think  
I was blinded by desire  
The elephant turned pink  
  
The rest is simply shady  
It's all been done before  
But it doesn't make life simple  
That's for sure  
You may think about a lady  
Cause yourself a minor war  
And your life won't be so easy anymore  
  
No sooner had I sown it  
When I began to reap  
I was torn from shallow water  
And plunged into the deep  
And as I started drowning  
I clung onto a straw  
That somehow kept me floating  
While my madness craved for more  
  
The rest is simply shady  
It's all been done and more  
But it doesn't make life easy  
That's for sure  
  
A pebble in the ocean  
Must cause some kind of stir  
And witnessed by the silence  
Will reach from here to there  
The action that I've started  
Sometime I'll have to face  
My influence in motion  
Rebounding back through space  
  
The rest is simply shady  
It's all been done before  
But it doesn't make life simple  
That's for sure  
You may think of Sexy Sadie  
Let her in through your front door  
And your life won't be so easy anymore
