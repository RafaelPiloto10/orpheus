I don't want to go and party,  
I don't want to shoot the pier,  
I don't want to take the doggie for a walk,  
I don't want to look at naked chicks and drink beer,  
I don't want to do a bong load, and go and wrench on the car,  
I don't want to hose the dog shit down,  
Cause I ain't even gonna get out of bed,  
  
I ain't gettin',  
I ain't gettin' out of bed today,  
I ain't gettin',  
I ain't gettin' out of bed today,  
  
Keep on skankin' Ronnie,  
Skank the night away,  
But the time is coming,  
For us all to pay.  
  
I don't want to watch no porno,  
And I don't want to play guitar,  
I don't want to spank the monkey,  
I don't want to go down to the corner bar,  
And I ain't even got to listen  
To all the stupid shit you got to say.  
I don't want to do a god damn thing.  
I don't want to,  
Want to leave my bed today  
I don't want  
Want to leave my bed today  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Keep on skankin' Ronnie,  
Skank the night away,  
But the time is coming,  
For us all to pay  
  
I don't want to eat burritos,  
Or read about OJ.  
No I don't want to get a head rush  
Cause I ain't even gettin' out of bed today  
I ain't got to leave my bed  
  
I ain't gettin',  
I ain't gettin' out of bed today,  
I ain't gettin',  
I ain't gettin' out of bed today,  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Keep on skankin' Ronnie,  
Skank the night away,  
But the time is coming,  
For us all to pay
