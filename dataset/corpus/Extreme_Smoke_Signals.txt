Keep your elbows off the table  
Look before you cross  
Buckle up your seat belt  
Parental discretion advised  
  
Keeping off the grass  
Beware of the dog  
A restricted area  
Police will take notice  
  
Oh, no, don't want to know  
My ass from my elbow  
Oh, no don't want to know  
Don't want to know  
  
Where there's smoke  
There's fire  
Don't be playin' ball in the street  
Where there's smoke  
There's fire  
What you sow is what you will reap  
  
Slippery when wet  
Skating on thin ice  
Caution falling rocks  
Give a hoot don't pollute  
  
Surgeon General's warning  
Don't you drink and drive  
Saying no to drugs  
Hazardous to your health  
  
Out of reach from children  
Fatal if you swallow  
Keep away from heat  
Pull in case of fire
