You know when I first started doing this album I thought  
All these songs about just gettin' the divorce  
And there was one thing I wanted to tell you darlin' darlin'  
Before the music stops for me and you and that's what you meant to me  
And even thought the divorce is final now  
I wanted to sing you this one last love song  
  
Your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For that's what love will do  
And darlin' (I'm so surprised) oh when I first realized  
That you weren't fooling me  
And darlin' they say that our love won't grow  
But I just want to tell them that they don't know  
For as long as you're in love with me our love will grow wider depper than any
sea  
And of all the things all the things that I want in this whole wide world  
Is just for you to say that you'll be my girl  
Oooh (wanting you) I'm wanting you (I'm so blue) oh that's what live will do  
  
I gave it a hundred and ten percent of my soul  
And I tried everything I could to hold it together  
But now that it's over I just wanted you to know  
That anytime you have sunshine you're gonna have bad weather  
Some people they can handle that and some people can't  
Just for the record another chapter in my life  
And you were that chapter just divorced  
Maybe they should write that on my tombstone darlin'  
Would that make you happy then  
Your precious love means more...
