How thoughtless  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
I talked to you as if  
I knew just everything  
Maybe I didn't lose  
But I know I didn't win  
How careless  
I had sometimes been  
I gave you the heartache  
But I felt the pain  
I wanted to tell you  
How much I love you so  
I know I'd been careless  
I forgot to let you know  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start  
How crazy  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
Next time I'll know better  
I'll have more time for you  
I'll listen to your heart  
Just like you asked me to  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
Forgive my many faults  
And the foolish things I've done  
I was so insensitive  
And I didn't understand  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start
