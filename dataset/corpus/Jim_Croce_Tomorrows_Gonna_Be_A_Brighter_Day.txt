Well, I'm sorry for the things that I told you  
But words only go so far  
And if I had my way  
I would reach into heaven  
And I'd pull down a star for a present  
And I'd make you a chain out of diamonds  
And pearls from a summer sea  
But all I can give you is a kiss in the morning  
And a sweet apology  
  
Well, I know that it hasn't been easy  
And I haven't always been around  
To say the right words  
Or to hold you in the mornin'  
Or to help you when you're down  
I know I never showed you much of a good time  
But baby things are gonna change  
I'm gonna make up for all of the hurt I brought  
I'm gonna love away all your pain  
  
And tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day  
There's gonna be some changes  
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day  
This time you can believe me  
No more cryin' in your lonely room  
And no more empty nights  
'Cause tomorrow mornin' everything will turn out right  
  
Well, there's something that I've got to tell you  
Yes I've got something on my mind  
But words come hard  
When your lying in my arms  
And when I'm looking deep into your eyes  
But there's truth and consolation  
And what I'm trying to say  
Is that nobody ever had a rainbow baby  
Until he had the rain  
  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a brighter day  
Come on tomorrow  
Come on tomorrow  
It's gonna be a brighter day
