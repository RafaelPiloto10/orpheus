I must confess what you say is true  
I had a rendezvous with somebody new  
That's the only one I ever had  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Cheatin' shows and it never goes  
You got a reason to be mad I suppose  
But she only was a passin' fad  
Baby, don't you be mad  
  
Her kind's a dime a dozen  
And that's not the kind I want  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would wander into that restaurant?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Now, her kind's a dime a dozen  
I should've passed her by  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would come along and give us the eye?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Understand that you're quite upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad  
Now, don'cha go away mad
