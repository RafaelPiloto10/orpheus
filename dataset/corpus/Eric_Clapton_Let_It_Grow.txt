Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs  
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,  
And all the time I know,  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it grow  
  
Looking for a reason to check out of my mind,  
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,  
But there's nothing left to show,  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, so let it grow, let it grow  
  
Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do  
Only ask and you will get what you are needing,  
The rest is up to you  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it grow
