Father we've come to seek Your face  
Desperate we ask You show the way  
As we pour out our hearts  
Come and never be apart  
We will lift our voices to join the heaven's song  
  
Reign over us Lord now we pray  
Come and cleanse us with eternal grace  
As we lift up our hearts  
Come and never be apart  
We will lift out voices to worship You our king  
  
You are holy  
Holy  
Holy is the Lord  
  
Say the words that calmed the raging seas  
Say the words that always bring us peace  
As we open our hearts  
Come and never be apart  
We will lift our voices to worship You our king
