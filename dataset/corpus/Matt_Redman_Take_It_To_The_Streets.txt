I am not a stranger to mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I am not a stranger to grace  
I have seen it in Your face  
I am not a stranger to kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
And I breathe it every day  
How did I become Your miracle?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
I'm going to sing it 'til we meet  
Heaven is open  
Come on all the earth rejoice  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
Wake up the dead heart from its sleep  
Heaven is open  
Now's the time to raise our voice  
I will tell the world of this mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I will tell the world of this grace  
I have seen it at Your cross  
I will tell the world of this kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
Help me live it every day  
How did we become Your miracles?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world
