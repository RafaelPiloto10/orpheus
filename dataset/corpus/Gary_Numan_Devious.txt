I remember one girl  
Saw her again in a magazine  
Front cover, big star  
Showing things that I'd never seen  
Well maybe  
Can you feel it? Can you?  
I remember one girl  
Who'd believe she'd be so devious  
Bad decision, bad move  
She told the papers everything  
Well maybe  
Do you need it, do you?  
Do you want it, do you?  
Come and get it  
I remember one girl  
She'd only make friends in expensive cars  
Television, good wine  
Leather seats and a friend of mine  
Well maybe  
Something's coming  
Oh no
