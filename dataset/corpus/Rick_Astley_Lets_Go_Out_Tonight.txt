Look At Me  
Hanging On A Word, Every Little Word  
Look At You  
Staring Out The Window, For A Different Point Of View  
What Should We Do  
  
Nothings Changed  
Everything's The Same, Same Old Same  
Lie In Bed  
Staring At The Ceiling, Wish I Was Somewhere Else Instead  
Enough Said  
  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
  
I Have Found  
I Can't Stand The Silence, Can't You Make A Sound  
What Is Wrong  
I See Your Body Language, Telling Me You Think It's Over  
Before It's Over  
  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
I'll Do Anything At All  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
  
You Say We've Got To Get Away  
We've Outgrown This Town It's So Mundane  
But If You're Asking Me  
The Chance Is There But We're Never Gonna Leave  
Never Gonna Leave
