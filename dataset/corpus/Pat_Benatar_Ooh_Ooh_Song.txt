Just when we think we conquered it  
It seems we lose the fight again  
But there's just no stoppin' it  
It's like a bad dream that never ends  
It puts up walls between us  
That get harder, and harder, and harder, and harder, and harder  
To remove  
But we let it continue, like people in love always do  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
  
Lets not pretend that we're unique  
'Cause everybody's tasted loves illusion  
We try to hide the fact that we  
Got lost between the chaos and confusion  
And the love we feel  
Is gettin' deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper  
By the minute  
  
But we let it slip away  
'Cause we don't know a good thing while we're in it  
  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh
