When you feel like it you just do it you never move around it you walk  
Through it well you don't give a damn where it comes from 'cause  
Everybody gonna have to chew your junk well does it feel right? Mmm does  
It feel right? Well let's jump let's jump to a blazing beat when you  
Close your eyes and strap into your seat you got the throttle wide open  
I head your engines scream it's a terrifying scene do you know what I  
Mean well let's funk, let's funk in my car let's jump to the nearest  
Star 'cause you won't get far with all that trash when all you do is  
Thrash! Thrash! Thrash! Let's funk, let's funk in my car let's jump to  
The nearest star 'cause you won't get far with all that trash when all  
You do is thrash! Thrash! Thrash! Motivator is the name of the game and  
If you want to know you're the biggest pain! You pull the plug out when  
The chips are down you stand on my face and kick me when I'm down!
