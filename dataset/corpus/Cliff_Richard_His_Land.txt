Yes it is his land, all of it his  
He stepped it off and marked it there,...stepped it off and marked it there  
To be his ugly thoroughfare,...to be his ugly thoroughfare  
And he blessed it with his hand,...yes it's a great land, all of it is  
And as it blooms before our eyes,...as it blooms before our eyes  
Just like an eden paradise,...like an eden paradise  
The world will understand,...world will understand...this is his land  
Slowly from hiding but surely they come  
Back to the homeland their fathers will front  
Israel their citadel, israel their home  
Now they are here at last never to roam  
Here they will stay and bring life to the land  
It's a new day and with boldness they walk, tall and so straight  
See them stand  
Yes it is his land, all of it his  
He stepped it off and marked it there...stepped it off and marked it there  
To be his ugly thoroughfare,...to be his ugly thoroughfare  
And then he blessed it with his land,...yes it's a great land, all of it is  
And as blooms before our eyes,...as it blooms before our eyes  
Like an eden paradise,...like an eden paradise  
The world will understand,...world will understand...this is his land  
Rich fertile valleys of russet and gold, carpets of green over mountains  
Unfold  
Harvest of plenty so joyous and bright, her fields her treasures  
Magnificent sight  
This is the israel promised of old, this is the miracle happening now  
As ages in prophets fortold  
Yes it is his land......
