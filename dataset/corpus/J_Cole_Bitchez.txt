[Intro: J. Cole]  
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez  
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless  
  
This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)  
You know who this is dedicated to  
  
[Hook: J. Cole] (X2)  
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez  
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez  
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless  
Where did your bitchez go?  
  
[Verse 1: Bas]  
Damn, you niggas so bitchless  
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers  
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?  
Bitch, I don't care  
Damn, you niggas so bitchless  
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers  
Got a bitch like a diamond  
Bitch got her flaws  
See the switch when she walk  
Give the bitch an applause  
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want  
Fly to another continent if I want  
Ride through the projects if I want  
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't  
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high  
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie  
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool  
She be waking up in boats, monsoon that's true, nigga  
  
[Hook] (X2)  
  
[Verse 2: Omen]  
Yeah, TDK, TDK  
Shots to these niggas, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J  
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded  
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated  
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?  
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite  
I don't talk much, but I say a lot  
Then when I stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot  
When we sweating in the dark don't run  
Throw it back like you're inside the park, home run  
She a square but that ass rotund  
She let me cut so I'mma ride shogun  
Know you heard about the backstroke  
I can make your perm turn to and afro  
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches  
Nice girls, classy women  
I'm too official  
Clean view, nigga too official  
Call a nigga dawg, I'm calling her a bird  
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle  
  
[Hook] (X2)  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!  
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna  
Get into something like a virus  
Get lucky like I'm Irish  
Born broke I'mma die rich  
Steve Jobs of the projects  
Pete Rock with a South twist  
When the beat drop nigga drop heat  
Like a teapot  
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge  
Once again it's on  
A nigga cash never been this long  
A nigga passion ain't been this strong  
I'm in the zone  
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long  
Open wide get my bid'ness on  
Young Dennis get my menace on  
No O-Dog more like more Caine  
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing  
'06 I was po' like rain  
Flow sick and I don't like lames  
Stop playing, bitch  
  
[Hook] (X2)
