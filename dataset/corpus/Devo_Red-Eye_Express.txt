Let me tell you a story  
Let me shovel some dirt  
Long time, no sugar  
And it s starting to hurt  
  
Something's flattened my cola  
Something's wrong with my brew  
Something's rotten in Idaho  
And I don't know what to do  
  
Gone, gone, gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
On the Red Eye Express  
Gonna, gone, gone  
On the Red Eye Express  
  
Only go around once  
Gotta quench that thirst  
Gotta grab that gusto  
Gotta get there first  
  
Red Eye Express  
Red Eye Express
