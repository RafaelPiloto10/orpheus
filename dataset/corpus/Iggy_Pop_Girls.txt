I love girls  
There all over this world  
Hah!  
Like to look at ya  
  
Well I'm gonna tell you about girls.  
They're all over this world  
Some have beautiful shapes  
I want to live to be ninety-eight  
  
Yeah, somebody to talk to  
And I like to look at you  
Yeah, somebody to talk to  
And I love to look at you  
  
'Cause you're a real fine girl  
Last week in Paree  
I was hanging down with Suzee  
That crazy French magazine  
  
She turned me backwards to a new scene  
'Cause she was somebody to talk to  
And to tell my troubles to  
She was somebody that's so fine  
  
Worth my looking in to  
She's a beautiful girl, girl, girl  
Summertime  
Oh, and the living is easy  
  
The girls are jumping  
And the cotton is high  
Your daddy is rich  
And your mama's good looking  
  
So hush little baby  
And don't you cry  
'Cause you're a real fine girl
