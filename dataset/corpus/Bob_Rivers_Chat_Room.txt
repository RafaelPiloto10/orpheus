(Convoy - CW McCall)  
  
('Well, hello, Mickey17 here.')  
('I'm uh, 17 years old.')  
('Yeah, tall, blonde hair, blue eyes. People tell me I look like one of the
Backstreet Boys.')  
('Which one? Uh, Huey or maybe Dewey'.)  
('I'd like to meet you too. What are you doing in 8 to 10 years?')  
  
It was dark in my room  
Like an ancient tomb  
'cept the monitor burnin' bright  
I was tryin' to meet girls on the internet  
But I hadn't had a doggone bite  
  
I was looking for love at 56K  
Typin' smut from town to town  
Said 'I'm a twenty-two year old college coed  
And I'm about to pull my panties down.'  
  
'Cuz were in a little chat room  
Typing through the night  
My left hands' on my mouse and  
I'm tickling the keys with my right  
Come on and join our chat room  
Who you wanna to be today?  
Thoughts go around this chat room  
Anything's okay  
  
Chat room  
Chat room  
  
('Well! What a coincidence. I am a lesbian too.')  
  
By the time the sun was comin' up  
I'd met girls from all 50 states  
Typin' 40 words a minute with just one hand  
So the other could co-allate  
  
Yeah, them keys was humming  
Like a Whitehouse intern  
Toying with a chick in Belair  
But the truth made me sick  
She sent me a pic  
And it had a lot of mustache hair  
  
'Cuz we're in a great big chat room  
Typing through the night  
Got me a chat room pen pal  
Hope she's a beautiful sight  
Come on and join our chat room  
Who you gonna meet today  
Try your luck in the chat room  
Across the cyberspace  
  
Chat Room  
Chat Room  
Chat Room'  
  
('I received your jpeg. Please resend. The photo appears to have smudged. It
looks like you have a mustache'Hahaha LOL.')  
('Perhaps we could meet in a more private room?')  
('Back door?')  
('Chip, is that you? You get your ass to bed before I come up there and
disconnect your mo-dem!')
