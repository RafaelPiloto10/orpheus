There's trouble on the subway, there's something on the track  
There's a dead end waiting and we can't go back  
So take it to the highway, head back and open wide  
Step right up and take a nowhere ride  
  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere job and I'm fired  
It don't matter what they say  
You can't get there going this way  
From L.A. to Miami and all points in between  
Look outside you get the same old scene  
You take it to the highway  
You travel far and wide  
Caterpillars carving up the country side  
  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere job and I'm fired  
It don't matter what they say  
You can't get there going this way  
  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired
