(Hang up the phone before I cry  
Hang up the phone before I die.)  
  
Well I just called you up to say hello (hello)  
And to say that I still love you so  
Then heard a voice and asked who's there with you  
Heard you answer just my brother Louie.  
  
Well, hang up the phone before I cry  
Oh, hang up the phone before I die  
For our love can never ever be  
And by the way your brother's here with me.  
  
There's nothing you can do to ease the pain  
Let's both forget and try to start again  
Go tell the guy that's takin' you from me  
That he can have you now I set you free.  
  
Well, hang up the phone before I cry  
Oh, hang up the phone before I die  
For our love can never ever be  
And by the way your brother's here with me.  
  
Hang up the phone, hang up the phone.  
Hang up the phone, hang up the phone.  
Hang up the phone, hang up the phone...
