Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear  
And he shows them pearly white  
Just a jack knife has Mac Heath, dear  
And he keeps it out of sight  
  
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear  
Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves though wears Mac Heath, dear  
So there's not a trace of red  
  
On the sidewalk, Sunday morning  
Lies a body oozing life  
Someone's sneaking round the corner  
Is the someone Mack the knife?  
  
From a tug boat by the river  
A cement bag's dropping down  
The cement's just for the weight, dear  
Bet you Mack is back in town  
  
Louie Miller disappeared, dear  
After drawing out his cash  
And Mac Heath spends like a sailor  
Did our boy do something rash?  
  
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver  
Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown  
Oh the line forms on the right, dear  
Now that Mack is back in town
