Don't you know we got smart bombs  
It's a good thing that our bombs are clever  
Don't you know that the smart bombs are so clever  
They only kill bad people now  
Don't you know though our kids are dumb  
We got smart bombs, what a joyous thing now  
Here we go so let's drink a toast  
To those clever bombs, and the men who built them  
  
There they go now, there go all my friends  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly, with their heads in the clouds  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Don't you know this is better than any video friend  
It's an action movie  
Here we go watch the bad guys get their butts kicked  
Really makes me feel good  
Here we go watching CNN, the adrenaline rushes through my veins now  
Don't you know it's a feel-good show, electronic bliss  
It's a video, video  
  
There they go now, there go all my friends  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
With their bright flags waving in the wind  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly, with their heads in the clouds  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Aren't you glad we got smart bombs  
It's a good thing that our bombs are clever  
It's a shame that our kids are dumb  
But our bombs are smart, what a lucky thing now  
Don't you know it's a feel-good show and it's suitable  
For the whole darn family  
Come on out everybody shout  
Give a big salute to our ingenuity  
Don't you know this is better than any video friend  
It's an action movie  
Here we go watch the bad guys get their butts kicked  
Really makes me feel good  
Don't you know it's Nintendo  
Really gets the blood flowing through my veins now  
Don't you know it's a feel-good show, electronic bliss  
It's a video, video  
  
There they go now, there go all my friends  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
With their bright flags waving in the wind  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly  
  
There they go now, there go all my friends  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
With their bright flags waving in the wind  
There they go now, marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly, with their heads in the clouds  
See them smile now, marching on in line
