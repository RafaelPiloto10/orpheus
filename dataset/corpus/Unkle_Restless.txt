Well I'm all restless but I don't care  
You don't like me much, well me neither  
You go me, my, ma, like you're some kind of God  
You live like someone trippin' on the same one you lost  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
  
Got this sinking feeling, so if I sing it it's true  
There ain't no habit that I will not defend  
If it comes back well I will not resend  
I'm broken, house broken  
Now you on the mend  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
  
Those who pay, will just pay it again  
Never beginning nor a jewel at the end  
Rip me from the breakage and solvents  
Taking over, I'll just take what you got  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
You're the truth, I do believe  
I'm in you, you're on me  
Easy  
  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow, gonna follow, gonna follow the light to the love  
  
Well I've gone restless, I don't care  
I got fifteen bucks worth of savior faire  
You wanna step in my way you won't step again  
I just break it, I just bend, I resend  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
  
Gonna follow the light to the love  
Gonna follow the light to the love
