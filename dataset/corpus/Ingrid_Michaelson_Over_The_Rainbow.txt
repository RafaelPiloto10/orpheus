Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high,  
There's a land that I've heard of  
Once in a lullaby.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
The bluebirds fly so high  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why can't I  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
The Bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why can't I  
Why then oh why can't I
