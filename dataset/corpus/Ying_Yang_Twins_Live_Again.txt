[Intro: D-Roc]  
I know what you go through  
From me to you, I love you  
  
[Verse 1: D-Roc]  
From the nigga to the baller, never satisfied  
So the money got you doing shit that'll fuck up your pride  
You ain't a hoe, you just really trying to get by  
Every day looking up at the sky  
Sometimes, shit get so hard  
It really have you bothered  
First you sigh, then you cry  
Up a whole puddle of water  
Seem like this shit won't ever end  
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds  
Waves turn to a hurricane  
If you see joy, you got to see pain  
Shit in the world ain't gonna ever change  
Even when you die, it'll be the same  
Now you due to them circumstances  
Jars aren't counted so your forced to dance  
Hoping and praying for a second chance  
Just wanna put back on your pants  
Walk out the club and throw up your hands  
Tired of being disrespected by her man  
Think this shit ain't right for you  
Niggaz been yellin all night for you  
Got in your mind what's best for you  
Walk up to the club to tell them your through  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
She's stuck off in this little room  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Her life is in a little box  
She's wondering will it ever stop?  
The life of a stripper  
  
[Hook: Girl]  
I'm so sick and I'm so tired  
Of these clubs, I keep crying  
Every night, I wipe my eyes  
Cause these years pass me by  
I give up, I'm all in  
My whole life is full of sin  
This road is a dead end  
I wanna live again  
  
[D-Roc]  
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord  
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard  
Which is kinda left up to the teachers  
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers  
the preachers ain't fillin' up the bleachers  
It's the rappers  
Sad, ain't it  
  
[Verse 2: Kane]  
It was this girl named Star, pretty fine little woman  
Going to college, taking off her clothes for money  
She gotta pay the rent, she got a little girl  
Her baby daddy ain't shit, See what she dealin with?  
But she gotta hold on (hold on)  
Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)  
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime  
She like "fuck how she feel" living is real  
So she back in the club again  
Taking off her clothes again  
Going to school, going to work, getting tiring  
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat  
and these shoes on her feet  
She got a test next week so she stressed  
Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction  
Her parents died when she was eight years old  
And after that, she felt like she was all alone  
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well  
Keep going to school, take care of yourself  
Getting hard, going to school and work in the club  
And at the same time looking for love  
She can't keep skipping for an occupation  
In a minute, she'll be graduating  
Make her wanna throw up her hands  
Now she only wanna live again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Chorus]
