I just got your letter baby, too bad you can't come home  
I swear I'm going crazy, sitting here all alone  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
Whoops there goes a tear drop, a-rolling down my face  
And if you cry when you're alone it's surely no disgrace  
  
I ain't slept a wink since Sunday, I can't eat a thing all day  
And every day is just blue Monday since you've been away  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
Whoops there goes a tear drop, a rolling down my face  
And if you cry when you're alone it's surely no disgrace  
  
I gotta get myself together before I lose my mind  
I'm gonna catch-a the next train going, and leave my blues behind  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
I gotta get myself together before I lose my mind  
I'm gonna catch-a the next train going, and leave my blues behind  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues
