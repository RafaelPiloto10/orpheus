The smoothest of the smoothest and locest of the locest  
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together  
So kindly, and you can find on the coast with the most lambs  
High post, plain coast with a bunch thug niggas, drug dealers  
Project fools, C-Murder past them tools  
Shit I'm bout to make these motherfuckers get up  
I draw the line between yours and mine  
And make sure you don't get lit up  
Hit ha on the mother fickin set when dip  
Dogg pound motherfucking gangsta crew  
Split wigs for a living everydays thanksgiving  
Motherfucker fuck y'all rides, we slides we dipping  
Nigga the tanks, driven by the colonel Mr. Master P  
Lil Silkky, Mystikal, C and me and Fiend  
Nigga don't be tripping, you got my lil homie in the cut  
That Soulja Slim nigga , he known for dippin  
  
Whats up  
(Don't let go)  
If you love ta bang bang  
And the rap game is just like the dope game  
The minute you forget it, forget it you finished  
Them niggas know when you ain't with it  
That's when they get ignent  
  
(Don't let go)  
Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with this  
It seems its on, but its off, I keep missing this shit  
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye  
Looking dead at the chips, I blink, they dip  
(Don't let go)  
Like a twista like a twista get twisted with this  
It seems its on but its off I keep missing this shit  
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye  
Looking dead at the chips, I blink, they dip

Niggas had homies with heat on the street and he got killed  
How the fuck did that happen I thought y'all niggas was rapping
