'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the chance  
That I didn't have to know you  
And live in peace, in peace  
  
'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the plans that  
I didn't use to get you  
At home, with me, alone  
  
Oh yeah  
  
'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can recall the way  
That I used to be, before you  
And sleep at night, and dream  
'Cause if I laugh, baby if I laugh  
Just a little bit  
Oh yeah
