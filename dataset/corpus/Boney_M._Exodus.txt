Get on board our silver sun  
This is noah's arc  
In the year 2001  
Up in heaven's park.  
  
Exodus, we go to another world.  
Exodus, foundation a better world.  
  
Journey of discovery.  
From this world of ours.  
Flying to a new home in the stars.  
  
Exodus, into the future  
Another world, we fly away.  
Exodus, into the dawn of  
A better world, another day.  
  
Exodus, a new horizon  
Another world we've just begun  
Exodus, we face tomorrow  
A better world, another sun.  
  
Exodus, we go to another world.  
Exodus, foundation a better world.  
  
Sailing through the universe  
Near the speed of light  
Planet earth is blue and out of sight.  
  
Exodus, into the future  
Another world, we fly away.  
Exodus, into the dawn of  
A better world, another day.  
  
Exodus, a new horizon  
Another world we've just begun  
Exodus, we face tomorrow  
A better world, another sun.  
  
Get on board our silver sun  
This is noah's arc  
In the year 2001  
Up in heaven's park.  
  
Exodus  
Exodus  
Exodus  
Exodus  
  
Exodus, a new dimension  
Another world, we've just begun  
Exodus, we face tomorrow  
A better world, another sun.  
  
Exodus, we face tomorrow  
A better world, another sun.  
Exodus, a new horizon...  
  
3rd, unreleased verse:  
There'll be no technology  
On this new-found land  
Nature's peace without the touch of man
