There's no time to give at all  
I cause you grief and blow my hatred  
Further in your mind  
You reach, I run, you fall  
On skinned knees you crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
  
So you sit and think of love  
I wait, hate all the more, I fall  
On skinned knees I crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
  
Now there's time to give it all  
I put my fears behind again  
On skinned knees we'll crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering
