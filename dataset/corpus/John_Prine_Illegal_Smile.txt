When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad  
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had  
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won  
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized  
That I was havin' no fun  
  
[Chorus]  
But fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
  
Last time I checked my bankroll,  
It was gettin' thin  
Sometimes it seems like the bottom  
Is the only place I've been  
I Chased a rainbow down a one-way street dead end  
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls  
Tryin' to get away  
From all the ears inside my walls  
I dreamed the police heard  
Everything I thought... what then?  
Well I went to court  
And the judge's name was Hoffman  
  
Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
Well done, hot dog bun, my sister's a nun
