Louise  
Coming on strong' can't be too long  
Gotta get what my body needs  
It needs Louise  
Louise  
Gonna break my heart, gotta make a start  
Gotta get it together with Louise  
Ooh Louise  
Queen in blue jeans,  
Boppin' at the hop,  
Alive with the jive  
Rollin' with the rock  
Louise  
Baby gonna move like lightning  
Don't blink your eye  
The speed I'm gonna do is frightening  
Everybody move on over  
I'm electrified  
The speed's comin' through like a nova  
verse 1  
verse 2  
verse 3  
Sparks are gonna fly igniting  
Mr Dynamite I'm burnin' up the night  
To light ya  
Get ready for the big explosion  
Call in the reserves there's gonna be a chain reaction  
verse 1  
verse 2
