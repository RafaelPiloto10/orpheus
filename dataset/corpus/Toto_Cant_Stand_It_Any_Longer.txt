Standin' on thin ice  
Walkin' on a fine line  
Never seem to buy, enough for you  
If you're lookin' for a way out  
Then you're headed for the right place  
Givin' up is something I can't do  
  
Ooh you got sharp claws  
Always got your back up  
Venom in your eyes, and blood so blue  
Hangin' on a black tie  
Sippin' on a half shell  
Holdin' all the cards, and a joker too  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now you're driving me crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand it any longer  
When you pay the price for freedom  
It ain't wrong girl  
I can't stand it any longer  
  
Dancin' on hot coals  
Playin' with a live wire  
Sneakin' out the back door, you're so cool  
If you really want to move on  
Then there's nothing left to say  
Here's a ticket for the bus stop  
I'm no fool  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now you're driving me crazy  
  
[Chorus]
