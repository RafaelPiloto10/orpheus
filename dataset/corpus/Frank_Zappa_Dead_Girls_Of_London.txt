C'mon everybody and let's get together tonight  
Got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running 'round with the usual crew  
Ah, who cares?  
C'mon everybody  
Well, my baby's number one but I gotta dance with three or four  
The place is really shaking form the bare feet slapping on the floor  
When you hear the music you can't sit still  
Your brother won't rock but your sister will  
Whoo  
C'mon everybody  
My place is really rocking, so we gotta put a guard outside  
If my folks come home, I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running 'round with the usual crew  
Who cares?  
C'mon everybody
