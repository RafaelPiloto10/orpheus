All i get is mixed signals from you,  
But you never give me a simple clue!  
Im stuck in a well with tear drops falling,  
My guide out is your voice but i don't hear your calling!  
I always hear through the grape vine,  
That you you talk about me all the time.  
  
Chours  
  
Where do i turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm.  
I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm!  
But now she came in the picture,  
And ripped our future from my grasp,  
why can't you say, you want me back,  
So everything can be like our past....  
And love me again!
