Yea, Yung Joc listen

Move ya best move  
  
[Chorus]  
Flip flop candy drop mj's wit da socks  
Dope boy get fresh Chevy on my head rest how ya feel? I feel good  
Chrome exhaust with the leather in the wood  
Flip flop candy drop mj's wit da socks  
Dope boy get fresh Chevy on my head rest how ya feel? I feel good  
Custom bucket seats baby I knew you would  
  
Ridin' in ya Chevrolet drop top  
We can do a lot of things wit the top dropped  
I see ya flossin' like a boss babe  
Oh sugar make me wanna break you off babe  
  
Shawty what it is what's on ya mind?  
Ya miss me fresh out hit the button top recline  
I'm glowing on the pine down martin Luther king  
I'm looking like a dream cause the Chevy so clean  
Dem j's on gleam check my gangsta lean  
Gorillas in my trunk so you know just how I'm vean?  
Dem peanut butter guts so plush is wat I'm used ta hit the turbo booster  
The Mr. throw the deuce up  
Paint still drippin' like it's fresh up out the shower  
12 in the cut a couple shots of blunt power?  
I rep that fo' five flat lands eighty V  
I skate off in the woods southside shady P (shady p)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, yo pull up in the seven seven cutlass and I'm throwed  
Got the swivel seats good shift and flow  
Underneath the hood gotta fo'54  
Plus the brain blowed out so I can blow out my dro  
Chrome pipes roarin' like lion in the jungle  
Be careful not to stumble they know I got that work by the bundle  
Catch me wit a quarter piece  
Somethin' from the middle east  
Show em' the Decatur streets  
Laid back in these ostrich seats  
I'm in the hood makin' deals on the cell phone  
Peakin' at that ass crack bustin' out that lil' thong  
Fuck em good grippin wood is how I get my gangsta on  
Pussy nigga try I'ma put one in ya thinkin' dome  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'ma keep it simple don't I ride clean? (yea)  
White cutlass wit the beat down system  
All black Cadillac Perrellis on the tire flip flop candy paint the bitches
goin' wild  
My engine gotta hemmy hear me from a mile  
To when you see us comin' bets believe its goin' down  
Catch me in the city it don't matter what it cost  
I can still get it wit the top peeled off  
Like MJ hit mo' mj jacket  
Mj's on my feet just to match it  
P-I-m-p I'ma keep grindin'  
Y'all keep talking cause I'ma keep shinin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ridin' in ya Chevrolet drop top  
We can do a lot of things wit the top dropped  
I see ya flossin' like a boss babe  
Oh sugar make me wanna break you off babe
