I want to go  
To see your house,  
To see how you're living.  
Living without you.  
  
And if you care,  
I'm wanting you  
From such a distance.  
Living without you.  
  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
I'll be your bestest friend.  
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh.  
And I want you.  
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh.  
  
The things you wrote  
To cut me off  
When I was trying.  
Living without you.  
  
To get with you  
Would be your friend.  
Make me feel so bad.  
Living without you.  
  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
I'll be your bestest friend.  
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh.  
And I want you.  
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh.  
  
Yeah, sweet girl  
I need you.  
Oooh, I think it could be so good.  
  
[Solo]  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
I'll be your bestest friend.  
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh.  
And I want you.  
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh.  
  
Yeah, sweet girl  
I need you.  
Oooh, I think it could be so good.
