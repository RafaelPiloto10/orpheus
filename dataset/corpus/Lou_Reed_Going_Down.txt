When you're in a dream,  
And you think you've got your problems all nailed down.  
Pieces of the scheme  
Seem to rattle up and to rattle down.  
  
And when you start to fall,  
And those footsteps, they start to fade.  
  
Then you know you're going down.  
Yeah, you're falling all around.  
And you know you're going down  
For the last time.  
  
When you're in the air,  
And you're thinking you'll drift off into the rest.  
Your friends politely advise:  
Hey, look, you're pushing too hard,  
And perhaps you need a rest.  
  
And when you start to fall,  
And all those footsteps, they start to fade.  
  
Then you know you're going down.  
Yeah, you're crashing upside down.  
And you know you're going down  
For the last time.  
  
Time's not what it seems.  
It just seems longer, when you're lonely in this world.  
Everything, it seems,  
Would be brighter if your nights were spent with some girl  
  
Yeah, you're falling all around.  
Yeah, you're crashing upside down.  
Oh, oh, and you know you're going down  
For the last time.
