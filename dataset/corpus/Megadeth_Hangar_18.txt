Welcome to our fortress tall  
Take some time to show you around  
Impossible to break these walls  
For you see the steel is much too strong  
Computer banks to rule the world  
Instruments to sight the stars  
  
Possibly I've seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much  
  
Foreign life forms inventory  
Suspended state of cryogenics  
Selective amnesia's the story  
Believed foretold but who'd suspect  
The military Intelligence  
Two words combined that can't make sense  
  
Possibly I've seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much
