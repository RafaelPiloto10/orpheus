I would've slipped off my jeans  
And slipped on my heels  
If I knew that I would see you  
Yeah, this diamond ring, gets kinda loose  
Gotta watch myself around you  
Glad you finally said something  
Cause it's been weighin' on my mind  
And messin' with my life  
I wonder should I feel guilty  
But we've haven?t crossed that line  
  
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong  
Nothin' wrong as long as we keep it innocent  
I'm just tryin' to have some fun  
But baby you're drivin' me crazy  
I ain't tryin' to make you crazy  
For me it ain't much that fun  
If we ain't doin' nothin' wrong  
  
If you only knew  
What you do to me  
When you walk away  
If I had chance, gave you a taste  
Baby you'd be beggin' me to stay  
Yeah, sometimes I wonder what it'd feel like  
But I gotta good man, and I'm a damn good wife  
And I don't wanna feel guilty  
But it's getting awfully hard to believe  
  
I'd never ask you  
Would you leave the one you love  
I'd never tell you  
I want you so bad it hurts  
I like the way you make me feel  
Baby can we make it real  
If we don?t make it real  
Then we aint' doin' nothin' wrong
