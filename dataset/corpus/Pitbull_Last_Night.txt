All it takes is, some voli on the rocks  
Havana brown  
Next thing you know shes on top of the bar no clothes for sure  
Afrojack  
Shes telling me to slow down, I live a fast life  
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night  
  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun  
Roll over, telling everyone  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I wanna say oh my God that was so much fun  
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night  
  
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas  
What happens in Miami, never happened  
  
Never happened  
  
Last night we were off the chain  
You name it we did it, you loved it for sure  
I can't remember her name, but her ass that I remember for sure  
Convenient amnesia, remember the good, forget the bad  
Remember the present, forget the past  
She don't get down, then forget to ask her  
One life, two worlds  
English, Spanish, one night, two girls  
English, Spanish, shes telling to slow down  
I live a fast life  
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night  
  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun  
Roll over, telling everyone  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I wanna say oh my God that was so much fun  
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night  
  
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas  
What happens in Miami, never happened  
  
Never happened  
  
Different night different city  
Different girl but its all the same  
I party every night like my last  
Be careful buddy you may run into my past  
I don't got a conscience, and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense  
I came to get off to everything  
So alert all the bonds men  
One life, two worlds  
English, Spanish, one night, two girls  
English, Spanish, shes telling to slow down  
I live a fast life  
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night  
  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun  
Roll over, telling everyone  
I can't believe what we did last night  
I wanna say oh my God that was so much fun  
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night  
  
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas  
What happens in Miami, never happened  
  
Never happened
