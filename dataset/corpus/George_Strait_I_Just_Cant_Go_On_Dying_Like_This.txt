I'm driving in my car alone  
You called me on the telephone  
How many times will it take till I'm convinced  
That you're using me, I'm just a used-to-be?  
It's a lie, I know it's a lie  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Can I see you tonight?  
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to  
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?  
  
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer  
I'm just a fool I guess  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Here I am again, it's four AM  
I think I'll play that song again  
The one called "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"  
And I'll wonder where you are tonight  
I don't know, I just don't know  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Can I see you tonight?  
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to  
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?  
  
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer  
I'm just a fool I guess  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Lord knows I just can't go on dying like this
