Yeah .. Whoo!  
  
Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust  
'cause they be thinking there in love when their in lust  
But cliche breakin' up so easy  
I'm about to throw a curve ball honey  
People let the stormy weather push them out  
Back against the road it's easy to be over  
  
Don't Sweat the little things wake up  
Stay together  
It's a new break up  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust  
And seems like everyone's giving up when  
These days breaking up is so cliche  
Hear 'em screaming out, "Baby no please stay"  
People wanna always hurry up and wait for  
Somebody better than the person they won't stay for  
They Sweat The Little Things Wake Up  
Stay together  
It's the new breakup  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
(Hey, yeah...)  
  
And though there will be the nights of fights  
We must face it  
It's like a rollercoaster  
Ups and downs will come  
As long as we hold tight  
And never act complacent  
Remember how we built this  
Then our love is never done  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
(Hey, uh!)
