You're a flamingo  
You stand on one leg  
You're a flamingo baby  
You hatched from an egg  
  
Well you hold your foot up  
So delicately over the sea  
And when it comes down  
It comes down on me  
  
Well it used to want to hump you  
I used to want to rock and roll  
I was attracted to your gracefulness  
But your surprise sure took its toll  
  
Now I guess I'd better go out now  
Gonna try to find something new  
And all I'm left with is this craving  
For some flamingo stew  
  
Now the beauty's in the gutter  
The loveliness is off her throne  
In the eyes of the beholder it's gone  
And now he feels kind of alone  
  
But this feeling it's the kind that will shortly pass  
I'm gonna find myself another bird  
And roll on down the grass
