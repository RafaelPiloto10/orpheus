Mexicali Rose stop crying  
I'll come back to you some sunny day  
Every night you'll know that I'll be pining  
Every hour a year while I'm away  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please don't sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose, goodbye  
  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please don't sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose, goodbye
