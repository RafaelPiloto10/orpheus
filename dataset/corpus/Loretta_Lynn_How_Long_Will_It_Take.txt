(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
Well you keep a telling me your love I'm winning  
Then you turn right around and you treat me hard and cold  
Well I ain't got but one life here I'm living  
So if you're gonna love me baby I've gotta know  
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you want me  
How much longer has this old heart gotta break  
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
  
Now there ain't a thing on earth that don't need a loving  
And baby I'm no exception to the rule  
But if you keep a putting everything above me  
Well how in this world will I ever get through to you  
(How long will it take)
