I'd just as soon try and count  
The stars up in the sky  
And look for all the raindrops in  
The river rolling by  
Stand a better chance to know  
How many granders sail  
Than to measure the love there is  
Between His outstretched hands  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
(On and on)  
Every passing hour shows  
The time is running out  
The voice of Heaven is calling out  
To a heart that's losing ground  
Though the pain in this world we know  
Is coming to an end  
(The face of God) In the face of God, we see  
An eternity begin  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
God's love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
(On and on) Hey  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh, God's love  
Forever on and on  
God's love  
Forever on and on (ooh)  
Oh, God's love  
Forever on and on (forever on and on)  
His love is forever and ever on and on  
Never ending, never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending, never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending, never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending (It's never ending)  
Never failing (It's never failing)  
Always loving (It's always loving)  
On and on (Forever)  
Never ending (It's never ending)  
Never failing (It's never failing)  
Always loving (It's always loving)  
On and on (Forever)  
Never ending, never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending, never failing  
Always loving on and on
