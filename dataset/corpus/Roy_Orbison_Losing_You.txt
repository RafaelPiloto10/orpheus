Teardrops tell me that I'm losing you  
Lost and lonely and I'm losing you  
Dreams remind me that I'm losing you  
Heartaches find me and I'm losing you  
  
If you could forget that love affair  
I wonder  
If you could how much would you still care  
  
It's no use now for I'm losing you  
No excuse now yes I'm losing you  
I love you much more than yesterday  
In sorrow  
I love you less than tomorrow  
I love you with all my love today  
But I guess I threw your love away  
I'm losing you  
What can I do?  
I don't want to but I'm losing you
