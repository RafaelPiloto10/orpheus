Hello honey, I just missed the train  
My watch must have stopped I guess  
Dinner is cold and the kids are asleep  
I didn't mean to get you out of bed.  
  
Always late (always late)  
Yes, it's always the same  
Procrastination is my middle name  
But the rest of the world is ahead of the game  
And that's why I'm always late.  
  
Won't somebody give me a ride  
I've been out of gas for hours  
My mother-in-law's flying in from the coast  
She's probably in an ambulance by now.  
  
Willie, it's time to get up  
Willie, you get out of that bed,  
You'll be late for work again  
Willie, Willie!  
  
Come on honey, give me a chance  
I promise to mend my ways  
Let's go out for an anniversary dance  
You say our anniversary's yesterday?
