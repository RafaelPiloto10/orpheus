The days seem so familiar  
There's something about the evenings  
Even though they change every now and then  
(Kenny Chesney):  
Well I can be myself here  
I can free myself here  
I can't believe it's last night again  
I see things go down  
I hear the talk of the town  
Like an echo in my ear  
If you should look for me  
I'll be right here  
I can leave myself here  
Or I could use some help here  
I can't believe it's last night again  
(K.C.):  
It's a lonesome sound when this bar shuts down  
So I guess I'll have one more  
Nothin' out there I ain't seen before  
I can leave myself here  
I could use some help here  
I can't believe it's last night again  
I can't believe it's last night again  
I can't believe it's last night again
