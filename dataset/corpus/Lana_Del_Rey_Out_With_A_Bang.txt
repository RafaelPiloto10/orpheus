Little bits and pieces, falling through the corners  
Box of broken lices, lined up in an order  
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way  
I'll tell you your future, you tell me your story  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
  
Smiles from the stranger, seem to change the day when  
You were just about to, go ant throw your towel in  
Lately I've been thinking bout making changes  
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
  
... like the sunshine, set on...  
Happy like a twister over akaluma  
Clear as penny mason lying in a coma  
This is our feeling, all my hurt is over  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
I'm going out with a bang  
  
Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me  
Tell me that it's over now that you have found me  
Walk me to the river, see the willow...  
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning  
We're going out with a bang  
We're going out with a bang  
We're going out with a bang  
We're gonna go home again  
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta  
Ta ta ta ta da da ra ra
