Won't you come into the living room  
We can talk about  
The way that we see this  
You can snuggle in my easy chair  
And I can tell you about  
The man that I really am  
We can talk about the family  
Or we can talk about the things  
That you've been missin'  
What's missing  
If you want someone who's listening  
I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man, a-ha  
  
Do you want to see a photograph  
It's a picture of the two of us together  
Got to be my favorite photograph  
From a time I know  
I'll always remember  
Now we got a little family  
Can't you see that I'm a man who's  
Just discovered what love is  
And one thing leads to another  
But I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man a-ha  
  
Can't you come into the living room  
Got a few important things  
I want to talk about  
Won't you meet me in the living room  
Stay around until there's not a single doubt  
That I love you, yes I love you  
When you need someone who loves you  
I'm you man, a-ha  
I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man
