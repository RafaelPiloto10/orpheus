I can't tell ya' how to run your life,  
To get along with one another.  
Everybody knows what's wrong and what's right,  
But, you can't trust your own brother, yeah.  
  
Everybody wants to be your friend,  
All the chicks, they call you honey.  
But don't trust them 'till the very end,  
'cause all they're after is your money.  
  
All they want is all your money.  
All they're after is your money.  
... is your money.  
All they want is,  
All your money.  
All they want is ...  
  
Don't it scare ya',  
When they take such good care of ya',  
And all you've got is money?  
Before they fool ya',  
Please, let me school ya',  
All you've got is money.  
  
(various screams)
