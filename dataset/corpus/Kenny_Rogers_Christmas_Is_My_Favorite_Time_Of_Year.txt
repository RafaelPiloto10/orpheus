How wise the wisemen must have been  
To find the Child in Bethlehem  
He lives again and draws us nearer  
Christmas time is here.  
  
A tail of love that never dies  
The laughter in the children's eyes  
The child in me is always there  
Christmas is my favorite time of year.  
  
The mist of wonder lies under my tree  
The gift of memories os waiting for me  
  
The day will come and soon depart  
The spirit stays to hear my heart  
With love for people everywhere  
Christmas is my favourite time of the year.  
  
Christmas is my favourite time of the year.
