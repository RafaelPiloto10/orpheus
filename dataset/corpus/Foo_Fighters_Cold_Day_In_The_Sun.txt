Take a high dive in to your brain  
Made your only cause  
Just might wear your welcome out if you don't' let It go  
  
There's nothing that you couldn't say Cauze you Said it all before  
Think it's time you walked this lonely road all on Your own  
  
So it's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
  
I could take it away  
Save you from yourself  
You get so lost inside your head like no one else  
Looking for someone to blame  
Blame me all along  
You take the heat but you would never take the Fall  
  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
  
You're so afraid that you are the only one  
But you are the only one you know  
Don't be afraid 'cause you're not the only one  
You're not the only one I know  
  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
