Sweet little girls  
Cut a swathe through this world  
Using skills that they get  
From their mothers  
Sweet little girls  
Might like ribbons and curls  
But they most like to torture their brothers  
  
And sweet little girls  
Love their friends  
'Till it hurts  
Or until they can find them another  
  
Watch their lips, they make a circle like  
"Coo coo coo coo"  
But the words their saying softly are  
Cruel cruel cruel
