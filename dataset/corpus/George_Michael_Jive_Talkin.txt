It's just your jive talkin' telling me lies  
Jive talkin' you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeh  
Jive talkin' you're really no good  
Oh my child, you'll never know  
Just what you mean to me  
Oh my child you got so much  
You gonna take away my energy  
With all your jive talkin' you telling me lies, yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
It's just your jive talkin', that's gets in the way, oh no  
Ta bee rup...  
Oh my love you're so good  
Treating me so cruel  
There you go with your fancy lies  
Leaving me looking like a dumb struck fool  
With all your jive talkin', you telling me lies, yeh  
Jive talkin' you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeh  
Jive talkin' you just ain't no good  
You know love talkin' is all very fine, yeh  
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime  
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die  
Then all that jive talkin' just gets in your eye...  
Jive talkin' telling me lies yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
It's just your jive talkin', that gets in your way...
