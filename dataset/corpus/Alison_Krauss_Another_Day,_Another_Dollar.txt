Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
I'm just trying to make a living  
Working jobs that I enjoy  
But it ain't easy finding something  
For this lonesome-hearted boy  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
You know my life is like a highway  
Just too many roads to take  
You know I'll try to take the right one  
Just gets harder every day  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today, hey  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away
