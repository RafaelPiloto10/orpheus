Memories of you and me  
Tumble inside my head  
The way that we used to be  
Things that we said  
  
No one has ever made me believe so strong  
You left me to wonder  
How did our love go wrong  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
  
I lie awake at night  
Wait for the sun to shine  
I still feel you next to me  
Your lips on mine  
  
Without a warning  
You made our love a lie  
You said you were sorry  
But you never told me why  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
  
Maybe my love is in vain  
Maybe you're the hurting kind  
Can't take no more of this pain  
I've got to get you off my mind  
  
Tried to be what you wanted  
I gave you all I had  
You left me with nothing  
Nothing but a photograph  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around
