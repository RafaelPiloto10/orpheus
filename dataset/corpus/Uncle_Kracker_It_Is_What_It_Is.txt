Jimmy keeps a picture of Jamie in his Wallet  
But everybody knows that Jamie's in the closet  
Katey's in the corner got her Prozac gone  
She only likes to dance to the Kid Rock songs  
  
Shally slings drink till a half past two  
Always looking like she got something better to do  
And I'm sittin' here in all my glory  
Everybody got a Beer everybody got a Story  
  
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't  
It's life and it's love and it ain't gonna change  
It's a beautiful mess  
I don't wanna miss  
It sits in the spins and it is what it is  
It is what it is  
  
Randy got a good job drivin' a truck  
He got a Black Jack habit but he got no luck  
And Kim had a Kid she named Cincinnati  
Cause that's the last place that she saw his Daddy  
And I'm sittin' here in all my glory  
Everybody got a Beer everybody got a Story  
  
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't  
It's life and it's love and it ain't gonna change  
It's a beautiful mess  
I don't wanna miss  
It sits in the spins and it is what it is  
  
Dollar Bills disappear into the Juke Box  
From sweet Caroline to Love on the Rocks  
I'm sittin' here cause that's what I do  
Enough about me let's talk about you  
  
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't  
It's life and it's love and it ain't gonna change  
It's a beautiful mess  
I don't wanna miss  
It sits in the spins and it is  
  
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't  
It's life and it's love and it ain't gonna change  
It's a beautiful mess  
I don't wanna miss  
It sits in the spins and it is what it is  
It is what it is  
  
Oh yeah  
It is what it is  
  
Dollar Bills disappear into the Juke Box  
From sweet Caroline to Love on the Rocks  
It is what it is  
It is what it is  
  
And I'm sittin' here in all my glory  
Everybody got a Beer everybody got a Story  
It is what it is
