In the Shuffling madness of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser, headlong to his death  
Oh, it feels the [Incomprehensible] scraping  
Steam breaking on his brow  
And Charlie stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
He sees his children jumping off at stations one by one  
His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun  
Oh, he's crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down, no, no, no  
He hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner has got him by the balls  
Oh, he picks up Gideons Bible, open at page one  
I thank God, he stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down
