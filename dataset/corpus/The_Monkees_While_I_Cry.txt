They told me what you'd do  
If I ever stayed with you.  
They told me that you'd laugh  
While I cried.  
  
They told me what you'd say  
That you'd turn and walk away  
And find another place to play,  
While I cried.  
  
Now I think back on those times  
I didn't read between the lines.  
How all the things that you said  
Never seemed to match the things you did.  
  
Thoughts keep turning round in my mind  
Now I see reason and rhyme.  
Time spent with you has brought me something  
And I've lost nothing If you are that kind.  
  
They told me what you'd do  
If I ever stayed with you  
And sure enough,  
It all came true.
