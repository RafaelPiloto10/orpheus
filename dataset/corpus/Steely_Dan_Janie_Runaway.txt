It must have been my lucky Thursday  
Your dad went on that spree  
Before the crew could put out the fires  
You hopped a bus for NYC  
Down in Tampa the future looked desperate and dark  
Now you're the wonderwaif of Gramercy Park  
  
Who makes the morning fabulous  
Who says today's a fun day  
Why do I feel like sailing again  
Honey it's you Janie Runaway  
  
Let's grab some takeout from Dean and Deluca  
A hearty gulping wine  
You be the showgirl and I'll be Sinatra  
Way back in '59  
Sweetness in heels, look at you, in long black gloves  
Come to old blue eyes tell me, who do you love  
  
Who makes the traffic interesting  
Rescues a dreary Sunday  
Who makes me feel like painting again  
Honey it's you, Janie Runaway  
  
Let's plan a weekend alone together  
Drive out to Binky's place  
The sugar shack in Pennsylvania  
Or would that be a federal case?  
We'll take the Big Red, the Blazer, it's nice inside  
And guess who's coming along for the ride  
  
Who has a friend named Melanie  
Who's not afraid to try new things  
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain  
Possibly you, Janie Runaway
