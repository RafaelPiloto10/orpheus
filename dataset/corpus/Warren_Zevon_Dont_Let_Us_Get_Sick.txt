  
Don't let us get sick  
Don't let us get old  
Don't let us get stupid, all right?  
Just make us be brave  
And make us play nice  
And let us be together tonight  
The sky was on fire  
When I walked to the mill  
To take up the slack in the line  
I thought of my friends  
And the troubles they've had  
To keep me from thinking of mine  
Don't let us get sick  
Don't let us get old  
Don't let us get stupid, all right?  
Just make us be brave  
And make us play nice  
And let us be together tonight  
The moon has a face  
And it smiles on the lake  
And causes the ripples in Time  
I'm lucky to be here  
With someone I like  
Who maketh my spirit to shine  
Don't let us get sick  
Don't let us get old  
Don't let us get stupid, all right?  
Just make us be brave  
And make us play nice  
And let us be together tonight
