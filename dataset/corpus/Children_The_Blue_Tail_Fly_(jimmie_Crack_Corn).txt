When I was young I use' to wait  
On massa an' hand him his plate  
An' pass de bottle when he got dry  
An' brush away de blue-tail fly  
  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Ol' Massa's gone away  
  
One day he ride aroun' de farm  
De flies so num'rous they did swarm  
One chanced to bite him on de thigh  
De devil take de blue-tail fly!  
  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Ol' Massa's gone away  
  
De pony run, he jump he pitch  
He threw my Massa in de ditch  
He died an' de jury wondered why  
De verdict was de blue-tail fly  
  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Ol' Massa's gone away  
  
They lay him under a simmon tree  
His epitaph is there to see --  
"Beneath this stone I'm forced to lie --  
Victim of de blue-tail fly. "  
  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Jimmie crack corn an' I don't care  
Ol' Massa's gone away
