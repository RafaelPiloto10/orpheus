Jesus said to mary: lord the things we do for love  
Well do you think I seem selfconcious,  
Its only you I'm thinking of.  
I was hiding in the bathroom quite unable to cry.  
Now I'm weeping with a vengeance  
Since your voice came down the line.  
  
And I move up from the country,  
Oh I never could have stayed.  
I just dipped my hand in the water  
And got carried away.  
  
Oh would you put me down  
Just for being around  
At the wrong time all day  
Or would you leave while I'm sleeping  
Out through the fire escape  
They tell me swans do fly  
Across the perfect sky  
And it's the purest sky tonight  
So you desert me in the morning,  
Kind of your cruelty and spice  
And I move up from the country to wave a goodbye to old anne  
And I just let her on that riverboat and I never will look back  
  
Jesus said to mary: look at the things we do for love  
Well do you think he was selfconcious,  
It was only her he was thinking of.  
I was hiding in the bathroom quite unable to cry.  
Now I'm weeping with a vengeance  
These are tears of joy oh my  
  
And I move up from the country,  
Oh I never could have stayed.  
I just dipped my hand in the water  
And got carried away.
