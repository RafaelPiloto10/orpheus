Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
When first I heard rock steady  
Thrilled me to the bone  
When I talk about rocking steady  
You need a baby for your own  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
Talk about the cha-cha  
Talk about the mambo  
When I talk about rocking steady  
You better be ready  
To rock stead easy  
  
Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
When first I heard rock steady  
Thrilled me to the bone  
When I talk about rocking steady  
You need a baby for your own  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
Rock stead easy  
Steady rock easy  
You're doing good  
Rock stead easy  
Just like you should  
Steady rock easy  
You're looking fine
