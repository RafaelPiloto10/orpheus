You illuminate me  
You're the color I see  
You're all the shines above  
Through the dark and mistrust  
  
All the doubt in your eyes  
All the stars in the night  
Is it the distance you need  
Or is it just me?  
  
I know you're awake  
'Cause you shake when you cry  
As long as I wait,  
I've got nothing but time  
  
Take me in, or just take me out  
Put me on if you must, or just put me down  
'Cause I'm done, I'm all worn out  
We're either alive or a lie  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
  
You're the wind at my back  
You're the courage I lack  
But you live your life like a war  
What are you fighting for?  
  
Your touch is the water  
That gives and takes away  
So I wait in the gutter  
For another rainy day  
  
Take me in, or just take me out  
Put me on if you must, or just put me down  
'Cause I'm done, I'm all worn out  
We're either alive or a lie  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
  
You close your eyes to see the sun  
And all the things you've never done  
They all come out in the dark  
And once again just break your heart  
  
I know you're awake  
'Cause you shake when you cry  
I'll hold you, I'll hold you,  
But you've got to decide  
  
Take me in, or just take me out  
Put me on if you must, or just put me down  
'Cause I'm done, I'm all worn out  
We're either alive or a lie, oh  
We're either alive or a lie  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
Done with the middle ground.  
  
I'm done with the middle ground.  
I'm done with the middle ground.
