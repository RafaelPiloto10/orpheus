How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream  
When memory recalls them now and then  
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
If I could only hear my mother pray again if I could only hear her tender
voice as then  
How happy I would be with who means so much to me  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
[ ac.guitar ]  
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely and always walk the shining gospel
way  
So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above  
For I shall meet my mother some glad day  
If I could only hear my mother...
