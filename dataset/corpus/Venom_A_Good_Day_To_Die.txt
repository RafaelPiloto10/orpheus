Don't let it be said you'd be better off dead  
Words will get mixed up inside of your head  
When you're playing the game can't remember your name  
You know it's fucked up the same  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Fighting back - Come what may  
A good day to die - A cold grave to lie  
A good day to die  
The lies and the greed of the demon seed  
World of the ignorant trying to breed  
Never settled the score as I opened the door  
But you kept wanting more  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Kicking back - Come what may  
A good day to die  
Stand up and fight  
A cold grave to lie  
This secret lie  
Good day to die  
No time to cry  
You tried to fly  
Reach for the sky  
With your Russian roulette you'll take the bet  
Sleeping on coals that you'll live to regret  
In an orgy of death and your crimes and the tests  
Is this your final breath?  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Fighting back - Come what may
