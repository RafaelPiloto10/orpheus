My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But it's funny now and then  
How my thoughts go flashing back again  
To my old flame  
My old flame  
My new lovers all seem so tame  
For I haven't met a gent  
  
So innocent or elegant  
As my old flame  
  
I've met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame  
  
I've met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame
