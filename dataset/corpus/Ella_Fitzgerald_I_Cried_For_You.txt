I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has it's turning  
That's one thing you're learning  
  
I cried for you, what a fool I used to be  
But I found two eyes just a little bit bluer  
I found a heart just a little bit truer  
  
I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
  
I cried, how I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Oh, but I found two eyes  
Just a little bit, little bit bluer  
I found a heart just a little bit, little bit truer  
  
For I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
Over me, over me
