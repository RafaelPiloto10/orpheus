Why must I be so lonely?  
When so many people pass me by  
I've been waiting for oh so long now  
And yet I'm unable to answer why  
I can't be made to give up now  
Can you find room for me  
In your heart somehow?  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
  
I guess I'm a victim of loneliness  
But why should this be my destiny?  
A foolish man for a lot of my life  
Shouldn't there be someone  
Someone for me?  
I hope and I pray some happy day  
That I'll be around to hear you say  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved
