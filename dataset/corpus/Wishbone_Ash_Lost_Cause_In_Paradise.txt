They were fair and they were blond,  
Laughing loud and singing songs,  
Hoping for the best in life,  
Heading for a paradise.  
In the flash of an eye was born,  
What would grow to become a storm,  
When the fountain of youth was sprung,  
Lost and gone, everyone.  
In the man is the child alive,  
To know and feel how to survive,  
But the world was as cold as ice  
When they looked for paradise.  
Love in hand, the first to fight,  
The golden dawn was a nasty sight.  
The world turns as cold as ice,  
Lost cause in paradise.  
They were fair, and they were blond,  
Laughing loud and singing songs,  
Bit the world was as cold as ice,  
Lost cause in paradise.
