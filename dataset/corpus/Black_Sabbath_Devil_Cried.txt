The Devil Cried  
  
One fine day in Hell  
The master told a story  
Someone lied so well  
He sent him back to Glory  
  
There are whispers between the screams  
That this deed can be done  
Even sinners must dream  
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry  
  
I can win this game  
If all things come together  
I know this sounds quite strange  
I won't be smart, just clever  
  
It's the law on the other side  
Just the kill lets you run  
And how many have tried?  
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry  
  
At last my time has come  
I must not give him pleasure  
I can be the one  
One chance or burn forever  
  
So I told him about my pain  
And the life I've been through  
He just smiled and the laughter came  
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried  
  
Tears from his eyes  
Eyes of fire  
And the Devil cried
