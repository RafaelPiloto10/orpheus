It's really been a long time  
Since I let somebody hold me  
Since I felt safe in somebody's arms, em em  
You were a good friend I could confide in  
But after all the lies he told me  
I couldn't let nobody in my heart  
I was torn apart  
All this time you've been right here  
He's been doing nothing but wrong  
And though the best thing in my life was  
Here with me all along  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
You'd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
He kissed away my tears  
And now they've disappeared  
You make me feel safe in somebody's arms  
You're the kind that can do me no harm  
These questions everybody asks me  
They say they've never seen me so happy  
But that's a secret between you and me  
They don't know nothing about us baby  
Can't let up  
Can't tell anybody that you're not from around here  
They don't know that you're an angel  
But now it's all so clear  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
You'd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
Is this a dream  
Are you for real  
You got me honey  
Feeling things that I never thought I'd feel  
You taught me love  
Don't have to break my heart in two  
That's just one more of those things  
That I never, never knew  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me  
There was an angel  
I never, never knew (that my heart could fly)  
It's all because of you baby  
My life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never knew
