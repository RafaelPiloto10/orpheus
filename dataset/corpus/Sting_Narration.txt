One. Exterior.  
Cathedral. Daylight. Establishing it's beauty in elevation, stain  
Glass and stone carvings. From its huge doors suddenly comes a  
Flow of white cloud choir boys. Angelic, white surplussed, all  
Bobbing in a disciplined stream. But then, suddenly in their  
Midst, startling, ridiculous, incongruous is Martin a young man  
In an ill fitting rain coat. As the boys proceed in their orderly  
Way, Martin is left alone. Peculiar, disturbing. Which one...  
Which one will it be?  
  
Two. Interior. An office near the Cathedral. Daylight. A view of  
The Cathedral through the window. Alone, in this Dickensian  
Office above the small printing presses, sits Mr. Bates, middle  
Aged, meticulous, writing with a gold barreled fountain pen. He's  
Finishing a little verse beneath a picture of an angel:  
  
Although we all must sometimes stumble  
As we journey through this life,  
I've never heard you moan or grumble,  
The perfect mother and wife.  
Bates places the sheet of paper on top of a pile of similar  
Sheets, his face heavy with contempt. He stares into the middle  
Distance. A framed photograph of a lively, attractive young  
Woman, Patty, his daughter, is in front of him, on his expanse of  
Desk. He glances at it. He caps his fountain pen, neatly puts the  
Sheet into the pending tray, neatly lines up his blotter, his  
Desk aids, and satisfied, rises to join the homeward throng.  
  
Three. Exterior. Cathedral precincts. Fading daylight. A few  
People bobbing along with the anomalous, near vacant, tired  
Expression of home-goers. Which one... which one will it be?
