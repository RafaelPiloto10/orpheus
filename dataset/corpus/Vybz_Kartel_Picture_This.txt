Timeless, (time)  
See mi are say up to di time  
Still yuh nah know baby  
I just got to say close yuh eyes  
And imagine that, you are with me  
On a long island of paradise  
And I just close my eyes to  
And imagine that I'm somewhere with you  
On the U.S Virgin Islands, (Right Away)  
Baby, baby, aye  
  
Picture me and you, you and me  
K-I-S-S-I-N-G, then  
Picture me and you, under the tree  
F-U-C-K-I-N-G, Aye  
All mun fi bow, dem wicky di, nor  
S-U-C-K-I-N-G, gal  
You are mi Q-U-E-E-N, so mi  
I your K-I-N-G  
  
Di first time buddy go inna her  
Mi wake up to, good morning sir  
Here is your breakfast what you prefer  
Me say stop! Baby remain as you were  
Me nah eat in a bed that no occur  
Because mi nah gummy bear, nah Christopher  
But mi like it weh you shake it right deh  
So turn it back-way let mi get fi enter di center  
  
Picture me and you, you and me  
K-I-S-S-I-N-G, then  
Picture me and you, under the tree  
F-U-C-K-I-N-G, Aye  
All mun fi bow, dem wicky di, nor  
S-U-C-K-I-N-G, gal  
You are mi Q-U-E-E-N, so mi  
I your K-I-N-G  
  
Print it, let mi sink it  
If you pretty like Ashanti  
Mi murder inc. it, pussy print it  
Mi nah nyam Shirley biscuit  
Which butter kiss, never will, never kiss it  
Under house arrest modeless and frisk it  
This kick, hurt up your belly like Nesquick  
Mi nah chocolate, badman tongue no fork-lift  
You nor fi ask if God bless mi with a ras-lift  
Ha Ha
