You are so far (You are so far)  
Oh like the star (Oh like a star)  
Oh I feel inside, I miss you tonight  
Do anything to make your mine  
  
A lonely night (A lonely night)  
The stars shine bright (The stars shine bright)  
I have an idea to have you near  
Here just by my side  
  
Send me a little SMS to my heart  
Send me a little SMS like I do  
Oh baby, I will never tearing apart  
'Cause my heart is missing you  
  
Send me an S, send me an M  
Send me an SMS to my heart  
Send me an S, send me an M  
Send me an SMS and we try a start  
Hey little girl (Hey little girl)  
It's a lonely world (It's a lonely world)  
Hear my SOS, babe, I confess  
Cannot live without your love  
I'm lost in space (I'm lost in space)  
Want to see your face (Wanna see your face)  
Wherever you be, send some words to me  
Send a message to my heart
