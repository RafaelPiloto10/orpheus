Take stock of your life  
What's wrong and what's right  
Empty pockets, got no green  
Don't you know sunshine is free  
What breaks have you had  
Some good and some bad  
Want to go but got no car  
Dreaming dreams can take you far  
  
[Chorus]  
You will find that life's worth living  
In this world, it's out of this world  
With a little love and a little giving  
In this world, it's out of this world  
  
Look to the future  
Who's in the picture  
Say your love life's just a dream  
Still you've got a friend in me  
  
Today, tomorrow  
Laughter and sorrow  
Gonna be some lows and highs  
Might as well enjoy the ride  
  
[Chorus]
