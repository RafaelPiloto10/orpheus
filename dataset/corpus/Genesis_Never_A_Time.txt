There is never a time to say  
Cause it seems to me we've lost our way  
So we carry on, down the road  
And we live our lives haunted by  
All the things we say and do  
Keep on missing, when I'm alone with you  
  
No there's never a time to change  
You don't get a chance to rearrange  
It's a long, long way to go  
Just to find out something, we both know  
Can't you see what's going on  
It's so sad, that a love so strong, has gone  
  
All I know is what is true  
All I ask is for you to  
Just look around and see  
  
You live your life locked in a dream  
  
Where nothing is real, and not what it seems  
We can't go on another day  
Just being afraid to say  
  
It's a long long way to fall  
When we both thought we had it all  
Well you know it's the time to say  
Cause we're all played out, we've lost our way  
Oh, I'd hoped that you would  
Be oh so understanding  
And by now you'd see, but oh no  
So sad, so sad, that's the way that it goes  
I know, I'm gonna tell you right now
