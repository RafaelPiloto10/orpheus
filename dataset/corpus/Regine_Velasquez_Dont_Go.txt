You said, "I lied"  
You screamed, I cried  
You packed your things  
You wanna leave  
You get the car keys  
And headed for the door  
  
Chorus  
Now, I'm down on my knees  
I'm beggin' you please  
Don't go, don't go  
Don't give up on us now  
We can work it out  
Don't go, don't go  
  
Maybe I'm wrong and you're right  
I said "I'm sorry"  
No, I don't wanna fight  
Just calm down  
And hold me close  
And dry the tears in my eyes  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Bridge  
Why can't we kiss and make up  
I don't want to ever break up  
Why can't we forgive and forget  
And stay together  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
[Repeat chorus on the background]  
Don't go  
I'm down on my knees  
Oh, baby, I'm beggin' you please  
I'm beggin' you please  
Don't go  
Don't, don't go
