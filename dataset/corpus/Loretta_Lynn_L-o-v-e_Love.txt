L-o-v-e l-o-v-e love  
There couldn't be a bad word I haven't heard you say  
Don't you know the needs of any woman  
You speak words my ears have never heard of  
The only four letter word that you don't know is l-o-v-e love  
L-o-v-e a word you never use l-o-v-e your lips never choose  
It's enough to make a woman want to give of  
The only four letter word that you don't know is l-o-v-e love  
[ guitar ]  
It would tear me all to pieces if you ever came to me  
With more to give than one robbed kiss at nighttime  
You'll never know the longing that my heart does  
The only four letter word that you don't know is l-o-v-e love  
L-o-v-e a word you never use...
