Well, she said all along, I'm her one  
A little fingernail polish, chewin' gum  
Her round the world heart made of platinum, that's right  
She looks like a China doll baby, especially in white  
A tropicana flower in the candlelight  
She turned into a pumpkin pie, sweet kiss at midnight  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She wants to be your red-hot mama, all alone  
She dances with the boys on the telephone  
She makes a lotta noise in the quiet zone at night  
Yeah, you talk about a party at the beach, ain't that grand  
She just took a raincheck with another man  
Who lay on the deck of his catamaran some night  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
Well, I can't tell you much, but what I know (what I know)  
You can't take her with you when it's time to go  
'Cause she knows where it's at with a Romeo, you'll see  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She moves  
Just like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night
