Looking back over my life  
I can see some changes  
That You alone have brought  
Everything became so clear  
At the moment  
That You came in my life  
It was as if I'd seen for the first time  
And suddenly I felt like I could breathe  
What a perfect day  
What a perfect day  
What a perfect day when You came into my life
