Where am I  
Someone please turn on the lights  
I'm not fine I'm not fine  
How can I find my way from this little cellar they call life  
  
Down here I tear out my veins and tie them to the chair  
This goes on and on and on  
Unraveled in contortions I run for the door  
This goes on and on and on  
  
Hold on to my own destruction  
I fall face first  
Watch me descend I'm on display  
This cycle of human decay  
  
I feel it lurking in the corners  
I watch it tracking up my arm  
  
I am the anchor  
Bound to my existence  
  
I make peace with the parasites I live among  
Paralyzed I watch them colonize as I sit here and just fall apart  
  
The beggars and choosers are all the same  
The default reaction will never change  
So I catch a glimpse of my own reflection  
From a shard of glass left on the floor  
  
Its time to restart  
Reassemble what's left of my body  
Pick me up and walk away  
  
Uproot the anchor  
Walk right out the door  
  
I'll change for the better  
It can't get much worse  
I'll swallow my own pride  
And then accept defeat
