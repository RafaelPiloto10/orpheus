Out on my own  
In the suburbs of Moscow  
Out in the rain  
Walking down this long avenue  
  
Out to the crowds in the square  
Feelings are high everywhere  
  
But the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay  
  
Look at the girl  
Gazing through the window  
Clutching her books  
Memorizing every line  
  
Keep your belief at the start  
This was the faith in my heart  
  
But the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay  
  
Where can we go  
In the suburbs of Moscow  
Watching the rain  
Beating down empty streets  
  
Yes, the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay
