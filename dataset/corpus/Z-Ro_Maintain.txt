[Z-Ro]  
I'ma maintain, all about fortune, not the fame  
Feddy, cold cash and a diamond ring, it's all about feddy when I  
Rap sing  
I'm sick of this struggling all damn day  
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray  
This for the little kids that can't go play  
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK  
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost  
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed  
I be a fool with that break them off  
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off  
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain  
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain  
Tears be coming on down like rain  
It's a full time job, trying to maintain  
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with  
Dreams and hopes  
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from  
Songs I wrote  
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill  
My shoes  
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill  
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues  
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way  
  
But one of these days gone be out there  
It's a bitch took a ball, ball and parlay  
Until we make it we mash together  
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together  
South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever  
  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Maintaining, hustling struggling but I got to survive  
Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying  
Alive  
  
[Hawk]  
I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded  
Gun  
  
Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in  
Your lungs  
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor  
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro  
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep  
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet  
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete  
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat  
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain  
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine  
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family  
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T  
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em  
Spread  
Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed  
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull  
All that, I say, I speak, the truth  
  
(Chorus - 2x)  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never  
Did shine  
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I  
Got to get mine  
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay  
Broke  
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day  
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when  
She come home  
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month  
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome  
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck  
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick  
Give me a couple of zeros on a check  
I might sweat, but never gone let up  
  
(Chorus - 6x)
