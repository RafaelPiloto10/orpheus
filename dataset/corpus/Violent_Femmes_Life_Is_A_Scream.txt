She said to me oh I don't know what you mean  
All I'm trying to do is  
Trying to make your scene  
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem  
  
Well don't you know baby that life is a scream  
She came up to me in her high fashion and sheen  
Well don't you know that she was trying to come clean  
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem  
  
Well don't you know baby that life's a scream  
She said to me oh I love it when you're mean  
Don't you know it's boring when it's quiet and serene  
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem  
  
Got to get it through your head that life is a scream
