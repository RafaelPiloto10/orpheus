Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
  
Here's to, to a long forgotten dream  
Enshrouded by, by a history so clean  
In a place still the same, so rich with time  
I remain in my heart, my soul, my mind  
  
So clear is the mystery to me  
So majestic, yet electric, dose of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
Can't restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
To sing, to dance, to laugh  
  
Embrace  
So vague is this picture I am seeing  
Yet so clear, and so dear my soul is singin'  
To belong is this feelin' I am missin'  
  
To embrace this memory I been kissin'  
So clear is this mystery to me  
So majestic, yet electric, guest of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
  
Can't restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
  
To sing, to dance, to laugh  
Embrace  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin' take me back  
  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin' take me back
