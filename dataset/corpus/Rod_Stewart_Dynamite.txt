Oh, look out Bill!  
  
I got a stupid little job  
It's drivin' me insane  
With those keyhole people  
All they do is complain  
About the tattoo on my arm  
The ring in my ear  
But I don't even care, no no  
I just live through the week  
And when I see them boys  
You know their two-tone suits  
They're all unimportants  
If you need a set of hubcaps  
Or a car painted  
Girl, why don't you follow me  
  
It's dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, all right  
Yeah dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, all right  
  
Play some sweet guitar, yeah  
  
Well we meet on the corner  
And we talk all night  
About our wealth situation  
At a rock'n' Roll drive  
We go cruisin'  
So the conversation turns to wise girls  
And more pearls  
I got a beat up old Mustang  
And I painted it black  
There's five in the front seat  
And the rest in the back  
Cruise up and down Sunset  
And watch all the jailbait roll by  
  
Yeah it's dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, all right  
Yeah yeah, it's dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, it's all right  
All right, all right, all right  
All right  
  
Are you ready. Bring it down now  
Watch out. Well, well, well  
  
Listen, one of these days  
And it won't be long  
Gonna hear that radio  
Playin' my song  
I'll be the darling of masses  
No great pretender, not me, yeah yeah  
'Cause I can play this guitar  
Hangin' round my neck  
I'm in love with its power  
I believe in its strength  
I got a head full of ideas  
It's drivin' me insane  
But until then  
  
It's dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, all right  
Yeah dynamite on Friday night  
Under the big city lights  
All right, all right, one time  
It's dynamite, oh yes it's dynamite  
It's just dynamite on friday night  
It's dynamite, it's on friday night  
Oh friday night  
It's all right, all right, wired  
It's dynamite on friday night  
Under the big city lights  
It's all right, all right  
All together
