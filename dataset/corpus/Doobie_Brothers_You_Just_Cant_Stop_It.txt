Who's gonna make you feel just right  
When that music's playin'  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that music's playin'  
When the thing cuts loose it's out-a hand  
You know you just can't stop it  
Can't sit in your chair, you got to stand  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
  
Whole damn place keeps blowin' higher, yeah  
Guitar man sets the strings on fire  
Hey, now it's 'bout time to set things straight  
You know you just can't stop it  
So now it's time to advocate  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
  
Who's gonna make you feel just right  
When that music's playin'  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that music's playin'  
When the thing cuts loose it's out-a hand  
You know you just can't stop it  
Can't sit in your chair, you got to stand  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild
