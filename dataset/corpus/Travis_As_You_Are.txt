Everyday I wake up alone  
I'm not like the other boys  
And ever since I was young  
I had no choice  
  
But it's OK to lead me on  
I admit it's not much fun  
To be led on by such a one  
As you are  
As you are  
As you are  
  
And ever since I woke up I felt the net  
Was lifting me out of the sea  
And even when I'm sinking I feel the need  
  
But it's OK to lead me on  
I admit it's not much fun  
To be led on by such a one  
As you are  
As you are  
As you are  
  
And ever since a long time  
I felt the rain  
And there was no danger  
And no more strangers  
As you are
