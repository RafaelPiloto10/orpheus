[Verse 1]  
I don't wanna be your lover  
I don't wanna be your fool  
Pick me up whenever you want it  
Throw me down when you are trough  
Cause I've learned more from what's missing  
It's about me and not about you  
I know I made some bad decisions  
But my last one was you...  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me googbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Verse 2]  
You say I can do it better  
Better than someone like you  
What I feel, can't write in a letter  
So I wrote this for you  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me goodbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
You don't know love 'til it feels like you died when it's missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Bridge]  
(You, you, you, you)  
You won't ever get no better  
(You, you, you, you)  
Got a lot more to lose  
(You, you, you, you)  
You won't ever, ever get it  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
You don't know love 'til it feels like you died when it's missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
(You don't know love)
