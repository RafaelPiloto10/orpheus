Eight ounce gloves now it's title time  
You can use your chosen tools and I'll choose mine  
I'm afraid we've gone and laid it on the line it's a risky bizness  
Oh in the garden time to go show them crazies who's the one who runs the show  
While they gamble in your corner for your robe it's a risky bizness  
And the best that you can do is buy some time till they can find somebody
better  
It don't matter what they call you  
When you know you've been the best that you could be  
Give 'em hell boy while you can make 'em fight to take the title you defend  
Till they nail you with some double-cross again it's a risky bizness
