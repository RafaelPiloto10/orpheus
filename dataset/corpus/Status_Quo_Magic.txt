Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
And I've tied very hard just to see if I could forget ya  
But never, ever could we get back together  
I doubt it somehow, doubt it, yes I do  
  
Did you think that I would be so good that it wouldn't matter  
And did you feel at the time that the weight of the time is greater  
It's magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know I'll be there  
Don't worry me you know I'll be there  
No matter if it's day or night, you  
Why worry if I say I'll be there  
  
Did it all, looking back at the road, maybe lacked some measure  
Could it be, could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure, my pleasure  
  
But magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know I'll be there  
Don't worry me you know I'll be there  
Won't matter if it's day or night, you  
Why worry if I say I'll be there  
  
Right or wrong, it's still the same  
It's a win-or-lose-it game  
  
Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
Could it be, could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure, my pleasure  
  
But magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
Magic, oh it's magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
Magic, oh it's magic, everything else has had it...
