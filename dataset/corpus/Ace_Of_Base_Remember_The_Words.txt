You got to believe me  
Remember the words  
Remember the words  
  
When you're down on your knees  
And without a friend  
Standing afraid at the very end  
Back on your own  
Lonely and lost again  
Try to forget what you're going through  
Think of the things that you're gonna do  
Lift up your eyes  
Like they told you to  
Told you to  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Baby say never ever  
We go up  
We go down  
But we never stop  
We're gonna work it until we drop  
Moving along  
You're gonna be on top  
Don't be afraid you are not alone  
Don't ever think you're on your own  
Lift up your eyes  
You'll make it home  
Make it home  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
You got to believe me  
There is a reason  
Why you're crying  
And what ever you may do  
Don't forget to keep on trying  
Do what you got to do  
I said believe in you  
  
(Oh Yeah) Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Remember the words  
Remember the words
