i love a mean mean man  
he lives uptown  
when i want him he's never around  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
now he calls up and wants a date at 8  
he's never on time he's always late  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
now we go to a dance, he holds me tight  
but he don't even kiss me goodnight  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man but i love him all i can  
i know i'm a fool to love that man  
but i'm gonna love him as long as i can  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man  
he's a mean mean man but i love him all i can
