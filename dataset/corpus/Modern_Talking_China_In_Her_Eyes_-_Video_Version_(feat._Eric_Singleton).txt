From New York to Hong Kong  
And back again  
It's the No.1 fun maker in the nation  
Making you dance  
  
She wanna rub me down, keep my muscles strong  
Keep it going on, from New York to Hong Kong  
Think of something freeky in a crazy form  
As long as I don't have to put ma pants back on  
She's the girl I never had, she's the girl of my dreams  
A body like a Lamborgini covered in jeans  
Too much for a man much more than I can stand  
Wanna pack my bags aud move to Japan....  
  
She has China in her eyes -can't you see it  
China in her eyes - can't you feel it  
China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my china woman, oh no  
I miss you so, can't let you go - my China girl - don't go  
  
From Paris to Bankok  
I just can't stop  
You feel the music all around the world  
My China girl - Come on!  
  
Let me get tonight, you know I'll treat you right  
Want China in your eyes, 'til the morning light  
The next day you'll realize, I'll be holding you tight  
Because the love you be giving is dynamite  
I wanna freak you here, i wanna freak you there  
I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Tall as the China wall I wanna feel the world  
Let nothing come between me and my China girl  
  
She has China in her eyes -can't you see it  
China in her eyes - can't you feel it  
China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my China woman, oh no  
I miss you so, can't let you go - my China girl - don't go  
  
From the moon to the stars  
And all around the universe  
This is a dedication to you  
China in your Eyes
