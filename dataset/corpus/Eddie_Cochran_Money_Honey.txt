You know the land-lady's ringin' my frontdoor bell  
I let it ring for a long-long spell  
Went to the window, peeked through the blinds, I said  
Honey just exactly what you got on your mind  
She said, money honey (money honey)  
Money honey (money honey), money honey (yeah)  
If you gonna get along with me  
Well I screamed and hollered, I was so hard-pressed  
I called the woman that I love best  
Got my baby 'bout half past three, she says  
Eddie boy, just exactly what you want with me  
I said, money honey (money honey)  
Money honey (money honey), money honey (yeah)  
If you gonna get along with me  
  
Well I learned my lesson and now I know  
The sun may shine and a wind may blow  
Women may come and women may go, but  
Well I said I love you honey, I just want you to know  
I want, money honey (money hone. Y)  
Money honey (money honey), money honey (yeah)  
If you gonna get along with me
