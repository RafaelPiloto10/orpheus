I might forgive, but I won't forget  
Believe me, baby  
You swear you changed your ways  
You ain't proved it yet  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If I'm gonna take you back  
After the pain I've had  
Well, I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition  
  
Do me right, don't do me wrong  
Come home every night, no more carryin' on  
I explain my position  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If I'm gonna take you back  
After the pain I've had  
Well, I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition
