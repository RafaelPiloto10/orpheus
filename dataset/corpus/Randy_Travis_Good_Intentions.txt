Mama always prayed that I'd be a better man than daddy  
And I determined not to let her down  
Deserted by the man she loved and left to raise four children  
We were the local gossip of the town.  
  
I promised her that I'd live right and not be like the others  
But I wound up in jail on Christmas day  
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers  
When I got home my mom had passed away  
  
(chorus)  
And I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions  
And mama my intentions were the best  
There's lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention  
Looks like I've turned out like all the rest  
But mama my intentions were the best  
  
A little boy with big blue eyes a-beggin' to go fishing  
I promised him but never took the time  
Now they won't let me see him and I sit here a-wishing  
Wishin' I could hold him one more time  
  
(repeat chorus)  
But mama my intentions were the best
