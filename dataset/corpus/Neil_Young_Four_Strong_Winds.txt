Think I'll go out to Alberta  
Weather's good there in the fall  
I got some friends that I could go to working for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind  
If I ask you one more time  
But we've been through this a hundred times or more  
  
chorus: Four strong winds that blow lonely  
Seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change, Come what may.  
If all the good times are all gone  
Then I'm bound for movin' on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are lookin' good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare.  
But, by then it would be winter  
Not too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold 'way out there.

And those wind sure can blow way out there.
