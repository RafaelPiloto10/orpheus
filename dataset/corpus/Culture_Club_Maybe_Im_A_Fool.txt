(rap intro by derick johnson)  
Dangerous lover  
With the blue-green eyes  
Slides into the room  
He's got trouble on his mind  
Maybe you're misunderstood  
So come and lie here by my side  
'cause your love it hurts so good  
Every time, every time  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
But love's so hard to find  
I keep searching every time  
Foolish words spoken  
Forgotten in the night  
When the sun meets the ocean  
I wanna be here by your side  
Let me give you all those things  
That money just can't buy  
'cause your love it hurts so good  
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool, but I love you baby, baby...  
(rap by derick johnson)  
(I keep searching everytime)  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Baby you're misunderstood  
So come and lie here by my side  
Cause your love it hurts so good  
Don't ask me why, just don't ask me why  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yeah  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your loving  
Right now  
Love's so hard to find  
I keep searching every time  
All the time, all the time  
Cause I can't live without you  
Can't live without you  
Maybe maybe baby I'm a fool for your loving (repeat until end)
