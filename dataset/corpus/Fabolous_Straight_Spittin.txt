"straight spiitin"  
fabolous  
desert storm

Fabolous  
brooklin we back  
  
Fabolous:  
i cant deny it  
u a dick rider  
u can never flow like me  
blow like me, y would a bitch like ya?  
when they can see that I'm a fucking rider , u a hitch-hiker  
u never seen a coup that gone a-robbin  
the dealer says the same beamer bond was driving  
2-20 on the z-a dash  
when the 3-a flash  
turn ur brains to a v8 splash and ur body  
with this lifestyle poster style  
I get right like a lifestyle poster child  
niggas in the game as haggy  
when u put the heat to him they talk the same as shaggy "it wasn't me "  
nigga u cant even think a freestyles on ur own  
got 911 on speedial on ur phone  
still nuttin  
i roll for thous now  
got every ghetto girl going crazy  
thats too old for bow wow  
  
yo  
I got the feds in paranoia  
I'm the only kid that come to court in a pair of nikes  
with a pair of lawers  
who murders wen they walk  
Have witness sayin duh-duh-duh-duh to nervous to talk  
Ship niggas is opposed  
To put insurance on their bitch  
cuz now i ship niggas for their hoes  
only take 5 of these spraid  
After I roll up behind you like privacy shades  
All y'all could do is look at my studs and shiver  
Or be rocking my watch  
At the bottom of the Hudson River  
Want to get me for my dough then fine  
But u better be a model for a bullet proof clothin line  
You'all see the size of the bags that my dope be in  
Got niggas pockets lookin like Ethiopians  
You broke niggas could be fixed and  
I'm the reason ain't no original and the already talkin REMIX  
  
Paul Cain:  
  
It's Paul Cain season again  
I'm like a 2k pee-wee kirkland  
study old-timers learn to put easy workin  
Know these niggas wanna see me hurtin  
That's what would get them shot poped up with the D.E squirt gun  
Still focused on flippin them packs  
Cop the ESCALADE on 20's with the system in back  
Come thru gucci jeans suits fisherman hat  
Why the white ubs Double G stiched in the back  
Since half y'all haters learn the aim able to stear  
handle the wheel like NASCAR racers  
I'm 5'7 tower over every oppenent  
Ask CLUE where he got the title HEAVY COMPONENTS  
Quietly I'm the best in the game  
I'm never changin my image juz adding specs and a chain  
And y'all niggaz know it's on for life  
PAUL CAIN, FABOLOUS, CLUE DESERT STORM for life
