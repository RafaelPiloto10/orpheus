In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,  
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.
