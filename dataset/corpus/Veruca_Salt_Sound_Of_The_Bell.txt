Found a place where we can talk  
I found a way to reach a little ground  
Keep your castle in my sandbox  
Build it up so we can burn it down  
  
Anyway I love my man  
Love to keep him spinning round and round  
Keep him feeling love for my hand  
Any way to turn him inside out  
  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
Meet me up and down again  
Every time is sweeter than the last  
Once you get a taste of impact  
  
You're always hungry for the crash  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
And this is everything  
I have loved  
  
Yeah, I have loved  
Break  
My  
Heart  
  
Down, I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
Yeah  
(I don't want to be found in the sunshine  
  
I don't want to be dim like a night light  
I don't want to be down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight
