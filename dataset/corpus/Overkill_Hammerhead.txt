Feeling the pain as it rips through my brain  
Twisting what's left of my mind.  
Tearing the same, this blood burning flame  
Decaying all it can find.  
  
Banging your head, stuck in the dread,  
Leaving the posers behind.  
Powers you see, the power you need  
Nerves and bones we grind.  
  
Hammer! Hammerhead.  
Hammer! Hammerhead.  
  
Knocked to the floor, left wanting more.  
Scars decorate your face...  
Playing the game, your never the same  
The heat is melting this place  
  
Emotion and fire!!, you never tire  
Running a death metal race...  
Knife in the back, guitar heart attack  
Murder, rest my case.  
  
Hammer! Hammerhead  
Hammer! Hammerhead  
  
No one can stop, our way to the top!  
No one can get in the way  
Neck snapping force, taking its course.  
Keeping the dogs at bay.  
  
Nailed to the wall, giving your all  
We know that you ain't dead.  
We know your name, know why you came  
Your a fucking hammerhead.  
  
Hammer! Hammerhead.  
Hammer! Hammerhead!  
Hammer! Hammerhead!...  
Hammer! Hammer!
