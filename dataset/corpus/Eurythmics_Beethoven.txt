Take a girl like that  
And put her in a natural setting  
Like a cafe for example.  
Along comes the boy  
And he's looking for trouble  
With a girl like that  
With a girl like that.  
Who knows what they'll decide to do.  
Who knows what they'll get up to.  
I'd love to know.  
Wouldn't you?  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...  
  
You think you know just what you want  
But you have used that weapon agianst me.  
Did I tell you I was lying by the way  
When I said I wanted a new mink coat.  
I was just thinking about  
Something sleek  
To wrap around my tender throat  
I was dreaming like a texan girl  
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything.  
A girl who thinks she should have  
Something extreme.  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...
