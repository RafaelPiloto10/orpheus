When you see your face in the mirror  
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer  
All your life you spent as a wheeler  
Now the hole you dug, it's gettin' deeper  
You're talkin' words  
But they don't make the rhyme  
You'll lose it all  
'Cause you can't draw the line  
You got nothin'  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
You're hurtin' over time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
And we don't need your time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
Pushin', shovin', got no time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
When you see the day gettin' darker  
You can run to your lies, run to your cover  
When you feel the heat from a lover  
You hit the highway lookin' for another  
You made the grade  
You left the hills behind  
You take the cake and eat it  
You're so blind  
You got nothin'  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
You're hurtin' over time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
And we don't need your time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
Pushin', shovin', got no time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
You're hurtin' over time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
And we don't need your time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
Pushin', shovin', got no time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
You're hurtin' over time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
And we don't need your time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
Pushin', shovin', got no time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
You're hurtin' over time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
And we don't need your time  
(Nothin' for nothin')  
Pushin', shovin', got no time  
Hey, you're hurtin' over time
