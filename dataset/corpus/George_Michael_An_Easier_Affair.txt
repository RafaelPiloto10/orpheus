Here comes one for the ladies  
For the ones who love me  
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man  
I told myself I was straight  
But I shouldn't have worried  
'Cos my Maker had a better plan for me  
  
And I'm dancing with the freaks now  
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun  
What you sow is what you reap now  
I'll do my dance with everyone  
I've been getting too much Sun  
(Yes I'm dancin' with the freaks now)  
We're havin', we're havin' too much fun for them  
Look who's talking Guilty feet now'  
  
Well let me tell you people  
It's an easier affair  
Not living my life with other people on my mind  
No, got nothing to hide from anyone  
Yes, I'm walking on new air  
Just living my life  
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine  
See I don't have the time  
For the haters  
  
And all the time that I wasted  
How careless of me  
Too young and stupid to see  
I put my life in their hands  
(Gonna look for Cupid, man)  
Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them  
There's no hurry  
I'll just have to be the bigger man  
  
Dancin' with the freaks now  
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun  
What you sow is what you reap now  
I'll do my dance with everyone  
I've been getting too much Sun  
If I turn the other cheek now  
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them'  
Look who's talking  
Guilty feet now'  
  
Well let me tell you people  
It's an easier affair  
Not livin' my life with other people on my mind  
No, got nothing to hide from anyone  
'Cos I'm walking on new air  
Just living my life  
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine  
See I don't have the time for the haters  
  
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough  
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong  
Or that you won't find love  
  
Don't let them use my life to put your future down  
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found  
  
For my life  
  
Take it to the streets  
There are stories you can keep  
They're just passing you by  
  
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough  
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong  
Or that you won't find love  
  
Don't let them use my life to put your future down  
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found
