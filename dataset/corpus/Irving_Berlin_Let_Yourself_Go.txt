As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?  
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?  
If you step out on the floor  
You'll forget your trouble  
If you go into your dance  
You'll forget your woe  
So:  
Come  
Get together  
Let the dance floor feel your leather  
Step as lightly as a feather  
Let yourself go  
Come  
Hit the timber  
Loosen up and start to limber  
Can't you hear that hot marimba?  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Relax  
And let yourself go  
Relax  
You've got yourself tied up in a knot  
The night is cold but the music's hot  
So  
Come  
Cuddle closer  
Don't you dare to answer "No, sir"  
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer  
Let yourself go
