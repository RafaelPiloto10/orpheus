Where's the love we had?  
When do it go bad?  
Or am I just insecure?  
I give all I can  
Baby I'm your man  
Tell me what were in this for  
Remind me  
  
Chorus  
I can't go on  
I know not what to do  
My heart is worn  
I feel as if I'm through  
Please believe in me  
'cause what I need is for you  
To believe in me  
  
Coutless sleepless nights  
Never ending fights  
I'm trying to make your dreams come true  
I will sacrifice  
To find paradise  
But I need to know that you're  
Behind me  
  
Chorus  
I can't go on  
I know not what to do  
My heart is worn  
I feel as if I'm through  
Please believe in me  
'cause what I need is for you  
To believe in me
