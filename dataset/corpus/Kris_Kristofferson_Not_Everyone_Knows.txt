Not everyone knows how sweet your kiss is  
Not everyone knows how warm your hand is  
How soft your lips are and when you like to take your time  
How sweet your love flows not everyone knows  
[ piano ]  
Not everyone knows what your favorite song is  
Not everyone knows what your idea of wrong is  
The things that you laugh at and the things that make you cry  
Your highs and your lows not everyone knows  
What's everybody sayin' doesn't matter to much the best part of love doesn't
show  
The feelin' we feel when we touch is such we're the only ones who should know  
What's between you and me is ours together  
It's easy and free and keeps gettin' better  
We're not tryin' to hide no anything no everything shows  
What makes it grow not everyone knows  
Not everyone knows your highs and your lows not everyone knows  
Not everyone knows
