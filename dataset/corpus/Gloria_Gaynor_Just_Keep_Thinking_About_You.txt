All the time  
Tell me why I just keep thinking about you baby  
  
Tell me if you can  
Why I keep thinking about you baby  
Ain't at all like I just wanna  
I just keep thinking about you baby  
  
Lord knows I got things to do  
But they are all neglected, pushed aside by you  
Oh, there is just no time and my head gets crowded  
Ooh yeah, you're always on my mind  
  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
  
There is no way  
I'll stop thinking about you baby  
You go with me day to day  
I can't stop thinking about my baby  
  
Just a simple story about a lonely lady  
Finding herself in love  
And, oh, that is amazing, I won't be complaining  
That means I would not change a thing 'cause I  
  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
  
A happy ending to my story  
And all because of you  
You tell me that you loved me  
And I believe you do  
  
I'm gonna be so patient  
Baby, just take your time  
Our love keeps growing stronger  
And stronger all the time  
  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
  
Just keep thinking about you baby  
Just keep thinking about you baby
