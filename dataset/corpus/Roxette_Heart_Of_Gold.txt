I want to live, I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
It's these expressions I never give  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
Keep me searching for a Heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been admired by, it's such a fine light  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
Keep me searching for a Heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
Keep me searching for a heart of gold  
Keep me searching and I'm growing old
