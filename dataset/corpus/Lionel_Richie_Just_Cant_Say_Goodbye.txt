Here I stand  
Without an overcoat in January  
Where did I go wrong  
I try to smile  
But my heart's a heavy load to carry  
Baby, now you're gone  
  
Maybe there's a way to stop  
The rain before it's falling  
Maybe I'm a fool to even try  
  
But I can't say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay  
And I can't tell you why  
I know the feeling's gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just can't say goodbye  
  
Here I go  
Running after dreams and chasing rainbows  
Trying to hold on to your heart  
I made it through another lonely night  
Just thinking of you  
I long to be right where you are  
  
Maybe there's a way to stop  
The hands of time from turning  
Maybe it just hurts too much to try  
  
But I can't say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay  
And I can't tell you why  
I know the feeling's gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just can't say goodbye  
  
Maybe there's a way to stop  
The rain before it's falling  
Maybe I'm a fool to even try  
  
I can't say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay, oh yeah  
And I can't tell you why  
Yes, I know the feeling's gone, and I know I should be strong  
But I just can't say goodbye  
  
No I just can't say goodbye
