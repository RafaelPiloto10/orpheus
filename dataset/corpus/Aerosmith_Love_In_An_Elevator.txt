Workin' like a dog fo de boss man  
Workin' for de company  
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'  
I'm gonna have a fantasy  
But where am I gonna look?  
They tell me that love is blind  
I really need a girl like an open book  
To read between the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground  
  
Jacki's in the elevator  
Lingerie second floor  
She said 'can I see you later  
And love you just a little more?'  
I kinda hope we get stuck  
Nobody gets out alive  
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room  
Honey and have you home by five  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the air, in the air, honey one more time not, it ain't fair  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down  
  
Love in an  
Elevator  
Goin' down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a penthouse pauper  
Gonna be a millionaire  
I'm gonna be a real fast talker  
And have me a love affair  
Gotta get my timin' right  
It's a test that I gotta pass  
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey  
Kiss your sassafras  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you care? Do you care?  
Honey one more time now it ain't fair.  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
