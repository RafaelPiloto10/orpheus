OK. Oh no! not you!  
What are you doing here?  
Oh boy it's gonna be hard now  
Can we put him in the back?  
Robin, Robin, Robin  
  
I used to get dressed for you all,  
I don't do that no more, I'm sorry  
It's a new day, I don't have the energy  
  
Y'all like my jokes?  
  
OK so, ah, these are brand new songs, that a very few people have heard hm  
Very much about, you know, whatever, I been going trough and what I been  
Learning lot of her, wonderful life lessons, you know, that are easy to
combine  
But you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you
had  
To go trough, is it very important that you really listen to the words, you  
Know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please raise your
hand  
You know, object, whatever, you guys ready in there? (All set) OK  
  
And I, you know, It's really interesting because I used to  
I used to be a performer,  
And I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore,  
I'm really just, you know I'm sharing, you know,  
More or less the music that I've been giving,  
But if I stop, if I start, if I, you know,  
Feel like saying "baby, baby, baby" for,  
Eighteen bars, whatever, you know,  
I just I do that  
  
So you guys are cool? (Yeah!)  
OK I'm talking to people in my head too,  
It's alright though.. This is worth my "ape lope"  
I'm just gonna finish sucking on my Lazenger  
  
OK so this particular song is called Mr. Intentional  
"will see, we tune that now"  
This is  
One "ape lope"
