You've got me so I'm running round and round in circles.  
You've got me so I can't see my own face.  
You've got me so I feel like I've been like this forever.  
You've got me so I'm crazy with disgrace.  
(Chorus)  
I know what's on your mind  
But its not what you think it is.  
I know what's on your mind  
But its not what you think it is.  
I'm running on a treadmill after you  
I'm running on a treadmill now.  
I'm running on a treadmill after you  
I'm running on a treadmill now.  
You've got me so I'm running round and round in circles.  
You've got me so I can't see my own face.  
You've got me so I feel like I've been like this forever.  
You've got me so I'm crazy with disgrace.  
(Repeat Chorus)
