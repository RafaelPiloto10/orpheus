[Intro: Pitbull]  
Travis Barker  
Joe Perry  
Robin Thicke  
And yours truly  
This is history in the making  
  
[Refrain: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]  
(Now say it with me)  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
(Say it with me)  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

[Verse 1: Pitbull]  
They say he don't rap no more  
They say like LeBron he ain't got the heat no more  
They say he ain't street no more  
But like Jay say "How sick am I?" wish 'em health for sure  
But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it  
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it  
It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me  
I thank God every day that music saved me  
I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me  
I thank Miami for the way you raised me  
  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]  
I'm a bad man, in an evil world  
(That's right)  
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl  
(Give it to me baby)  
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world  
(Ha, ha)  
Come on over, give me what I deserve  
(Give it to me baby)  
  
[Refrain: Robin Thicke]  
Are you ready for love?  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
  
[Verse 2: Pitbull]  
Building a billion dollar business from an ounce  
Not bad for a Cuban that came from the south  
Mami let's make like tig ol' bitties and bounce  
So we can make like a baby in here now  
I'm cool with it, act a fool with it  
With my own playbook, I got no rules in it  
I like the girls that's freaky, wild, yeah, and crazy  
I like the girls that dirty dance, I'm Swayze  
I like the girls that's hot, and fire and blazing  
I like the girls that like the sex amazing  
  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]  
I'm a bad man, in an evil world  
(That's right)  
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl  
(Give it to me baby)  
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world  
(Ha, ha)  
Come on over, give me what I deserve  
(Give it to me baby)  
  
[Refrain: Robin Thicke]  
Are you ready for love?  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
  
[Bridge: Pitbull]  
I'm a bad man  
I know how to move in a room full of woo's  
Baby, I'm a bad man  
I'm a good man, good guy, but don't get it confused  
Baby, I'm a bad man  
And I still fight every day like I ain't got nothing to lose  
That's right  
  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]  
I'm a bad man, in an evil world  
(That's right)  
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl  
(Give it to me baby)  
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world  
(Ha, ha)  
Come on over, give me what I deserve  
(Give it to me baby)  
  
[Refrain: Robin Thicke]  
Are you ready for love?  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah  
Oooh  
Come and get it, girl  
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
