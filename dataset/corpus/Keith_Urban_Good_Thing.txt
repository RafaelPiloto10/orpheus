Mmm, just hold it now, let me put my drink down  
Baby, tell me are you really for real?  
Swingin side-to-side, doin that electric slide  
Spinnin' on your pretty little cowgirl boot heels  
And you're all alone and that ain't right  
A girl like you should have the best of everything  
Like someone to treat you right  
What I wouldn't give to hold you close  
Longer than tonight  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more  
  
The possibilities, mmm, they're killin' me  
Like you're killin' every dude in the room with the way you move  
And you ain't slowin' down, my heads spinnin' round  
But this neon buzz is a-gettin' me up and I wanna get down with you  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
If you let me be your man you'll never be lonely no more
