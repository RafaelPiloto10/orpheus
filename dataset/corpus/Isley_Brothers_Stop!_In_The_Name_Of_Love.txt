Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
  
Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go  
Each time you leave my door  
I watch you walk down the street  
Knowing your other love you'll meet  
This time before you run to her  
Leaving me alone and hurt  
(Think it over) After I've been good to you?  
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've known of your, your secluded nights  
I've even seen her maybe once or twice  
But is her sweet expression  
Worth more than my love and affection?  
But this time before you leave my arms  
And rush off to her charms  
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?  
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient  
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation  
But each time you are together  
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart
