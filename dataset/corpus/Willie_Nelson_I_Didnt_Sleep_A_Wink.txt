Didn't sleep a wink last night,  
'Cause you walked out the night before.  
Just been sittin' here, rottin', hoping you'd come knockin',  
Knocking at my door.  
  
Watched the moon pass by my window,  
The stars faded out of sight.  
The sun came into view, an' still I thought of you,  
An' I didn't sleep a wink last night.  
  
Tryin' to remember what I'd done,  
To make you treat me so.  
What have I been guilty of?  
Well, I'd just like to know.  
  
Thought if we could talk it over,  
Maybe I could make things right.  
'Cause until I'm forgiven, I'm exisitin', I'm not livin',  
An' I didn't sleep a wink last night.  
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
