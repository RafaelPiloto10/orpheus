I got to see you, baby, I don't care  
It may be some place, baby, you say you where  
I had a dream about you, baby  
A dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.  
  
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk  
You make me nervous when you start to talk  
I had a dream about you, baby  
A dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.  
  
Standin' on the highway, you flag me down  
Said, take me, daddy to the nearest town  
I had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.  
  
The join is jumpin' it's really somethin'  
The beat is pumpin', my heart is thumpin'  
Spent my money on you honey  
My limbs are shakin', my heart is breakin'  
  
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop  
You made me so bad, you gotta stop  
I had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.  
  
The join in jumpin' it's really somethin'  
The beat is pumpin', my heart is thumpin'  
Spent my money on you honey  
My limbs are shakin', my heart is breakin'  
  
You had a white rag wrapped around your head  
Wearing a long dress fire engine red  
I had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
