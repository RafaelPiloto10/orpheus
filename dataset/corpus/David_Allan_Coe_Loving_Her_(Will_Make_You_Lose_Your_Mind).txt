By David Allan Coe  
SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN THAT KIND OF WOMAN  
SHELL DRINK WHISKEY AND DANCE TILL THE CHAMPAGNES ALL GONE  
SHELL BE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE AIR FROM THE OCEAN IS CALLING  
TELLING YOU, SAILOR BEWARE! SOMETHING IS WRONG!  
  
BUT TOUCHING HER MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR BLUES TONIGHT  
HOLDING HER MIGHT STOP THE PAIN IN TIME  
KISSING HER MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE LONELINESS YOU FELL  
BUT LOVING HER WILL MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND  
  
JUST LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS SHELL BE GONE IN THE MORNING  
LEAVING YOU EMPTY AND DRAINED, LIKE THE TIDE YOU'LL BE LOW  
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL BETTER  
YOU'LL TRY TO BUY HER WITH PRESENTS , BUT SAILOR I KNOW.
