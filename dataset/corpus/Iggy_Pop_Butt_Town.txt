The cops are well-groomed, with  
Muscled physiques in butt town  
Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic  
In butt town  
Any young black male who walks down the street  
Is gonna get stopped by a car full of meat  
But the girl with the hair  
Flies by in her underwear-  
  
She's done nothing so far to deserve that car  
When you live in butt town  
You gotta get down  
But in butt town I'm learnin'  
In butt town I'm earnin'  
In butt town I'm turnin'  
Into my worst nightmare  
  
I'm tellin' you, it's a motley crew in butt town  
Monday you're new, and Friday you're through  
In butt town  
The producer is wily, and owns what he sells  
The talent is eager to go straight to hell  
Th tits are amazing, and everyone's gazing  
At some body part-  
That's the nature of art in butt town  
  
All over butt town dreams have a show down  
All over butt town values are thrown down  
But in butt town I'm learnin'  
In butt town I'm earnin'  
In butt town I'm turnin'  
Into my worst nightmare  
  
In butt town baby  
I'm gonna be a star  
I'm gonna shake my butt far  
Now here we go  
I'm gonna shake my butt  
Shake my butt shake my butt  
In butt town
