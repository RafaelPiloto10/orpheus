I'm going way down south to Louisiana, tonight  
Well, I'll just close my eyes  
And everything's alright  
And though I'm really far away  
I'll make my get away  
And no one need really  
Know that I've been gone  
  
One more time for the good times  
That far out weigh the bad  
One more time for the good times  
When love was all we had  
  
I'm going way down south to Baton Rouge  
Well, I'll just close the door  
And turn out all the lights  
And all the images dance by  
Of folks and friends who lie  
Back home where things are slow  
And easy going  
  
One more time for the good times  
That far out weigh the bad  
One more time for the good times  
When love was all  
When love was all  
When love was all we had  
One more time
