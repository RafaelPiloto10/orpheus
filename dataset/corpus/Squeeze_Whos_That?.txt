Who's that kissin' in the corner?  
And who's that talkin' on the phone?  
Who's that smilin' like a soldier?  
And why you tellin' me to go?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?  
  
As blind as a bat  
As wise as an owl  
Let go of me, let go of me now  
Who is that, who is that, who is that?  
  
Who's that playin' a sonata?  
And who's that mimicin' my nerves?  
Who's that actin' like Sinatra?  
And why has angel dressed in furs?  
  
So who's that walkin' like the penguin?  
And who's that handin' me a stout?  
Who's that always never ending?  
And no I didn't even come.  
  
So who's that dancin' kind of reggea?  
And who's that askin' for a fight?  
Who's that? Is it necassary  
To kick me out into the night?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?
