Talk about lovers  
They're bothyoung and very pretty  
They're in love but he betrays her  
He says sorry and so she wants  
To believe him that it's why  
He's got her on his hooks  
Bridge  
What you do to me I can do to you  
Babe set me free then I'll let you be  
Come on, come on nowdon't you fool around  
Cause you're hurting me  
Won't you let me be  
Chorus  
You got me on your hooks  
You're a bastard  
You got me on your hooks  
You're a bastard  
You know it's true  
You got me on your hooks  
Then one day he decides to marry her  
She doesn't want to  
Because she doesn't believe him  
I saw you kissing that girl last week  
But I still think you love me  
That' why you got me  
Bridge  
Chorus  
I know it's crazy  
But I know it won't be long  
I know it's crazy  
But I know I will survive lalala lalala  
Bridge  
You got me on you're hooks
