I remember as a kid wishin' I was seventeen  
No more school, my own car.  
Back then it was all a dream  
Then came the day to say goodbye  
To the room that was once mine  
One last look at my old world then  
I closed the door behind, to  
  
[Chorus]  
Yesterday, everything was easy  
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow  
Now everyday memories still remind me  
How good things used to be yesterday  
  
Well thirty-five soon rolled around  
And everything had changed  
I could count friends on one hand and  
The good times weren't the same  
But finally I cam to understand why people say  
Don't spend all your childhood wishin'  
The best years away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm longin' for the freedom  
That I let slip away  
I took it all for granted  
Now it's gone like yesterday  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Remembering all those years, yesterday
