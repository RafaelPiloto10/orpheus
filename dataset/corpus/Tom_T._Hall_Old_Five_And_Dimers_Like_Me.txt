I've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be  
More than the measure of what I thought others could see  
Good luck and fast bucks they're too few and too far between  
There's catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me  
She stood beside me letting me know she would be  
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me  
Well fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not ever will be  
The reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me  
  
Well it's taking me so long now that I know I believe  
All that I do or say is all I ever will be  
Too far and too high and too deep ain't too much to see  
Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me  
An old five and dimer is all I intended to be  
(You know country people don't shine their boots very often  
And they don't shine other folks' boots either thank you)
