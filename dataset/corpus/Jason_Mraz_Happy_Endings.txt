You are naked  
Standing at the other end of this  
Poison arrow  
I am William tell  
And you are the girl with the golden apple  
And you are hungry to be swept off your feet  
You wanna do this out in the open  
But my aim is often weak  
And you fear my shoulders sloping  
Your split ends will end up falling anyway  
Before the weight of the apple world  
Gets to turn them all grey  
And your eyes they need  
Calming down  
  
Well you are wise  
And you are free  
To let the apple touch the ground  
Or keep it standing tall  
Cause this won't hurt at all  
  
You are half asleep  
You're half of a girl  
And half of a child  
Maybe five feet deep  
You're as tall as the world  
Up to your eyes  
And you've been hogging all the sheets  
Often balling them up  
Even drawing a line  
And spending half of your time  
Deciding to roll over  
When you do  
  
I'll be there with a smile  
Expanding far and wide  
And I pull you in much closer  
In my dreams you are queen of the ball  
And sometimes you off my head  
Well to me it's a happy ending  
For you I'd fall  
Cause that wouldn't hurt at all  
Not at all  
  
While this woman is sleeping here  
I tell her what I can't if I were to wake her  
Powerful but hardly will she ever hear the,  
The secrets I've saved up  
  
Well you are famous indeed  
For all your shyness  
Ain't that sweet  
Ain't this a fine mess  
We're in so deep  
I must've got lost in the process  
Just let things be easy  
And an honest boy you've made me  
Because the solice that you gave me  
Was proven problems ain't the main thing to fall apart  
The archers sloping shoulders  
Well any story's tale is tall  
Thus reminding love is allegorical  
I mean the goal here after all  
Is not to hurt at all
