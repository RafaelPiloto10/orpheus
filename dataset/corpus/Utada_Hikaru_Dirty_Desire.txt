Dirty desire [Repeat: x3]  
  
There's something that's been growing inside of me  
Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh baby baby  
I haven't been myself since we met last week  
Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh baby baby  
  
When I'm alone at night  
I sit and fantasize  
And in my fantasies I love you long time  
Doing my nine to five  
I'm thinking six and nine  
I gotta make you mine  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
Dirty desire  
  
Dirty desire, dirty desire, dirty desire, dirty desire  
  
I know you thought about it  
But it's all in your head  
And you can't wait to see me  
To see me in the flesh  
I see you really need to  
Get this thing off your chest  
But all you know, I gotta get you back in my nest  
  
I try to let it go  
But that made me want you more  
'Cause in reality I know you're not mine  
I don't want just a fight, I want the full size  
Tell her I'll pay the fine  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
Dirty desire  
  
When I'm alone at night  
I sit and fantasize  
And in my fantasies I love you long tonight  
Doing my nine to five  
I'm thinking six and nine  
I gotta make you mine  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
Dirty desire  
  
Now what you doing, babe  
You're not my boyfriend  
Long as we know babe, I'm not your girlfriend  
Now what you doing, babe  
You're not my boyfriend  
Long as we know babe, I'm not your girlfriend  
  
Desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire  
  
Bring that beat back! [Repeat: x4]
