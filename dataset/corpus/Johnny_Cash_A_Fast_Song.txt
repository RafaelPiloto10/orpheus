The only thing that 'll move me now is a fast song  
Song long and barely known  
And I don't wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song.  
Kick it off and let's all pick a fast song.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Dideldiedie...  
  
Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandelin  
But let it in, if it wants in.  
Keep the rosin' handed and the horse there tough and tight.  
Pick it up and I'm lyable to pick all night.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Repeat last verse, but a little faster.
