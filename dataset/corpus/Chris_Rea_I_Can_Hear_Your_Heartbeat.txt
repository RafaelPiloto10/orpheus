In the silence of the side street  
In the whisper of the night  
From the darkness of the empty hours  
To the early morning light  
From the hustle down on main street  
With all it's lights so bright  
To the trucker on the highway  
Pressing through the night  
  
I can hear you heartbeat  
I can hear you heartbeat  
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet  
To me  
  
And I'm sailing on your wind song  
Oh, I can feel the summer breeze  
You've got me walking on my tiptoes  
You've got me standing on my knees  
From the mills way down in Pittsburgh  
To the clubs of gay Paris  
Ah, no matter where I roam, girl,  
You can always get to me (Yeah)  
  
I can hear you heartbeat  
Yeah, I can hear you heartbeat  
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet  
To me  
  
We got freezing Coca-Cola  
We got anything you want  
I moving on that back beat  
Girl, but it's you that sings the song  
  
'Cause I can hear you heartbeat  
I can hear you heartbeat  
The sound of you is so sweet  
To me  
  
Oh I still hear your heartbeat  
Yea I still hear your heartbeat  
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet,  
to me
