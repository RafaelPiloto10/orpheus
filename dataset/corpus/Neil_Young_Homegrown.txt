Homegrown's all right with me.  
Homegrown is the way it should be.  
Homegrown is a good thing.  
Plant that bell and let it ring.  
  
The sun comes up in the morning,  
Shines that light around.  
One day, without no warning,  
Things start jumping up from the ground.  
  
Well, homegrown's all right with me.  
Homegrown is the way it should be.  
Homegrown is a good thing.  
Plant that bell and let it ring.
