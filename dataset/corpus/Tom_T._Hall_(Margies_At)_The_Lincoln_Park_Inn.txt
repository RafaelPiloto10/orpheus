My name's in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike  
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy's bike  
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him  
My wife's in the kitchen and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why she's there 'cause I've been there before  
But I made a promise that I wouldn't cheat anymore  
  
I tried to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend  
My mind's on a number and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
Next Sunday it's my turn to speak to the young people's class  
They expect answers to all of the questions they ask  
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin  
And all of the Margie's at all of the Lincoln Park Inns  
  
The bike is all fixed and my little boy is in bed asleep  
His little ol' puppy is curled in a ball at my feet  
My wife's baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again  
I'm almost out of cigarettes and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why she's there
