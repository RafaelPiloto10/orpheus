Know what I said when I saw you crying  
Hang on that's folly  
I was reeking the head I believed your lying  
You're just a bad memory  
My life was going to be better  
My, why could I never ever see she'd step on me  
  
Well I talked to your friend just the other day  
I was gonna look and raise a smile  
And she hid a smile and she ain't like you  
Been asleep from all the journeys a little while  
My life was going to be better  
  
[Chorus:]  
My, why could I never ever see she'd step on me  
Step on me, step on me, step on me  
Now it's so good I won't waste my time  
On a two year old picture of you  
Oh now that you're gone everything's fine  
  
But you probably think that we're through  
My life was going to be better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But you probably think that we're through  
My life was going to be better  
My, why could I never ever see she'd step on me  
Never ever see she'd step on me
