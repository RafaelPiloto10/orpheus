Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flying in a big airliner  
Chicken flying everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer  
  
Coming into Los Angeles  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico  
Could he ever look much stranger  
Walking in the hall with his things and all  
Smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Hip woman walking on a moving floor  
Tripping on the escalator  
There's a man in the line, and she's blowing his mind  
Thinking that he's already made her  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man
