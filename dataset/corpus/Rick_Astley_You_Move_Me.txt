I go to work in my clean shirt  
I push a pen until half past ten  
I watch the clock there on the wall  
Tic toc, why don't you call  
The boss comes in and walks down the aisles  
He turns around but he never smiles  
He watches me just like a hawk  
And then he says we must talk  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
Son, he says (what) I've got bad news  
Life is hard and you got the blues  
I know you're good I know you work hard  
I'm sorry, son, here are your cards  
I went home and kicked off my shoes  
And asked myself why do I always lose  
But then you rang and everything was fine  
I'm so glad that you are mine  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You're the one thing in my life  
That makes me feel so good inside  
Will you hold me tight tonight  
Oh, girl I wish you would decide  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around
