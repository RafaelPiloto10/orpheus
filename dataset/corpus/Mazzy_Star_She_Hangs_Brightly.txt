She hangs brightly from the tree  
Wonders what she's done to me  
I'm aware of your game  
Come and watch me  
Watch me come down  
Takes me down deep and wide  
Pulls me through to the other side  
She's the winner of her game  
Come and watch her  
Watch her come down  
It stays down  
Sour in truth  
Lies of lovin'  
The story's cheap  
She's the winner of her game  
Come and watch her  
Watch her come down  
Deep and wide  
Inside, inside, inside
