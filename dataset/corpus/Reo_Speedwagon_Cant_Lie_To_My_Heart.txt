I think to much about you baby  
You've on my mind more than you should  
I would do without you now  
I would walk away now if I could  
I never needed anybody baby  
I'm the one who never thought I would  
  
I keep telling myself I don't need you  
I keep telling myself I don't want you, now  
I'd tell myself anything to make me believe  
That I don't love you baby  
But I can't lie to my heart  
  
Something's got me running to you  
Something tells me I can't run away  
Even if I thought of leaving  
The thought of you would only make me stay  
No one's ever gotten to me baby  
I'm the one who always got away  
  
I can't tell the sky that it's not blue  
How can I tell you that I don't love you?
