When I wake up yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you  
When I go out yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you  
If I get drunk yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you  
And if I have yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you  
  
But I would walk 500 miles  
And I would walk 500 more  
Just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles  
  
To fall down at your door  
When I'm working yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you  
And when the money comes in for the work I'll do  
  
I'll pass almost every penny on to you  
When I come home yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you  
And if I grow old well I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you  
  
When I'm lonely yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you  
When I'm dreaming yes I know I'm gonna dream  
Dream about the time when I'm with you
