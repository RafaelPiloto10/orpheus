Darkness settles on the ground  
Leaves the day stumbling blind  
Coming to a quiet close  
And maybe just in time  
We've almost lost the heart to know  
How to keep our best in mind  
We've almost lost the heart to know  
How to keep our best in mind  
  
Time has turned an angry face  
Throws a dark eye back to sea  
But what will pass for mercy now  
We'll practice unforgivingly  
As if might and will make right  
Or either one could make us free  
As if might and will make right  
Or either one could make us free  
  
Lovers laugh and cross this way  
They're weaving out into the street  
It seems we never were so young  
Or it was never quite so sweet  
But the world is always beautiful  
When it's seen in full retreat  
The worst of life looks beautiful  
As it slips away in full retreat  
  
God only knows that we can we do  
No more or less than he'll allow  
God only knows that we mean well  
God knows that we just don't know how  
But I try to be your light in love  
Pray that is enough for now  
Well I tried to be your light in love  
And I'll pray that is enough for now
