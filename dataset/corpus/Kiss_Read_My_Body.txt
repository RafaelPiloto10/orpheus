Would you want to know what I'm thinking about  
Do you wonder do I want to make you scream and shout - shout it out  
Would you like to see what's in my brain  
Does your curiosity make you insane - insane  
  
Baby you're just wastin' precious time, if you want to know what's on my mind  
  
Read my body, are the letters big enough  
Read my body, do you like the book of my love  
Read my body, turn the page, get to the good stuff, read my body  
  
Would you like to go on a moonlight ride  
Do you think you want to show me what you're like inside  
Would you like to touch, do you want to know  
How good it can get, how far it can go - ooh, let's go, let's go  
  
Baby if you're lost between the lines, open up your eyes and see the signs  
  
Read my body, are the letters big enough  
Read my body, do you like the book of my love  
Read my body, turn the page, get to the good stuff, read my body  
Baby you're just wastin' precious time, if you want to know what's on my mind  
  
Read my body, are the letters big enough  
Read my body, do you like the book of my love  
Read my body, turn the page, get to the good stuff, read my body
