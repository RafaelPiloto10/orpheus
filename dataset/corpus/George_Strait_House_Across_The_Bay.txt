Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay.
