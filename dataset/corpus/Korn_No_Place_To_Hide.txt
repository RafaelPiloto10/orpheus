Ha, ha, ha  
I see your faces and I do not understand why  
Each time I dream you're standing there right by my side  
Why do you make me? You take my pride and in my eyes  
  
You come and rape me, inside  
I have no place to run and hide  
I have no place to hide, which I like  
Some who look at the time I looked back into my life  
You want to touch me to see what's in my eyes  
Why do you make me? Remember my hate, all this shame  
  
Don't you hate me sometimes?  
I have no place to run and hide  
I have no place to hide, which I like  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run, so don't make fun of me  
I have no place to run  
  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
Which I like, I like  
I have no place to run and hide  
I have no place to hide, which I like  
I have no place to run and hide  
I have no place to hide, which I like
