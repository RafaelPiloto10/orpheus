(What is it?)  
(This is everlasting)  
Step up while I inject  
An overdose of intellect  
An overload of my vibrations  
Better yet a new sensation  
I was lost but then he found me  
Though corruption did surround me  
I was taken to a higher  
Level of earth and fire  
Where the souls of men would burn  
They were taught but did not learn  
About the righteous laws of God  
We're all just seeds among the sod  
Take any roots and tryin to grow  
Though the process may seem slow  
Please take heed to my suggestion  
Learn the answer to the question  
What is this  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
(Heavens to Mergatroid)  
(What is it?)  
Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura  
I'm speaking on my soul, for to burn would be true horror  
There's no such thing as luck, your life is in the hands of God  
So do not treat his righteous laws with blatant disregard  
In order to follow the Lord's path, here's all you must do  
Do unto each of your brothers as you'd have them do you  
This golden rule is all you need, and you will be rewarded  
The man that don't, will pay the price and believe me, you can't afford it  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
This is for the ones who war over whose God is the right one  
Can it be the Asian one, the black one or the white one?  
The answer to the question really isn't controversial  
There is only one God and his love is universal  
If you sin and crave redemption, all you need to do is ask him  
Then you will be fully prepared for a life that's everlasting  
So take heed to the words I say, grab a good book and get hip to  
The teachings of the holy Q'uran or the Bible's holy scripture  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)
