I smoke two joints in the morning  
I smoke two joint at night  
I smoke two joint in the afternoon  
It makes me feel all right  
  
I smoke two joints in time of peace  
And two in time of war  
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints,  
And then I smoke two more  
  
Daddy he once told me,  
"Son, you be hard workin' man"  
And momma she once told me,  
"Son, you do the best you can"  
Then one day I met a man,  
He came to me and said,  
"Hard work good and hard work fine,  
But first take care of head"  
  
Whoa rock me to the night  
Jah say
