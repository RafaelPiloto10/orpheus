I may not have a whole lot of money  
But I got enough girl for you and me  
I'm takin' off won't you come with me honey  
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
  
I want to show you the Riviera  
Got good tires and a good CB  
Put on some lipstick your mascara  
'Cause we're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
  
Baby I adore you  
And don't say I've never done nothin' for you  
Girl, that just ain't true  
  
Here we go....  
  
Baby I adore you  
And don't say I've never done nothin' for you  
Girl, that just ain't true  
  
We might not see no Eiffel Tower  
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet  
He can pick the wildwood flower  
Better'n anybody down in Paris, Tennessee  
  
We're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
Ooooh, la-la, baby  
Vous le vous  
Barbecue
