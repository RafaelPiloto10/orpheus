[Verse 1]  
5am Friday morning  
Thursday night far from sleep  
I'm still up and driving  
Can't go home obviously  
So I'll just change direction  
Cause they'll soon know where I live  
And I wanna live got a full tank and some chips  
It was me and a gun and a man on my back  
And I sang "Holy Holy" as he buttoned down his pants  
  
[Chorus]  
Me and a gun and aman on my back  
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yes I wore a slinky red thing  
Does that mean I should spread  
For you, your friends your father Mr Ed  
And I know what this means  
Me and Jesus a few years back  
Used to hang and he said  
"It's your choice babe, just remember  
I don't think you'll be back in three days' time so you choose well"  
  
[Bridge]  
Tell me what's right  
Is it my right to be on my stomack of Fred's Seville  
And do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet  
These things go through your head when there's a man on your back  
And you're pushed flat on your stomach  
It's not a classic Cadillac  
  
[Chorus]  
Me and a gun and aman on my back  
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this  
I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this
