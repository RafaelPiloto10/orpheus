[Chorus]  
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead  
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight  
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight  
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try  
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die  
  
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw up  
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up  
Choppin' rocks overnight  
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' ta turn into the black Frank White  
We had to grow dreads to change our description  
Two cops on the milk box missin'  
Show they toes you know they got stepped on  
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon  
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat  
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack  
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me  
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze  
Celebrate, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight  
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And still I'm havin' memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed  
As I laugh pushin' the gas when my glocks blast  
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart  
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts  
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes  
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches  
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me  
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me  
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do  
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'  
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me  
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state  
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate  
Ma main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped  
He screamed, "Thug Life" and emptied a clip  
Gots tired of runnin' from the police  
  
[Chorus]
