If you had not have fallen  
Then I would not have found you  
Angel flying too close to the ground  
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while  
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down  
  
I knew someday that you would fly away  
For love's the greatest healer to be found  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground  
  
Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound  
I'd rather see you up than see you down  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground.  
  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground.
