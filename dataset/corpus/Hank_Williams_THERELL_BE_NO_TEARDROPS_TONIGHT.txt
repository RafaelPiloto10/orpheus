I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow  
Make believe that wrong is right  
Your wedding day will be tomorrow  
But there'll be no teardrops tonight.  
  
Why, oh why should you desert me  
Are you doin' this for spite  
If you only want to hurt me  
Then there'll be no teardrops tonight.  
  
I'll believe that you still love me  
When you wear your veil of white  
But you think that you're above me  
So there'll be no teardrops tonight.  
  
Shame, oh shame for what you're doin'  
Other arms will hold you tight  
You don't care whose life you ruin  
But there'll be no teardrops tonight.
