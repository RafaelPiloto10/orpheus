Long long before I put a face on love  
The one thing I knew was that  
Like anything love can surprise you  
One kiss and you brought me a lifetime  
Do you know what that means to me  
You give me the answer to whether I bleed  
Deep in the darkest night oh, I wake you  
To tell you I know that life is so beautiful with you  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
For every minute you need me I want to need you  
In every fear life is brand new  
Deep in the darkest night oh, I wake you  
And tell you I know that life is so beautiful with you  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell
