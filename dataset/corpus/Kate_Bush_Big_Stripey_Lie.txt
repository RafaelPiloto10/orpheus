Oh big stripey lie moving  
Like a wavy line  
Coming up behind  
  
All young gentle dreams drowning  
In life's grief  
Can you hang onto me?  
  
Don't want to hurt you baby  
I only want to help you  
I could be good for you  
  
Your name is being called by sacred things  
That are not addressed nor listened to  
Sometimes they blow trumpets  
  
Only want to help you  
Never want to hurt you  
I know I could be good for you  
  
Oh my God it's a jungle in here  
You've got wild animals loose in here  
  
Want to help you  
Never hurt you  
Good for you  
  
Hey all you little waves run away  
Run away
