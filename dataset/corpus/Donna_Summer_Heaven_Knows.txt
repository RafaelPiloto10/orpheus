Baby please, please don't take your love from me  
I am yours for ever more, 'till eternity  
Silently please, listen to the words I say  
I'm not talking just for play, listen to me please  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it' s not the way it could be  
Don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows I never want to leave you  
Heaven knows I only want to please you  
Don't you know love is what I need  
  
Down inside, don't get caught with foolish pride  
Blow the other things aside, its only you and me  
Believe in us, we were always meant to be  
Me for you and you for me, 'till eternity  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows I never want to leave you  
Heaven knows I only want to please you  
Don't you know love is what I need  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave
