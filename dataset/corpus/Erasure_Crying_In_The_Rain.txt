Can you make it all right?  
Can you make it okay?  
When the top don't come out right, you move the sunlight away  
Now I feel no pain  
I do my crying in the rain  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay  
And the way I feel I keep outside then make the heart break fade away  
And the nights are long and cold, I want you here my dear to hold  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Tear it apart and it's all in the name of love  
Now I feel no pain  
I do my crying in the rain  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?
