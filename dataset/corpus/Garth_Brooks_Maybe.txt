Yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations  
Flyin' above the rest, never fallin' from the nest  
Tuesday came and went and I'm in a little situation  
Maybe it's for the best, I could live alone, I guess  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Excuse me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation  
Hung up on all my doubt, trying to sort the whole thing out  
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information  
Spinning inside my head, every word she ever said  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home
