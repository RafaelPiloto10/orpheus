Come back proud canadian's,  
To before you had TV.  
No hockey night in canada,  
There was no CBC.  
  
In 1812 madison was mad,  
He was the president you know.  
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go.  
He thought he'd invade canada,  
He thought that he was tough.  
Instead we went to washington,  
And burned down all his stuff.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
Those hilbilies from kentucky,  
Dressed in green and red.  
Left home to fight in canada,  
But they returned home dead.  
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam.  
And also the alomo and the bay of ham.  
The looser was america,  
The winner was ourselfs.  
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
In 1812 we were just sitting around,  
Minding our own business,  
Putting crops into the ground.  
We heard the soilders coming,  
And we didn't like that sound.  
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground.  
  
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming,  
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and the yankies started running,  
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.  
They ran through the snow,  
And they ran through the forest,  
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go,  
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture,  
Back to america, and gulf and mexico.  
  
So if you go to washington,  
It's building clean and nice,  
Bring a pack of matches,  
And we'll burn the white house twice.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned,  
But the americans wont admit it.  
It burned, burned, burned...  
It burned and burned and burned  
It burned, burned, burned  
I bet that made them mad.  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.
