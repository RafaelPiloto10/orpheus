I've got an achin' in my heart  
Arson on my mind  
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down  
I've got a badly broken heart  
I've bad it from the start  
You're giving me the run around  
Now if you play with fire  
It's a-sure to burn  
I've beard this all of my life  
Go on, be on your way, I've bad my say  
Well honey, I'm through with you for life  
You'll find I'm there's one in every yard  
I'm getting mighty tired  
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down  
Now don't pretend that this is the end  
'cause this time we're really through  
While you were runflin' 'round  
Burning up the town  
I was settin' a trap for you  
I've got an achin' in my heart  
Arson on my mind  
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down.
