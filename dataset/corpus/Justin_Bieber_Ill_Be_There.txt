[Verse 1]  
Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away  
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe  
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too  
I'm just tryna keep this love on track  
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Holding you close to my heart  
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach  
Damn these seats go way back  
I was thinking about way back  
When we used to say that  
I was yours, you were mine  
And we fought to pass the time  
And I realized, I realized, that we  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what (oh)  
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
