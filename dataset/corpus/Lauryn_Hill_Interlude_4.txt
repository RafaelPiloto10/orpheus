I'll tell you every single-We all have gifts, you know, and uh, like special
gifts. And there's this voice inside of us that says "don't do that," you
know, "Why you gonna get up there with that guitar? You're gonna like like a,
a hip hop folk singer. What are you, you know, what are you?..."  
(Laughter)  
And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it
now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is
what I am and I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public.
You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you
know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired
of frontin', Tired of that... And until I find a group of people that are as
passionate about it as I am, I'll just roll alone until such time, you know.
It's all good, God is faithful. y'all still get to hear it, so, you know?
'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know "You don't have the 20 piece
band, you can't do nothin'." I said, "Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'." 'Cause
somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know "Oh I, there's
somethin' that God's been tellin me to do. I can do it, too. I can do what I'm
supposed to be doin', I don't need an entourage. What do I need a crew for?"
That doesn't validate you. Okay, let's see. Mmmm...
