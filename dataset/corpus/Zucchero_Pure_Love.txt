If not tonight  
This is the strangest feeling  
Something I can't control  
Do I play the fool for you?  
  
If not tonight  
Waiting forever  
Just to see your face  
Waiting is all that I seem to do.  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
If not tonight  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent  
Sinking down into the sea  
It's not the time  
But I will wait forever  
If this is what you want  
Waiting could be the end of me  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
One day I will open your eyes  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent.  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Let it be with you tonight  
There will never be a night?  
If not tonight?  
  
Tell me when, my love.
