Lately my son, I've been confused  
Don't know what to tell you  
'Cause it's all such bad news  
Lately my son, I've been discouraged  
I look around and it fills me with worry  
What kind of world can I offer to you?  
Will it all lead  
Do we have the sense to make it through?  
I've tried to figure it out  
To have an answer, I can tell to you  
But all I can see, all I can see  
I am here for you, you are here for me  
It's an on goin' process  
I will take care of you, you will take care of me  
If we're gonna make some progress  
Lately my son, I feel ashamed  
For many things that have happened  
And are happenin' again  
Really my son, I thought we'd learned  
From what I see around me, it's still a very tough world  
But all I can hope is that you take it as a challenge  
To create something new that will take you far  
I know that you can manage  
To scatter some hope  
'Cause it's not too late to repair the damage  
The way it should be, so easy to see  
That I am here for you and you are here for me  
It's an on goin' process  
I will take care of you, you will take care of me  
If we're gonna make some progress  
Ohh  
You gotta believe, never be afraid to dream  
But follow it through  
'Cause it won't get done unless it comes from you  
You gotta make it all work  
For the ones that are comin' after you  
Though hard it may seem, you gotta believe  
I am here for you and you are here for me  
It's an on goin' process  
I will take care of you, you will take care of me  
If we're gonna make some progress  
I am here for you  
It's an on goin' process  
I will take care of you  
If we're gonna make some progress  
I am here for you and you are here for me  
On goin' process  
I will take care of you, you will take care of me  
If we're gonna make some progress
