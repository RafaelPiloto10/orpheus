Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes  
Why do I see you when this stranger passes by  
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind  
I feel you when the sun is dancing on my skin  
And when it's raining you won't find me complaining 'cause  
  
Chorus  
When I think about rain I think about singin  
When I think about singin it's a Heavenly Tune  
When I think about Heaven then I think about Angels  
When I think about Angels I think about you  
  
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss  
I like the way that they both linger on my lips  
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies  
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside  
Beautiful distraction. You make every thought a change reaction  
  
Chorus  
  
Anywhere I go  
Anything I do  
Everything around me baby makes me think of you  
  
Chorus x 3
