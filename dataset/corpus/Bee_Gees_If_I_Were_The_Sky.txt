When I wake up in the morning  
There's something on my mind  
And suddenly without warning  
Somebody's standing behind  
And it's you , babe  
And it's you , babe  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
  
You know I still think you owe me  
I dream ev'ry night that you do  
So what is it that's making me lonely  
I've known all along what it is  
And it's you , babe  
And it's you , babe  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
With you  
With you
