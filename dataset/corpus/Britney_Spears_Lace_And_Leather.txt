French fingertips,  
Red lips  
Bitch is dangerous  
Cotton candy kiss  
Can't wait for my sugar rush  
  
Can't take it no more  
I got to have more tonight  
This feeling's so strong  
I'm putting you on tonight  
  
Alright, let's go!  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby take a seat  
Eyes on me this is my show  
Your one and only pleasure  
All decked in lace and leather  
Fantasy, courtesy of me  
Baby let's go  
Watch me apply the pressure  
All decked in lace and leather  
  
Heels 6 inch  
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip  
Look but don't touch  
Unless you want to lose your innocence  
  
Can't take it no more  
I got to have more tonight  
This feelings so strong  
I'm putting you on tonight  
  
[Chorus: x2]
