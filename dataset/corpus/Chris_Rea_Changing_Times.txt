Changing times, changing rules  
Make a wise man look a fool  
Gone before no longer here  
Look out for these signs of these  
Changing rules  
Better look out  
  
You better look out  
Look out for these changing times  
Can't stop those changing times  
Changing times  
Cold hard rain  
Everything's a changing  
Nothin's going to be the same  
  
You'd better look out  
'Cause you can't stop these changing times  
Nothin's going ever to be the same  
You'd better look out  
Look out for these changing times
