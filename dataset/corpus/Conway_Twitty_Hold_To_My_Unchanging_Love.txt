When you're tempted by another who could thrill you through and through  
Think of all the love I'm giving love I'll share with only you  
  
Hold to my unchanging love hold to my unchanging love  
Don't go looking for another hold to my unchanging love  
  
There are men who long to hold you and they'll promise you the world  
Don't be fooled by all their wooing I want you to be my girl  
Baby hold to my unchanging love  
Baby won't you hold to my unchanging love
