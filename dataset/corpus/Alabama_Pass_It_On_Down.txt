We live in the land of plenty  
But many things aren't plenty anymore  
Like the water from our sink  
They say's not safe to drink  
  
You gotta go and buy it at the store  
Now we're told there's a hole in the ozone  
Look what's washing on the beach  
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas  
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's leave some blue up above us  
Let's leave some green on the ground  
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place where I live called the Canyon  
Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water, it's so pure  
And I'm gonna make sure  
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back  
They'll have to pay for all we did  
  
[Chorus: x 4]  
  
Tag:  
Leave it and pass it on down
