I'll wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
With my (pimp cup down?)  
Nothing lost nothing found  
Is the things that you do  
That makes me love you  
Turn aroud and thump thump  
That's what I want you to do  
Even when I want you  
I hope you want me too  
  
I'll wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
And know what I'ma do now  
I'ma keep you around  
I like your teeth when you smile  
And your bootys like wild  
So turn around and thump thump  
Or I jump in your trunk  
I reeli reeli want you  
I hope you want me too  
  
I'll wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone (I'm here, I'm here, I'm here)  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love
