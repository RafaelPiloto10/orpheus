Oh how you tried to cut me down to size  
Telling dirty lies to my friends  
But my own father said give her up don't bother  
The world isn't coming to an end  
(he said just) Walk like a man  
Talk like a man  
Walk like a man my son  
No woman's worth  
Crawling on the earth  
Just walk like a man my son  
Good-bye baby I don't mean maybe  
I'm gonna get along somehow  
Soon you'll be cryin on account of all your lyin  
Oh yeah just look who's laughing now  
(I'm gonna) walk like a man  
Fast as I can  
Walk like a man from you  
I'll tell the world to forget about it girl  
And walk like a man from you
