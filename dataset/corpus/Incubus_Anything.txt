I met the day  
Feeling cheaper than usual  
I guess you could say that I'm on sale  
So take what you can while you can  
Shop now intensive  
I could snap at any moment  
And I might feel more expensive  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't owe anything to you  
I don't owe anything to you  
You don't you know me half as well as you think you do  
I don't owe anything  
Anything to you  
  
I met the mirror  
The plastic hanging from my ear  
And in that moment I went unfazed  
So take what you can while you can  
Less conscious only means more gold  
I could snap at any moment and remember  
I was not born to be sold  
  
[Chorus: x2]
