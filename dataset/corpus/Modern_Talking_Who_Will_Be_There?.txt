Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The rain is getting stronger, I listen to the rain  
And I can't wait no longer, oh please come back again  
If I could live forever, baby I will live with you  
If we can't be together, baby I will die, it's true  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
Who will be there, my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when I'm alone  
Who will be there, where is my home  
Who will be there, it's so unfair, stay by my said  
  
Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The summer was oh magic, oh baby just we two  
Now times are getting tragic, and lonely without you  
Oh when my heart is crying, baby oh it cries for you  
And if our love is dying, baby I will die, it's true  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
Who will be there, my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when I'm alone  
Who will be there, where is my home  
Who will be there, it's so unfair, stay by my said  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
And when my heart cries loud  
And if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out (who will be there)  
Who will be there, my heart cries loud (who will be there)  
Baby I swear that I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when I'm alone  
Who will be there, where is my home  
Who will be there, it's so unfair, stay by my said  
  
(Who will be there), who will be there  
(Who will be there), who will be there
