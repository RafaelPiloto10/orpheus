Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Chorus:  
Is it love, is it love that I feel  
Is this the love people talk about  
Is it love, is it love that I feel  
Is this the love that we used to dream about  
Is it love...  
I'm standing alone, in a bright cold December night  
I'm counting the stars, while I wait, here for you my lady  
They say we're meant for each other  
That it's too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My body's aching for you  
Chorus  
I'm starting to walk, heading home, is it over now  
Then you're calling my name, I reach out  
Though it hurts so baby  
They say we're meant for each other  
That it's too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My body's aching for you  
Chorus  
Can someone explain why I feel  
This burning pain inside, it tears me apart  
Makes me weak but I can't resist  
Chorus
