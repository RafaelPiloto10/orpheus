I wasn't fooling around  
Everything's true that I said  
So take me seriously  
Darling, please just take me  
I wasn't fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasn't joking  
About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasn't playing around  
I'm not a kid anymore  
I'm not the clown  
That's just here to amuse you  
I wasn't fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasn't joking  
About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasn't fooling around  
It wasn't like that at all  
So take me seriously  
Darling, please just take me  
I wasn't fooling around  
I wasn't fooling around
