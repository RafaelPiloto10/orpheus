Life was a ball of alcohol  
And pills and blues and gals  
And every hung over mornin'  
Was an unheeded warnin'  
That I shared with my lost pals  
  
And the music flowed  
And my chosen road grew wider everyday  
'Til the highs got low and the will said no  
I can't go on that way  
  
Can't go that way, can't go that way  
Yes, the highs got low and the will said no  
I can?t go on that way  
  
Sugar is sweet and good prime meat  
Is so hard to come by  
Saccharine is 'round again  
But today it's do or die  
  
My baby's is home where I belong  
And this is still my day  
I am hangin' on and I am comin' on strong  
And I can't go on that way  
  
Can't go that way, can't go that way  
I'm still hangin' on and comin' on strong  
And I can't go on that way  
  
Up is down and next time around  
I ain't goin' round again  
When it comes my time, I'm gonna stop at the line  
And forget where I've been  
  
Who was it said that alive is dead  
And night to some is day  
Just let her go and let a new wind blow  
'Cause I can go on that way
