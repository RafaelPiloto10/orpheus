Rain keeps falling, keeps falling down  
Like it's never going to quit  
Trouble stalks this one horse town  
Like it can smell the fear inside of it  
Through the night the fires rage  
Mixing juices 'til they disengage  
Mouths get hungry and the hands reach out  
Is there something we should talk about  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground  
Shattered trusts and broken vows  
Can exact a heavy toll  
And in the race of heart and mind  
Sure, the loser is the soul  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground  
Higher, higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
Faithless deeds for faithless times  
All men are guilty of their brothers' crimes  
So few are chosen, there's even fewer called  
So few can ever read the writing on the wall  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Oh people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground
