Mister Moonlight  
You came to me one summer night  
And from your beam you made my dream  
And from the world you sent my girl  
And from above you sent us love  
And now she is mine, I think you're fine  
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight  
  
Mister Moonlight come again please  
Here I am on my knees begging if you please  
And the night you don't come my way  
I pray and pray more each day  
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight  
  
And the night you don't come my way  
I pray and pray more each day  
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight  
  
Mister Moonlight come again please  
Here I am on my knees begging if you please  
And the night you don't come my way  
I pray and pray more each day  
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight  
Mister Moonlight
