At last, my love has come along  
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song  
At last, the skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream that I could speak to  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill I'd never known  
You smiled, and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven, for you are mine at last.  
  
I found a dream that I could speak to,  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I had never known  
You smiled, and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last.
