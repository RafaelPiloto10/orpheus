You  
What you looking at?  
Head down  
Too late for that  
What you want  
What you get  
Know your place  
Don't ever forget  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything  
Hey you  
What you running from?  
All your hate  
What you've become  
Bet you didn't think  
It would happen to you  
All used up  
Half way through  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything
