Your precious love, that means so much  
Will it ever stop or will I just lose touch  
What I want to say, but my words just fail  
Is that I need it so I can't help myself  
Like a hungry child, I just help myself  
And when I'm all full up, I go out to play  
  
Lonely as the moors on a winter's morning  
Quiet as the sea on a good calm night  
In your tranquil shadow, I try and follow  
I hear your distant shoe clicks  
To the midnight beat  
I feel trapped in sorrow  
In this imagery  
But that's how I am and why I need you so  
  
But I don't mean to bleed you dry  
Or take you over for the rest of your life  
It's just that I need something solid in mine.  
Believe me baby!  
  
Your precious love, that means so much  
Will it ever stop or will I just lose touch  
What I want to say, but my words just fail  
I hear your distant shoe clicks  
To the midnight beat  
I feel trapped in sorrow  
In this imagery  
But that's how I am and why I need you so...
