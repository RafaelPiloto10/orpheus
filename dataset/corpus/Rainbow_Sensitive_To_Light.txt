I was feelin' rather good  
Should've touched some wood  
Here she comes again  
Reachin' out to bend my ear  
  
She's worth another look  
All the time it took  
Pleasin' to the eye  
How can I just disappear, oh  
It ain't clear, no  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh I just might, yeah  
  
I could have let her in  
Give her just a spin  
Let her think it's love  
Better rise above it all  
  
She's knockin' at the door  
Seems to want some more  
Never gets the clue  
What am I to do she'll fall  
And she might call, oh no  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh, I just know  
  
She could do me well  
I can always tell  
She's ready for the kill  
But I think that I will go, no  
  
Sure I'm gonna see  
Something just for me  
'Til it comes along  
When it's feelin' wrong I'll know  
Gotta take it slow, yeah  
  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh, I might, yeah  
  
She's a bright and blazing star  
But I just must be sensitive to light, yeah  
Sensitive to light, oh
