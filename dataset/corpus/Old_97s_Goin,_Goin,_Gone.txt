Getting' out of the house  
I'm gonna go for a ride  
'Cause I got me a five-o Ford  
And the good Lord knows I tried  
  
To make friends with you  
And everything went wrong  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
Goin' down to the tracks  
I'm gonna hide out for a while  
Gonna have me some ranch-style beans  
From a tin can hobo-style  
  
Forget your face  
If that can be done  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
And you'll find you a boyfriend  
And he won't like my cat  
And you'll try to  
Pretend that you don't want me back  
  
Right now I'm leavin'  
So you'd better say, so long  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
Gonna find me a boat  
And a brand new name  
I'm gonna find some wall-eyed  
Weak-kneed European dame  
  
She'll be my wife  
And you'll only be a song  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
And you'll find you a boyfriend  
And he won't like my cat  
And you'll try to  
Pretend that you don't want me back  
  
Right now I'm leavin'  
So you'd better say, so long  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm gone  
  
Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'  
I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm gone
