[Chorus]  
(We've got to) Sleep on it  
Everything's gonna be alright  
If we just sleep on it  
Everything's gonna be alright  
  
Tonight there will be no more quarreling  
We'll shut out the lights, close our eyes  
I don't know how this started  
I don't know why we fight  
I'll apologize for all the unkind things  
I said to you  
Why can't I see what's right for me  
Might not be right for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People are gonna think  
What they what to think  
Feel what they want to feel  
I don't wanna see you cry  
I don't wanna see you compromise  
The things that shine  
The brightest in your eyes  
Hold on to your dreams  
Hold on to them tight
