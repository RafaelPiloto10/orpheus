(talking)  
Look out man, quit tripping man, how you gone tell me  
To choose between you and the streets, don't you know  
If I leave the motherfucking streets alone  
How are we gonna get the rent paid and the  
Motherfucking bills paid, knowI'msaying  
You got to cover my eyes remember  
[Z-Ro]  
Baby stay down with me through thick and thin, and I promise it's gonna pay
off  
Though hurts you like a sailor cause baby you need to stay soft  
You took me on a ride, without no breaks to mash  
The things you do it make the average nigga hate your ass  
But I just love it when you cuss at a nigga, when it's all good  
In the bed when your finger nails clutching a nigga  
You said you'd always be there, and not to worry about a thang  
But when I started to struggle you left a nigga to hang  
What kind of shit is when you want to see your woman tonight  
On top of that there was no food, phone, water or lights  
I had a state be thought of suicide, nobody could move it  
You took the pistol from my head when I attempted to do it  
Baby I know that I be tripping sometimes  
It's just because I never owned anything that's mine  
Understand my situation and be patient and we'll make it in the end  
Want you to be the first to ride around in my benz  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
  
(Chorus)  
Forgive me baby I'm a thug  
I make all my money from selling all these drugs  
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose  
But I slowed down my hustle cause I'm digging you  
And I, won't keep on hogging you  
Even though you're the only girl I'm talking to  
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose  
But if I lose you, it's all a part of paying dues  
[Z-Ro]  
We went from good to better, better to worse then we separated  
I should of beeped you to apologize but I guess I changed  
Cause I be feeling like you wanted to end  
Don't want to be your enemy baby, but I can't be your friend  
Female associates are gone, miss, I loved you  
And treated your kid as if he was my own kid  
So if you think I was affatuated, bet one hundred see-notes  
That I show you what it is to be broke  
When I was ready to misbehave and get paid, my nigga run at me now  
Knew it was peticular car cause I got you on my mind  
Even all the days of my life I want you staying with me  
But the way it's been it don't get gravy until you laying with me  
Cause we be at eachother's thugs like we were crypts and bloods  
Always the first to say I'm sorry grab your hips and shove  
I want to kick it but I got business to handle with my crew  
Call me later when you ready to say I do  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
(Chorus)  
[Z-Ro]  
Forgive me baby I'm a thug, what happened to all the capping  
Now that I'm rich you want to greet me with kisses and hugs  
I had to stop chasing you, I chose to chase my feddy  
Now I get promenade in an escallade, and be low keyed in my cheve  
Now you looking like you want to curse  
Never put trust in the woman or a nigga, only put trust in my verse  
Cause if it is well then I'll understand  
if you ain't helping me making you could find another man  
I'll get my pen and she is number one in my state  
Got ladies looking from me head to chest then the navel  
Willing and abel to be dedicated from the heart  
Must of mistaken me for yourself that's why I cheated from the start  
Freaky in the dark, baby I bet I make you cum  
And if your nigga don't like it, I bet I'll make him run  
I bet these bitches be tripping over the way I run through em like socks  
Like them old niggas run through throw away glocks  
Should of known me is to love a thug  
(Chorus)
