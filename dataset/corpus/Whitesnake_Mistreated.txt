I've been mistreated, I've been abused.  
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused  
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind, you know I have.  
  
I've been lonely, I've been cold.  
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold  
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing, I've been losing,  
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.  
  
I've been mistreated, I've been abused.  
I've been looking for a woman, yeah, I've been confused  
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated, ooh oh.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing, losing,  
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.  
Oh oh oh, oh woman, oh woman, oh woman.  
  
I've been losing my mind.
