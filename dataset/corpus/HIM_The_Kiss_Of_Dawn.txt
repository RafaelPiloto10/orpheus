Blinded I am  
And so are you  
By shedding tears  
Confusion that separates us two  
We hold dear  
  
Just look into my eyes  
Kiss our fears goodbye  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain that you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm tired of the games  
I'm playing with you  
When you're not here  
Death frees from the fear of dying  
It's true, have no fear  
  
Let me look into your eyes  
And see death pass us by  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn
