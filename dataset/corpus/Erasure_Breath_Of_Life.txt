Never had a point of view  
'Cause my mind was always someone else's mind  
  
I never had to tell a lie  
Cause I left the choices up to them  
Don't know why but I did  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in it's love  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
I never had to call the tune  
'Cause I always drifted with the tide of the moon  
(Ah la luna, my love, my love, my love)  
  
I would go out every night  
Looking for someone to treat me right  
Not a chance (chance) not a hope (hope)  
In this world (world)  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in it's love  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
(More)  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be coming back for more (more)  
(oh yeah) (More)
