Where are the boot straps  
To lift myself up?  
Where is the well  
Where I once filled my cup?  
Where does this sorrow  
All turn into joy?  
And where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy?  
  
Where is my true love  
When the wind starts to moan?  
Is she out in the wild,  
Is she there all alone?  
Have I cast her aside  
Like an unwanted toy?  
Tell me where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy?  
  
He's goin' down the backroads  
In a cold pourin' rain  
He's a waitin' for a postcard  
In the south coast of Spain  
Postmarked from a sweetheart  
Back in ol' Illinois  
Sayin' where oh where is my sleepy eyed boy?
