I'm thinking about when I was a sailor  
Spent my time on the open seas  
When we'd stay off the coast of Jamaica  
I'd secretly steal ashore  
The natives were waiting for  
The boy with the lazy soul  
To sing with the sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Every evening I'd be gone  
Back on board by break of dawn  
  
I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica  
Pretty girls dancin' here and there  
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor  
The captain he don't know  
Where Billy he done go  
But I'm singing with native girls  
The songs of a sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Every night in Jamaica I'd sing with the lady  
And drink with the men till the morning appear  
Healthy sunshine is fresh on my face  
As the songs of the night puts the ring in my ear  
  
[Chorus:]
