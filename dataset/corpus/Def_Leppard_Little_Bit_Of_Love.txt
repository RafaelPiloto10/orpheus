I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Well in my mind  
It's easy  
To lose sight of the truth  
But in my heart  
I can't deny  
My feeling inside  
  
'Cos I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Man in the sky  
You say you are flying  
To lose sight of the world  
You wanna stay high  
Then don't deny  
Your feeling inside  
  
'Cos I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Yeahh!  
Whooo!  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh!  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Whooooo  
Has gotta come your way
