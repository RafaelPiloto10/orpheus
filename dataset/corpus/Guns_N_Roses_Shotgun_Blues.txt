I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I can't wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
  
An now you're blowin' smoke  
I think you're one big joke  
Me...I gotta lot to learn  
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn  
You say I walk a line  
Fuck they move it every time  
You walk a mile in my shoes  
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues  
You get what you pay for  
An freedom's real high priced  
An while your rippin' off children  
Somebody's fuckin' your wife  
It's never made a difference  
It's only how you survive  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I can't wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
An now you ask me why  
I said it's do or die  
I'll stick it right in your face  
And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place  
And you...you can suck my ass  
An I think it's so low class  
Me...I'm just so concerned  
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn  
Ooooh you want a confrontation  
I'll give you every fuckin' chance  
With your verbal masturbation  
Me...I just like to dance  
How's that for provocation  
I'm just makin' a stance  
An I'm tired of the frustration  
Of livin' inside of your lies  
And I'm wired on indignation  
I said somebody's got to die  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I can't stay here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
Listen motherfucker  
You're about to pay your dues  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
If you're goin' up against me  
Then you know you're gonna lose  
I know  
I know (there's ways- that we- can find)  
I know  
I know  
  
You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen  
Would believe your shit...fuckhead  
Nothin' but a fuckin' pussy
