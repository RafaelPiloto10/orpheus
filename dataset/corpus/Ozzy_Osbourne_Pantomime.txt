They feel they've raised her  
The new queen of evolution  
Her fate wont see to that  
Cause we're gonna know her later  
Grab that girl, get her home lets put her on restriction  
Last time we let her go she missed two days of school  
Lets get her back, get her back  
  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
  
Relaxed in vermin life applause takes place of feeling bad  
So you tried it  
Recalling memories of charm school pantomine turned so bad  
Dainty socialite she changed her point of view  
Now she's bad can't hide it  
I think she really like all the things that she learned.  
  
Be a good girl like  
Your suppose to be  
Dominate your fears  
Be a good girl like  
Your suppose to be  
Dominate your fears  
Good girls you should be  
I think you better know  
  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
This feels like a true fantasmasy  
It feels like you
