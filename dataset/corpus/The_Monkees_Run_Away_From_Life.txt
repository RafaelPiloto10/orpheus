Let's run away from life together  
Let me run away from life with you  
Let's run away from life together  
Leave behind the stormy weather  
  
Let's find out what fantasy can do  
Where we'll go to they can't touch us  
Life is perfect nothing more to do  
Nothing more than we'll be needin'  
  
Life is paradise in Eden  
Eatin' grapes and makin' love with you  
  
Rest unchanging, no more fights  
We won't ever even disagree  
Let's go off into the heavens  
In eternal happiness for free  
  
Nothing's wrong, no strings attached  
No reason to get crazy, never blue  
Nothin' from your noisy neighbor,  
Nothing's new, no trial, no labor  
Cross the river Jordan, hallelue  
  
Rest unchanging, no more fights  
We won't ever even disagree  
Let's go off into the heavens  
In eternal happiness for free
