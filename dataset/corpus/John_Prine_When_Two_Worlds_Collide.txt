Your world was so different from mine, don't you see  
And we couldn't be close, though we tried  
We both reached for heavens, but ours weren't the same.  
That's what happens when two worlds collide  
  
Your world was made up of things sweet and good  
My world could never fit in, I wish it could  
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh, how they've cried  
That's what happens when two worlds collide  
  
Your world was made up of things sweet and good  
My world could never fit in, I wish it could  
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh, how they've cried  
That's what happens when two worlds collide  
That's what happens when two worlds collide  
  
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses  
A blossom from and orange tree in your hair  
While the organ plays "I love you truly,"  
Just let me pretend that I am there  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking  
Those wedding bells with never ring for me  
Those wedding bells with never ring for me
