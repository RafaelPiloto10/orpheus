You and I  
You and I  
Always the same thing  
Every time, every time  
You come around  
  
Tell me now  
Tell me now  
Why I'm believing?  
Is it time,  
Is it time to take a vow?  
  
Our little hearts are crying loud  
I feel this silence coming down  
  
I hope you got what you came for  
I hope you got what you came for  
We can stand it outside  
We can stand it outside  
Go there  
On your own, yeah  
On your own yeah  
You must be out of your mind  
I hope you got what you came for  
  
I will keep  
I will keep  
Everything that I am  
Go ahead  
Go ahead  
Do what you like  
  
Guess I was  
Guess I was lost in the moment  
How to be  
How to be out of time?  
  
Our little hearts are crying loud  
I feel this silence coming down  
  
I hope you got what you came for  
I hope you got what you came for  
We can stand it outside  
Go there  
On your own, yeah  
On your own yeah  
You must be out of your mind  
I hope you got what you came for  
I guess we started something  
We just don't know how to start  
I guess we're broken hearted  
Every time we have to part  
  
Our little hearts are crying loud  
I feel this silence coming down  
  
I hope you got what you came for  
I hope you got what you came for  
We can stand it outside  
Go there  
On your own, yeah  
On your own yeah  
You must be out of your mind  
I hope you got what you came for  
  
I guess we started something  
We just don't know how to start  
I guess we're broken hearted  
Every time we have to part  
  
You and I  
You and I  
Always the same thing  
Every time, every time  
You come around
