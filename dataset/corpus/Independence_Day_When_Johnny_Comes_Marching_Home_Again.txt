When Johnny comes marching home again,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
We'll give him a hearty welcome then  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The men will cheer and the boys will shout  
The ladies they will all turn out  
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.  
  
The old church bell will peal with joy  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
To welcome home our darling boy,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The village lads and lassies say  
With roses they will strew the way,  
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.  
  
Get ready for the Jubilee,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
We'll give the hero three times three,  
Hurrah! Hurrah!  
The laurel wreath is ready now  
To place upon his loyal brow  
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.  
  
Let love and friendship on that day,  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
Their choicest pleasures then display,  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
And let each one perform some part,  
To fill with joy the warrior's heart,  
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home
