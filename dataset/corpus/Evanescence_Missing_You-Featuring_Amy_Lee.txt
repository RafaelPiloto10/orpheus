I don't want to say goodbye  
I can see the fear inside your eyes  
It's so hard to walk away  
  
I know that this feels like the end  
Life never seems to let you win  
But I'll be back someday  
  
I'm already missing you  
But I'm not even gone  
In time we'll be together again  
And it won't be long  
  
Now everything goes up and down  
And the world keeps spinning round and round  
And still you're waiting there  
  
I'll try to make it another night  
And dream of you when I close my eyes  
Cause I'll be back someday  
  
I'm already missing you  
But I'm not even gone  
In time we'll be together again  
And it won't be long  
  
Just hold it in  
Don't let it go  
You'll always live  
Inside my soul
