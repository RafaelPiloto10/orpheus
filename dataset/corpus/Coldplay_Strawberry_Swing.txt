They were sitting  
They were talking in the strawberry swing  
Every moment was so precious  
  
They were sitting  
They were talking in the strawberry swing  
Everybody was for fighting  
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing  
  
Cold, cold water  
Bring me round  
Now my feet won't touch the ground  
Cold, cold water  
What ya say?  
It's such  
It's such a perfect day  
It's such a perfect day  
  
I remember  
We were walking up to strawberry swing  
I can't wait 'til the morning  
Wouldn't wanna change a thing  
  
People moving all the time  
Inside a perfectly straight line  
Don't you wanna curve away  
It's such  
It's such a perfect day  
It's such a perfect day  
  
Now the sky could be blue  
I don't mind  
Without you it's a waste of time  
Could be blue  
  
I don't mind  
Without you it's a waste of time  
Could be blue,  
Could be grey  
Without you I'm just miles away  
  
Could be blue  
I don't mind  
Without you it's a waste of time.
