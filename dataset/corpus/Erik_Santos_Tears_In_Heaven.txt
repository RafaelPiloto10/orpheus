Would you know my name  
  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
I must be strong and carry on  
Cause I know  
I don't belong here in heaven  
  
Would you hold my hand  
If I saw you in heaven  
Could you help me stand  
If I saw you in heaven  
  
I'll find my way  
Through night and day  
Cause I know  
I just can't stay  
Here in heaven  
In my heart, I'll remember  
And forever you'll stay  
  
Time can bring you down  
Time can bend your knees  
Time can break your heart  
I keep begging please  
Begging please  
  
Would you know my name  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
Beyond the dawn  
There's peace I'm sure  
And I know there'll be no more  
Tears in heaven  
Forever I will Stay  
Till we both meet someday
