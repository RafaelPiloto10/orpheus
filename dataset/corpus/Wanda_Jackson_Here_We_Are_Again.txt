Just when I think I've forgotten you and our cheating love's at an end  
I vowed to myself I'll see you no more but here we are again  
  
That dimly cafe where I first met you slowly has turned into our secret
randezvous  
Our vows belong to others that makes our love unfair  
But I just can't seem to find a way to end our love affair  
Just when I think I've forgotten you...  
[ guitar ]  
Just when I think I've forgotten you...
