Night time in Budapest  
So many people are waiting in line  
Darkness without a glow  
What a night to be watching a Christmas show  
  
What a magical mystery feeling  
Dancing at the end of their silvery strings  
Almost human in size  
Like children with plague in their flesh  
These puppets are oh so grotesque  
  
Night time in Budapest  
The puppet theater is so dark inside  
Gas lamps light the stage  
We're watching as the curtain begins to rise  
  
What a magical mystery feeling  
Dancing at the end of their silvery strings  
Almost human in size  
Like children with plague in their flesh  
These puppets are so grotesque  
  
Here come the puppets  
There is one, two--I see three puppets waiting in the wing  
Then they start to walk in line  
And suddenly they're all on the stage  
I see the puppet master high above on the walkway  
He pulls one string and up goes a leg, down goes a head  
He pulls one more and he lets them all go  
  
No strings, none of them fall, no strings at all  
  
I take a look at the Little Drummer Boy up on the stage, oh no  
I think he looked at me, me, is he alive?  
I get a little scared as he starts to play his drum  
On the skin of his hand, I see a little cut--blood  
  
Night time in Budapest  
So many things here are not what they seem  
But we love them all  
What a night to remember forevermore  
  
What a magical mystery feeling  
Dancing at the end of their silvery strings  
Almost human in size  
Like children with plague in their flesh  
These puppets are so grotesque  
  
The show has come to an end  
The master himself is on the stage  
With his children, the curtain must fall  
And then the puppets they are gone
