I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Every one is making fun of me.  
I have no friends,  
I'm a loner,  
And what else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself,  
  
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah [x2]  
  
No one likes me,  
I'm living on the streets,  
I have no parents,  
And I've split up with my band,  
What else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself  
  
[Bridge:]  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Yeah yeah,  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling  
Feeling  
Sorry for myself  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Nothing to do,  
Nothing else to  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Nothing else to do,  
Nothing else do but,  
  
Feel Sorry For Myself
