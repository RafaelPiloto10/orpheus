Oh, there's one thing, baby  
I just don't understand  
Two old women fighting for  
Another man  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, you know it's just too much  
Oh, it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, here comes mary  
Coming over the hill  
They say she won't  
But her sister will  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, you know it's just too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, rock on  
Oh, here comes my, na, na, na  
With a buckle of gold  
Everybody says, hey  
Rock your soul  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, just too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Hey take me back now  
Baby, where I belong  
Everything, you know  
I'm doing wrong  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, just too much  
Oh, you know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, just  
Everytime I'm going out  
For my thrill  
Here comes mary  
And I get no fill  
You know it's just too much  
Oh, know it's, know it's just too much  
Oh, you know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand
