I have a choice between the bat or the belt  
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt  
Spare me confessions, it's confession you sell  
Maybe I'll fall behind, I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
  
Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?  
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell?  
Spare me the questions since you know me so well  
Someday you'll realize I get shy and I choke up!  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
What is wrong with this animal?  
I'm terrible  
I hope you never see me wind up  
  
Farewell, my sweet paramania  
Farewell, my sweet paramania  
My only promise is that I'll never tell  
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt  
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until  
I take it all back anyway.  
  
What was I supposed to say?  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
What is wrong with this animal?  
I'm terrible  
I hope you never see me wind up
