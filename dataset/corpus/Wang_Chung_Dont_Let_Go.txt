I got your letter  
I felt so scared to  
Pick up the paper knife and read within  
I read the contents  
I got what you meant  
I know its hard for you but don't give in  
Maybe, maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe, maybe its all in the past  
  
Chorus:  
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh  
(You know I'll never give up on you)  
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh  
(You know I won't give up on you)  
oo oo - oo oo oo - oo  
You know I'll never give up on you  
  
I phoned the station  
For information  
To try and get the times of trains to York  
And on the platform  
I saw your hatform  
A kind of halo in the crowd - crush talk  
  
But baby baby don't run away  
Maybe, maybe it's just today  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I saw your sad face  
You dropped your suitcase  
And I appreciate the state you're in  
You mustn't hurry  
You mustn't worry  
I know it's hard on you but don't give in  
  
Maybe, maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe, maybe its all in the past
