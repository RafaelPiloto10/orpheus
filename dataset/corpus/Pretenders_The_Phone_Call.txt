This is a mercy mission  
From a faceless messenger who don't want to see you hit  
Here's the word, listen to it  
Somebody that you used to know is back in town  
You better go  
  
This is a mercy mission  
A voice you'll never hear again from a southside call box  
Winged demons are the hardest to outfox  
The same one you lost on the run  
Gonna show you that it ain't no fun  
  
You better get out of town you're gonna get hit  
I didn't mean to get you...  
  
This is a mercy mission  
You'll find your schedule underneath the door  
All of the arrangements have been made  
Major expenses have been paid as you know  
Don't forget the last details  
Accept no parcels in the mail
