Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness every day  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I wonder this time where she's gone (Ooh ooh)  
Is she really goin' to stay (Oh yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's always gone too long  
Any time she goes away (Oh yeh, yeh)  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
That I can't leave no thing alone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone (woo-ooh)  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Is she really goin' to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
