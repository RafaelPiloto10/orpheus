Now if all my golden moments could be rolled into one,  
They would shine just like the sun for a summer day.  
And after it was over, we could have it back again.  
With credit to the editor for striking out the rain very clean.  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view.  
  
No one's gonna bring me down, no one's gonna stop me now.  
  
Now I gathered up my sorrows and I sold them all for gold,  
and I gathered up the gold and I threw it all away.  
It all went for a good time and a song, come on.  
The laughter was like music, it did float my soul along for a while.  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view.  
  
No one's gonna reach me here, no one's gonna know I'm gone.  
  
You may think I might be crazy and I guess you might be right,  
but I know the way I feel today is out of sight.  
I do not trust your senses to remember your name.  
Without corrective lenses, things are never twice the same anyway.  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view.  
  
No one's gonna bring me down, no one's gonna stop me now.  
No one's gonna reach me here, no one's gonna know I'm gone.
