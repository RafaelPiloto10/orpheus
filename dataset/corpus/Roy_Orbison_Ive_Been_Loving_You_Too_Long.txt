I've been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
You're tired and you wanna be free  
My love is growing stronger  
As you become a habit to me  
Ooh, and loving you a little too long  
I don't wanna stop right now  
Oh, with you my life has been so wonderful  
I just can't stop now  
You're tired and your love is growing cold  
My love is growing stronger  
As our affair grows old  
And I've been loving you just a little too long  
I don't wanna stop now  
Ooh, ooh, and loving you  
Loving you a little too long  
Don't wanna stop now  
Ooh, ooh, too long, long  
Don't wanna stop my loving you right now  
No, oh, I've been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
Ooh, ooh, loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
No, oh, I can't stop now, no  
Loving you a little too long  
To stop right now
