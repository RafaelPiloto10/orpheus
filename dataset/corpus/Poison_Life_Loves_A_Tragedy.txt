Of all the words that I've spoken  
And lies that I've told  
Of all the hearts left broken  
Begged for, bought, and sold  
  
Lord I'm feeling lonely  
Feel like I can't go on  
The streets have all grown cold now  
The mysteries all gone  
  
She's all gone  
She's all gone, gone, gone  
All gone now  
She's all  
  
Well I ain't getting any younger  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
She sweet has turned to sour  
I think it's time for me to fly  
  
Well my vices have turned to habits  
And my habits have turned to stone  
The lies chipped away at my smile now baby  
While the truth ate me down to the bone  
  
One more step and I swear  
I'll be over the edge  
I've gotta stop living at a pace that kills  
Before I wake up dead  
  
[Chorus]  
Good times, bad times  
How life loves a tragedy  
Heartbreaks, heartaches  
How life loves a tragedy  
  
The nights I spent in danger  
With strangers I thought were friends  
Only to wake in anger  
For some pleasure they swore they'd send  
  
I think it's time I move on  
Like a rolling stone  
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy  
It's time to sell the ones I stole  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I paid the price  
For every thrill I got  
Those thrills are all long gone baby  
But I'm still paying for them like it or not  
  
I think it's time I move on like a rolling stone  
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy  
It's time to sell the ones I stole  
  
[Chorus]
