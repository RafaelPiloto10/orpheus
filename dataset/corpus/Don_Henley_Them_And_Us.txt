One finger on the button  
one finger up his nose  
Johnny's in some cornfield  
The Early Warning Blows  
Bigger is better  
More is more  
Look up, America!  
Gonna even up the score  
Get ready boys  
Third times a charm  
Don't need no sweater  
It's gonna keep you warm  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
If forty-five minutes  
It'll all be done  
We'll all be good and crispy  
But we'll still be number one  
And if things go from bad to worse  
We can still kill them if they kill us first  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Hell-bent  
Heaven sent  
It all got started by an accident  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust
