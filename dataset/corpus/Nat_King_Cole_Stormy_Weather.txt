Don't know why  
There's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time  
  
Life is bare  
Gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor old self together  
I'm weary all the time, the time  
So weary all of the time  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time  
Keeps raining all of the time  
  
I walk around,  
Heavy-hearted and sad  
Night comes around  
And I'm still feeling bad  
Rain pourin' down  
Blinding every hope I had  
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad  
  
Love, love, love, love  
This misery will be the end of me  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time, the time  
Keeps raining all the time
