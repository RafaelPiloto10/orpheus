I wake up every morning and see your face  
Lying right beside me it fills the space  
In my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't wanna figure right how to  
And every time I lay my head down to sleep  
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat  
So loud  
I can't hear the sound  
Do you hear it?  
For you  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve  
But still somehow you keep on surprising me  
I'm yours  
I can't live without you  
Don't wanna figure right how to  
Every time I see you I feel like I  
Could be the luckiest man in the world  
Why try to fight it  
There's no need to hide it  
Because  
You know  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
Helpless  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
Feels like  
I fall apart  
Every time  
Where do I start(without you)  
I'm so helpless  
Without you  
Without you  
  
(Pitbull)  
Every time I close my eyes  
You're the first thing that runs to my mind  
Everywhere I go  
I see you  
Hear you  
Feel you  
I just wanna be near you  
And heal you  
Last thing you said is how dare you  
First thing I said is I'm sorry  
Now I'm sitting here  
Helpless  
Man  
Same old story  
  
Now she's brokenhearted  
Time heals all the wounds  
She said  
Not this time  
It's true  
Everyone plays a fool  
And that fool is me  
Because I foolishly  
Took advantage of a woman who loved me  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
Ohh yeah
