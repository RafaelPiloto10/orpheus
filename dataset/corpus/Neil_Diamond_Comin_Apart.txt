Baby, my tears I know I can hide  
But sweet, sweet baby  
It's tearing me up inside  
  
And I'm comin' apart, breakin' in pieces  
Look at my world tumblin' down  
Comin' apart, breakin' in pieces, baby  
Since you're not around  
You've won, I'm lost  
Nowhere to run to  
  
Baby please hear what I got to say  
Oh sweet, sweet baby  
Oh don't turn me away  
  
Cause I'm comin' apart  
Breakin' in pieces  
Look at my world tumblin' down  
Comin' apart, breakin' in pieces  
Baby, since you're not around  
You've won, I'm lost  
Nowhere to run to
