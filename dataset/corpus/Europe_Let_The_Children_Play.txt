My mother would tell me  
Better stay in line  
You gotta look for the magic  
If there's a way there comes a time  
  
My dad used to tell me  
You gotta work real hard  
Keep it straight and simple  
From the head, then the heart  
  
If you'd ask my brother  
I know what he'd say  
Let the children play  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need a line to get us there  
  
My sister would show me  
To land on your feet  
You gotta suffer fools  
Before you get the life and need  
  
So God would you tell me  
Is there another way?  
Let the children play  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line to get us there  
  
My mother would tell me  
Better stay in line  
You gotta look for the magic  
If there's a way there comes a time  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line to get us there
