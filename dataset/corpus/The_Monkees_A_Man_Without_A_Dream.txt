With the music of life, my soul is out of tune,  
And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,  
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,  
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims  
I got distracted with meaningless games,  
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,  
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,  
Doomed to find out things a little too late,  
And so I must play this broken man's role,  
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.  
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,  
Without a dream,  
Without a dream.
