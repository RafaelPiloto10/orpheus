Some people tell me  
The blues ain't bad,  
But, I've never know anything  
Make me feel so sad  
Running on empty, hurting to the core,  
When everything don't mean nothing any more  
  
From a distance  
Every little thing looks fine,  
But, the closer you get  
You see the make up,  
Cracked and lined  
Somewhere there's a rainbow  
With a pot of gold,  
But, by the time you get there  
It's been taken and sold  
  
So I keep saying, baby  
  
All in the name of love,  
It's all in the name of love, my friend,  
All in the name of love  
We all suffer in the end  
  
In my room  
There are no shadows in the wall,  
'Cause I closed up the window  
So no light gets in at all.  
It's a bad situation,  
With no end in sight,  
A heartache deep as the ocean  
And darker than the night  
  
So I keep saying to you, baby,  
  
All in the name of love,  
It's all in the name of love, my friend,  
All in the name of love  
We all suffer in the end  
  
With no one to lean on  
You pray to the Lord above,  
But, we keep hurting each other  
In the name of love  
  
All in the name of love  
  
With no one to lean on  
You pray to the Lord above,  
But, we keep hurting each other  
In the name of love  
  
All in the name of love,  
It's all in the name of love, my friend,  
All in the name of love  
We all suffer in the end  
  
All in the name of love,  
It's all in the name of love, my friend,  
All in the name of love  
We all suffer in the end  
  
All in the name of love
