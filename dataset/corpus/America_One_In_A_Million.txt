One night, one in a million  
Twilight, lastin' us through tomorrow  
Nothing can come between us  
That's what I want to do  
  
Today, there will be no competition  
I think today might be  
A one in a million for me  
I've seen the sun drop below my roof line  
I really think it might  
Be a one in a million delight  
All of my dreams go with you tonight  
  
We'll walk down the roads of our impatience  
And if one has to fall  
He won't be too proud to call  
Some doors I've closed just to reopen  
And then sometimes I find  
Everything wrong's turned to right  
All of my dreams go with you tonight  
  
One night, one in a million  
Twilight, lastin' us through tomorrow  
Nothing can come between us  
That's what I want for you
