Caramel-coated pseudo happy  
Call her sticky wicked  
Will she answer agin today or pray that love'll kick it?  
Kick it love, see her little baby  
Hey girl, she don't remember your name  
Kick it love, mama gettin' busy  
Got no time 4 games  
Sticky wicked  
She just got a pair of tickets to the opera in her mind  
No applause, no encore if she dies  
CHORUS  
Kick it love, visions of her childhood  
When her heart was gold  
Sticky wicked  
Tell me people what reason's good enough 2  
Die before you're old? Kick it love, covenants of promise lay before your eyes  
Stick wicked will trick you, lick you, then it kicks you aside!  
CHORUS  
People crashing in the middle of the day  
When you wake up sticky wicked don't go away  
Sticky wicked  
Pretty stick wicked  
(Scenario of a mother who can't remember her daughter's name)  
Hey little baby, what's your name?  
Oh ain't she cute?  
Mama got 2 run today  
I don't have time 4 games  
No don't worry about me, I'm alright  
I'm alright, I'm alright
