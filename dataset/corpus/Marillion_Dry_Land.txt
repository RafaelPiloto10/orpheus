In all the time that I've known you  
You've been so edgy and nervous  
I never wanted to own you  
I was aware of the danger  
Of making a bid for your favours  
You're such a natural stranger  
I made excuses and ran  
You're an island  
But I can't leave you all out at sea  
You're so violent with your silence  
You're an island  
I can't sleep  
Won't you speak to me  
I'm on dry land  
Won't you help me please  
In all the time that I've known you  
There has been something between us  
I don't hink it's my imagination  
I felt like I couldn't touch you  
But I had the feeling you'd love to  
Tell me the truth if you could do  
I made excuses and ran
