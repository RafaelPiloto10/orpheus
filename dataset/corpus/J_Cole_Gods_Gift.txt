Up up and away  
Would you trust me  
Would you love me  
Then it must be  
  
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'ma  
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder  
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under  
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cole ass summer  
You niggas so last summer  
Onto the new, on onto the new shit  
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me  
Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint  
Now how's that for persistence  
Cole World comin', call back up assistance  
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls  
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress  
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned  
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball  
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you miss me?  
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?  
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?  
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?  
Then it must be a match made in heaven  
God's Gift  
God's Gift  
God's Gift  
Motherfucker this is God's gift  
  
Pussy my passion  
Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one  
Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one  
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one  
Ever since I got on  
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on  
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up  
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up  
What type of little fuck boy hitter  
Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga  
I ain't bitter boy that's all you  
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you  
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home  
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown  
I came up, fucked the game up  
Show my momma I'll survive on my own  
  
[Chorus]
