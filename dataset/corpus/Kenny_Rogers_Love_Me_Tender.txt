Love me tender  
Love me sweet  
Never let me go  
You have made  
My life complete  
And I love you so  
  
[Chorus]  
Love me tender  
Love me true  
All my dreams fulfill  
For, my darlin', I love you  
And I always will  
  
Love me tender  
Love me long  
Take me to your heart  
For it's there that I belong  
And we'll never part  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me tender  
Love me dear  
Tell me your are mind  
I'll be your through all the years  
Till the end of time  
  
[Chorus]
