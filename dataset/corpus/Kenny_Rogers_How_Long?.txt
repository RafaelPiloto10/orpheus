How long 'till I touch you  
'till I hold you, 'till I see you again  
'cos I've been searchin' forever  
And forever, on me you can depend.  
  
I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
One that I can call my own  
Tell me if this dream of mine will come true  
Girl, I'd really like to know, I'd like to know.  
  
How long  
Before you let me know you  
Before you let me show you  
All I have in my heart.  
  
'cos you are my inspiration  
Can't you see that I need you  
Honey, I wanna start.  
  
Let me show you, girl  
How good love can be  
With someone who love you so  
Tell me what it takes to win your sweet love  
Girl, I'd really like to know  
  
'cos I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
One that I can call my own  
Tell me if this dream of mine will come true  
Girl, I'd really like to know, I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know.
