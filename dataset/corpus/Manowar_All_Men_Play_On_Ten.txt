I made A rock'n'roll  
When I tried givin' in, to make money had to turn down low  
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud, be like us  
And get A sound that's real thin  
Wear A polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get A haircut  
And buy small gear"  
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there  
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playin'  
You won't get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play, it just ain't that way  
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again  
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220, step back and let  
My fingers fly  
While I'm burning up my gear, there's A fire in your ear  
That won't stop until the day you die  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back the power rack and deck, all of my gear  
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playing  
You won't get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play, it just ain't that way  
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again  
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playing  
You won't get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play, it just ain't that way  
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again  
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
