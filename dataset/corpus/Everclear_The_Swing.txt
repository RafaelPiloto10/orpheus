Never said I was innocent  
I will burn in hell for the things I've done to you  
Never said I was anything good  
I should die from the shame from what I put you through  
  
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead  
I will take the blame for everything  
You know I just want to help you forget  
  
We are still living on broken glass  
We are still numb because it just keeps happening  
All your friends, they can kiss my ass  
They only see the simple things that they want to see  
  
Let me be the one to make the pain go away  
Shave my skin and show a brand new face  
You know I just want to know that you're ok  
  
You don't have to like it but the swing is in my hands now  
Sometimes I think  
The power is better than a hard drug  
Sometimes I think  
The power is better than anything  
Sometimes I think  
Letting go is just like giving up  
Sometimes all I think I want to do is die inside  
All I want to do is die inside  
All I ever think about is you and me falling apart  
  
Never said I was innocent  
I will burn in hell for the things I've done to you  
Never said I was anything good  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
  
Let me be the one to make the pain go away  
Shave my skin and show a brand new face  
You know I just want to know that you're ok  
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead  
I will take the blame for everything  
I just want to help you forget  
  
Sometimes I think  
Letting go is just like giving up  
Sometimes all I think about is falling apart
