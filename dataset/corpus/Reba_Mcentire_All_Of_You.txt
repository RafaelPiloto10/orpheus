I think about  
Holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
  
Clock is ticking and the wind is howling and  
I'm just staring at the candle burning  
Bottle of red that we never opened  
Your voice in my head tossing and turning  
  
The radio is playing our song  
Can't sing along, can't even listen  
I dial your number but I don't let it ring  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
I can't let go and I can't keep  
Holdin' on to nothing but I just  
Keep trying to tell myself there's  
A damn good reason but it's not  
Enough to keep me from crying  
  
I've memorized every look, every touch  
Every time you told me our hearts weren't lying  
I'm wondering now do you even know  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
I can't break free of you  
I don't know how  
Oh I'm not about  
To let go  
Of you  
I love you  
I need you now  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
All of you
