I can sing  
I can dance  
Just give me a chance  
To do my turn for you  
There's a change I'll slip  
But with stiff upper lip  
I'll sing a song for you  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
And no one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
I've shed a tear for the lying  
While everyday trying to  
Paint this smile for you  
Backflips, cartwheelings,  
Somersault feelings  
What is there left to do  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard for me,  
A jester all the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
Roll up, roll up  
Enjoy the show  
Pick me up, wind me up, put me down  
You'll see me go  
And this painted smile  
May miss for a while  
Then come back and steal your show  
I sing, I dance  
Give me a change to do my turn for you  
With backflips, cartwheelings,  
Somersault feelings  
What's there left to do  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside
