I took one look and something snapped inside,  
I said I love your eyes  
You took my heart, you took my breath away,  
I felt my temperature rise  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
Falling into somebody else's arms  
  
I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise  
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,  
you had me hypnotized  
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much  
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me  
To love and to comfort you  
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air  
I'll be there  
  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay  
  
[Chorus]
