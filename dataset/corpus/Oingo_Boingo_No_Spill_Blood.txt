(What is the law?)  
(What is the law?)  
Animals came from miles around  
So tired of walking so close toe the ground  
They needed a chance, that's what they said  
Life is better walking on two legs  
But they were in for a big surprise  
'Cause they didn't know the law!  
CHORUS  
(What is the law)  
No spill blood  
What is the law  
(No spill blood)  
(Who makes the rules)  
Someone else  
Who makes the rules  
(Someone else)  
The rules are written in the stone  
Break the rules and you get no bones  
All you get is ridicule, laughter  
And a trip to the house of pain!  
CHORUS (in reverse order)  
We walk on two legs not on four  
To walk on four legs breaks the law  
What happens when we break the law?  
What happens when the rules aren't fair?  
We all know here we go from there  
To the house of pain!  
To the house of pain!  
(What is the law)  
What is the law  
(Who makes the rules)  
Who makes the rules  
We walk on two legs not on four  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
(No spill blood)
