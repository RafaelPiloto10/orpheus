[Verse 1]  
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me outta the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go ahead and sell me out  
And I'll lay your ship there  
  
See how I leave with every piece of you  
Don't under estimate the things that I would do  
There's a fire starting in my heart in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me outta the dark  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
The keep me thinkin' that we could've had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
We should've had it a-a-a-all  
Rollin' in the de-e-ep  
You had my heart and so-o-o-oul ya had it  
And you played it to the be-e-e-eat  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you  
And I'm gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
The scars of your love  
Remind me of us  
They leave me thinkin' that we could've had it all  
The scars o-of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
We could've had it a-a-a-all  
Rollin' in the de-e-ep  
You had my heart and so-o-o-oul ya had it  
And ya played it to the de-e-e-ep  
And you played it to the be-e-e-eat  
Mmmhmmm
