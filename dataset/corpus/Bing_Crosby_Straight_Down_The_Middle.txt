Fore!  
  
Straight down the middle  
It went straight down the middle  
Then it started to hook just a wee, wee bit  
That's when my caddie lost sight of it  
That little white pellet has never been found to this day  
But it went straight down the middle like they say  
  
Whack down the fairway  
It went smack down the fairway  
Then it started to slice just a smidge off line  
It headed for two then it bounced off nine  
My caddie says long as you're still in the state you're okay  
Yes it went straight down the middle quite a ways  
  
The sun was never brighter  
The greens were never greener  
And I was never keener to play  
I heard it came down the middle  
It went zing down the middle  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
There's always the lies in the locker room  
And I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle today  
  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
Though they should charge just for listening in the locker room  
But I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle  
Where it wound up is a riddle  
But it went straight down the middle far away
