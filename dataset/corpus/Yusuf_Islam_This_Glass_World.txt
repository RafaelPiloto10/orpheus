In this glass world, we stop feeling pain,  
Going nowhere, we've got everything,  
In this glass world,  
People who live below, wish they were here, just looking in  
  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
  
In this glass world, we bathe by starlight,  
No troubles here, that's on the outside,  
In this glass world, sittin' without a cake,  
No need to move, it's way too nice up here  
  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
In this glass world
