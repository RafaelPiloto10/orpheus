History recalls how great the fall can be  
While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea  
Borne on the wings of time  
It seemed the answers were so easy to find  
"Too late," the prophets (profits) cry  
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky  
  
Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride  
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died  
And though the wound went deep  
Still he's calling us out of our sleep  
My friends, we're not alone  
He waits in silence to lead us all home  
  
So tell me that you find it hard to grow  
Well I know, I know, I know  
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow  
Well I know, I know, I know  
  
Can you hear what I'm saying  
Can you see the parts that I'm playing  
"Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie,  
Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie"  
  
So you found your solution  
What will be your last contribution?  
"Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy?  
Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy,  
Yeah!"
