I'm five years old  
It's getting cold  
I've got my big coat on  
  
I hear your laugh  
And look up smiling at you  
I run and run  
Past the pumpkin patch  
And the tractor rides  
Look now, the sky is gold  
I hug your legs  
And fall asleep on the way home  
  
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall  
But I know you're not scared of anything at all  
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I'm thirteen now  
And don't know how  
My friends could be so mean  
I come home crying  
And you hold me tight  
And grab the keys  
  
And we drive and drive  
Until we found a town far enough away  
And we talk and window shop  
'Till I forgotten all their names  
  
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school  
But I know I'm laughing  
On the car ride home with you  
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I have an excellent father  
His strength is making me stronger  
God smiles on my little brother  
Inside and out he's better than I am  
I grew up in a pretty house  
And I've got space to run and hide  
And I had the best days with you  
  
There is a video I found  
From back when I was three  
You set up a paint set in the kitchen  
And you're talking to me  
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships  
And the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart  
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world  
  
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall  
I know you were on my side  
Even when I was wrong  
And I love you for giving me your eyes  
Staying back and watching me shine  
  
And, I didn't know if you knew  
So I'm taking this chance to say  
That I had the best day with you today.
