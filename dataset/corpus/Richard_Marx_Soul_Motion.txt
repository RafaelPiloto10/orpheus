I've got the fever, poison in my veins  
My mind ain't working right  
I know the answer, the way to ease this pain  
Only got myself to fight  
I can see clearly but choose to be blind  
A slave to desire  
Holding me, scolding me, changing your mind  
You're like playing with fire  
  
[Chorus]  
I need you  
I want to stay on this soul motin' ride  
There is no danger when you're here by my side  
  
Given some distance, just a little time  
Right and wrong seems clear  
But my sense of reason is nothing but unkind  
Every time that you're near  
Over and over I say to myself  
Ooh, she's only playing  
Ten thousand reasons to find someone else  
Still I hear myself saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm out here on the edge  
And I know what's in store  
It should be over and done, just let go and run  
But I've tasted too much  
Nothing's the same anymore  
  
[Chorus]
