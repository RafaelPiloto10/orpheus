[Verse 1]  
That touch I felt was you,  
I believe it  
It felt like something you would do  
How you, you keep reminding me  
That you made me for yo, I knew,  
That there would be some days  
That cant be guaranteed to be blue,  
Its true, but then where would I be without opportunities to,  
Watch you change my broken life,  
Hear you tell me its gon' be alright now,  
See your plans come together in ways I cant even explain  
  
[Chorus]  
Together we been through hard times,  
But Jesus I'm still in love with you,  
I've had many loves in my life  
But Jesus you make me feel brand new,  
You know its hard for me to believe  
That you love me no matter what I do  
So how I live, I hope you can see  
That I'm in love with you  
  
[Verse 2]  
The morning sun was you,  
I appreciate it just what I needed to get through  
Cause you knew I had a stressful day gotta get away  
With you Jesus you you make me happy  
If I wrote down all the things you do  
The list would take forever I  
Thought it might be better  
To tell you why I smile is cause you,  
You bring no drama in my life  
It was dark but I can see the light now  
Everything is so beautiful to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Hey DJ turn it up it feels so good  
To have somebody love you and your heart won't break  
Hey DJ turn it up if you've been through love  
You're Ready now to let go of yesterday  
If you can hear me, get on up and get yourself together  
He's callin you (yessir) its all for you (yessir)  
If you don't know Jesus is so in love with you  
  
[Rap]  
You You, throw them hands up c'mon its for  
You you, get it get it don't stop its for  
You you, cant you feel it Jesus its for  
You you, party people c'mon its for

No one does me like you do  
Thats why I'm so in love with you

As long I know I'm with you I'm gon' be alright tonight  
Cause its on you  
  
[Chorus]
