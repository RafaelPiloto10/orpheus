Never thought I see the day  
Never thought I heard you say  
Baby, it's over I just can't take it  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
Only want to be with you  
  
Now you, pretending I just can't fake it  
Lying here on my own, I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying  
  
I'm only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Lost in an endless night  
Drowning in tears  
Only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Caught in the morning light  
Fighting the fears  
Walking down a country lane  
Getting cold in the rain  
  
Darling I can't stop remembering  
When I took your photograph  
You never used to want to laugh  
But I think your smile is the sweetest thing  
Lying here all on my own I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying
