Me and my baby we're just going round  
Not getting on luv, not putting it down  
We had the kind of sweet affair  
We both felt we needed  
No psychic fusion, just a steady date  
No grand illusions of the romantic fates  
She looked for her, I looked for me  
Don't know why we conceded  
'Cos we were high, now we're low  
Tell me why did we go  
Falling in luv, falling in luv  
Under pressure from family and friends  
They seem to treasure a storybook end  
One look at them I realize luv is real overrated  
'Cos we were high, now we're low  
Tell me why did we go  
Falling in luv, falling in luv
