(Olivia Newton-John)  
I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love  
Could make me feel this way  
What I can be myself  
And live the truth  
No other love has ever let me be myself  
When I'm with you my heart feels free  
To open up  
And I'm never afraid to love  
Surrendering to your sweet touch  
I can face the years if I'm with you  
No other love  
Can make me feel this sure  
That I have found a tenderness so pure  
No other love  
Has ever helped my heart feel bold  
I'm never afraid of growing old  
When I'm with you  
And I'm happy to be alone  
Believin' you are always close  
I thought that older was wiser  
But now I have to think again  
I'll spend my days of wine and roses  
Romancing a friend  
I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love could make me feel this way  
Where I can be myself  
And live the truth  
No other love has ever let me be myself  
When I'm with you my heart feels free to open up  
And I'm never afraid to love  
Surrendering to your sweet touch  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love but you
