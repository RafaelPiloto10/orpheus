It all began with the bright light  
The bright light and the noise  
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire  
  
Touching and being touched  
A million loose ends to tie up  
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock  
  
The colours stand still  
And then they move around  
Comin' in and out of focus upside down  
  
Empty winter trees  
How space feels  
Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky  
  
One fine day  
The chaos subsides  
Bleeds into awareness  
And a lifetime of surprise  
  
The beauty of your mothers eyes  
The pain when you fall  
You drink it in and marvel at it all  
But you never really figure it out  
  
You get used to it  
  
The babble of the family  
And the dumb TV  
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets  
  
Chemicals in the water  
Drugs in the food  
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system  
  
The attitude of authority  
The laws and the rules  
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school  
  
The heroes and the zeroes  
The first love of my life  
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down  
When they're choosing the sides  
  
I was never any good at it  
I was terrified most of the time  
I never got over it  
  
I got used to it  
  
Alone in the city at seventeen  
With the hollow and the lonely  
The drowning and the drowned  
I was made to feel worthless  
The wretched and the mean  
Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round  
  
Holdin' on, holdin' on  
  
The greed and the missiles  
Exploding somewhere every day  
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground  
  
The cold war's gone  
But those bastards'll find us another one  
They're here to protect you, don't you know?  
So get used to it  
Get used to it!  
  
The clash of religions  
And the loaded prayers  
Information  
The face of starvation and the state of the nation  
  
The sense that it's useless  
And the fear to try  
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us  
Living with the big lie  
  
You get used to it  
Get used to it!  
It's okay, I got used to it
