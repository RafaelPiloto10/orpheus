Well I know  
I could be just another stranger  
But to you  
I guess I'm just another fool  
And you swear  
You like to live your life in danger  
Then you hide  
Behind a wall of silly rules  
Nobody thinks the way I do  
I guess that nobody cares  
Your head's so full of things  
So set your mind free of them  
I'm breaking the rules  
Did you know?  
That in the truth there's nothing stranger  
I suppose  
You think, I think I know it all  
Nobody hears the things I say  
I guess that nobody cares  
My head's so full of things  
I set my mind free of them  
I'm breaking the rules  
Breakin' all the rules  
Can't you see they're nothing without you?  
Empty heads full of fools  
Now you see I'm breaking all the rules  
Breakin' all the rules  
Well I know  
That you would love to go to Heaven  
But you know  
That you're just too afraid to die  
And I know  
That you would love to know the answers  
But to you  
The truth is just another lie  
Nobody hears the things I say  
I guess that nobody cares  
My head's so full of things  
I set my mind free of them  
I'm breaking the rules  
Breakin' all the rules  
Can't you see they're nothing without you?  
Empty heads full of fools  
Now you see I'm breaking all the rules  
Breakin' all the rules  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Why don't you tell to them?)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now come on, now come on)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Why don't you get it on?)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now come on, now come on)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(All right)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now come on, now come on)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(All right now)  
Breakin' all the rules  
([Incomprehensible])  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now come on, now come on)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now let me tell you now)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Let's go all crazy)  
Breakin' all the rules  
(Now come on, now come on)  
Yeah!
