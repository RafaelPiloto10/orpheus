We may struggle  
We may even very well see hell from the gates  
Don't think that you are alright  
Are above making mistakes  
Said I'm gonna get on your damn nerves  
And you're gonna make me mad  
But I know we can survive all that  
'Cause this love is good could never be that bad  
  
[Chorus]  
So may you never know the way  
Way that it feels  
Feels to be lonely  
May you never know one day  
When love isn't real  
See this stuff to me is genuine only  
  
See well maybe in a perfect world  
We would get along perfectly  
But seeing how this is real life  
Sometimes we just wanna be  
And I may make you say that you wanna leave  
Never come back  
But I don't  
But I know we can survive all that  
'Cause this love is good could never be that bad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl  
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl  
But you're the only one I want in this world  
Let me sing it again  
(I ain't always gonna like you girl)  
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl  
(You ain't always gonna like me girl)  
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl  
(I love you more than anything in this world)  
But I love you more than anything in this world  
Ooh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah, yeah
