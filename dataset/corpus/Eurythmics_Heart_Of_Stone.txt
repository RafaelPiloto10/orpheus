I bought your record in nyc  
Discorama down on union square  
I must have played it a million times over  
I'd close my eyes imagine you were there  
You know  
I really dig the clothes you wear  
I only wish you could be my baby  
I want to read about it  
Do you think we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
  
Two weeks in Electric Lady Land  
Two weeks and that's all for me  
I could be lucky and get off lightly  
With a broken nose and the third degree  
She said I really dig Disco music  
And if you want to be my baby  
We'd better talk about it  
Maybe then we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind too see  
  
I want to drive East Coast to West Coast  
Turn up my radio set myself free  
Don't want to talk about it  
You and me should have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see.
