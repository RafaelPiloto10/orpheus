Don't say nothing's changed with you  
I can hear it in your sighs  
The way that you can't look me in the eyes  
It's spelling out bad news  
So don't say it's the same we two  
No I can't say I'm surprised  
'cause I could see it in your eyes  
And no you don't have to lie  
Baby you don't have to lie  
Why can't it be like yesterday  
The feelings gone  
But I just want to say that I love you know  
And I'm holding on for you  
Is that a silly thing to do  
So don't say nothing's changed with you  
Now we're running out of time  
And I've got to give up something that was mine  
Oh baby doesn't it seem cruel  
So don't say it's the same we two  
'cause we're already worlds apart  
And now the lonliness will start  
Oh boy you're breaking my heart  
Baby you're breaking my heart  
So don't say nothing's changed with you
