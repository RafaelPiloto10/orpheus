Have you ever felt the need  
To see more than you can see  
Look into uncertainty  
Reflections of treachery  
Would you leave the world behind  
Endless life is here to find  
Can I interest you in lies  
Sell your soul for all it buys  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Play with your insanity  
Shatter your reality  
Pulsing in your blood  
  
I can satisfy your greed  
For now all your debts are free  
I have all eternity  
To quench all the death I breed  
Recreate the rules of play  
From now things are done my way  
None have ever won my game  
Crucified them all in flames  
  
Have you ever danced with the devil  
His temptation ever summoned you  
Ever penned your name in blood  
Let possession slowly swallow you  
When you stand under full moonlight  
The attraction mesmerizes you  
Have you ever wondered why  
It seems that evil you're attracted to  
  
Reach out to my hand  
Step back in time's sand  
Genetic wasteland  
Far beyond death
