I will not let you go, I will not let you go, I will not let you go  
You know I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
No, I can't, I just can't let you go  
Lord knows we were born to be with each other and I ain't gonna let you go  
We're s'posed to spend our lives together and I just can't let you go  
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
No, I can't darling, I just can't let you go  
I know I love you in vain, little girl, but I still can't let you go  
I'm tied to you with chains of love, but I just can't let you go  
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
No, I can't, I just can't let you go  
(Somebody tell me)  
How can my heart withstand so much pain  
And still keep on beating and loving you in vain ?  
Because I love you and I want you and I need you more and more  
Lord, I just can't, I just can't let you go  
(Well, that is why)  
I will not, I will not let you go  
Li'l darling, I will not, no, no, I will not, I will not let you go  
Because I love you and I want you and I got to have you more and more  
No, darling, I will not, I will not let you go
