It seems I've walked along this road before  
Past dreams and quite memories  
You know I've heard some of the sweetest sounds  
From voices that carry  
And they're calling you back to my arms  
And I'm holding back the tears  
They say that the road goes on forever  
But I'm going nowhere without you  
You left aboard the run away wind  
And left me standing all alone  
You travelled far and I travelled slow  
I turned around and you'd gone  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
And so the road might go on forever  
But I'm nowhere without you  
If you give a song that I'm now singing,  
Hold on to every word,  
Don't let the times we had slip through  
If you look you'll find that I'm still waiting for you,  
'Til they sing a sad sweet Chorus and the final curtain falls  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
You know that the road might go on forever  
But I'm nowhere without you  
Nowhere without you.
