I've had my chances, too many nights  
All these broken dreams, they're just drifting away  
But I'd do it all again, just to hear, hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
Never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
  
Everyone tells me I'm a fool to myself  
But I never listen to a word that they say  
'cause I've heard it a million times before  
And I'd give everything away if you will say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever let  
Tell me that you'll never let you go  
Say you'll not leave me baby  
  
Never let  
Never ever let you go  
I will never let  
Never let you go
