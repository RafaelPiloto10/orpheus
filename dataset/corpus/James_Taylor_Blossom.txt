Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way  
Lately, I've been lonesome  
Blossom, it's been much too long a day  
Seems my dreams have frozen  
Melt my cares away  
Send the sunshine down my way whenever you call my name  
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same  
Blossom, there's any empty road behind  
Sit you down beside me  
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind  
There's a song inside me  
Take these chains away  
Now, send the sunshine down my way  
Whenever you call my name  
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same  
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way  
Lately, I've been lonesome  
Blossom, it's been much too long a day  
Seems my dreams have frozen  
Melt my cares away
