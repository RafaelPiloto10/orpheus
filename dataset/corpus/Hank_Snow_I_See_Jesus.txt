(I see Jesus standing waiting for me)  
Once a man named Steven preached about the Lord  
Folks were saved then folks were healed as they heard his word  
Satan did not like it soon he had his crowd  
And as he was tried they heard Steven cried aloud  
I see Jesus standing at the father's right end I see Jesus over in the
Promised Land  
Work is over now I'm coming to be I see Jesus standing waiting for me  
  
As the stones fell on him beating out his life  
Steven knew he'd soon be through with all toil and strife  
So much like a Master with a heart so true  
He prayed Lord forgive them for they know not what they do  
  
Through the gates of glory down the streets of gold  
March the hero on the Lord into heaven's fold  
When he met the Saviour at the great white throne  
I believed he smiled and said Steven welcome home  
  
I see Jesus...  
(I see you standing waiting for me)
