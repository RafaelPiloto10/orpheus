[Chorus]  
Don't you ever feel sad?  
Lean on me  
When times are bad  
When the day comes  
And you're down  
In a river of trouble  
And about to drown  
  
Hold on, I'm comin'  
Hold on, I'm comin'  
  
I'm on my way  
Your lover  
If you get cold, yeah  
I will be your cover  
Don't have to worry  
'Cause I'm here  
  
Hold on, I'm comin'  
Hold on, I'm comin'  
  
Reach out to me  
For satisfaction  
Call my name  
For quick reaction, baby, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold on, I'm comin'
