Let's go!  
  
It's three o'clock at the Triple Rock  
Another round of watching batty talk  
  
It's where you wanna get snowed in when you can  
Snowing outside it's ten below  
  
Is it day or night we don't care or know  
What we know is we don't want to be anywhere but here  
  
Please don't make us leave  
When in Minnesota and you've got a drinking quota  
  
I'm seeing double at the triple rock  
We're still here watching batty talk  
  
Then undress and get out the top 10  
The One question still remains  
  
How much more oran(??) can we take  
I'll let you know when the medication wears off  
  
I'm a religious drunk  
And this is where I pray  
  
We're a church of alcoholics  
Can't bring up the congregation  
  
Give us air to breathe through carbonation  
We are at the good church and your feltching on bar stools  
  
We're praying that the tabs will keep the holy water flowing  
He keeps a communion and a long night of confessions  
  
Coming home after noon seems to raise a lot of questions  
When in Minnesota and you've got a drinking quota
