Oh, he's a rebel and you may not like his looks or his style  
But he's faster than light and he can walk a miracle mile  
He'll point you out then he'll pull you in  
I guarantee he'll be your best friend  
He's a rebel and he's gonna be good anyhow  
And the boys of the group oh they just wanna drag him way down  
He's so straight ahead, he will blow your mind  
He can be strong and yet so kind  
What you see is what you get and what you get you won't regret  
'Cause he's on the line  
What you want is what he's got and what he's got, he's got a lot  
'Cause it's alright, it's alright  
Ooh he's a rebel, written up in the Lambs book of life  
And there'll be no escape 'cause the stage has been set for a while  
If he comes your way, he'll make you surrender  
His story's clear and his voice so tender  
What you see is what you get and what you get you won't regret  
'Cause he's on the line  
What you want is what he's got and what he's got, he's got a lot  
'Cause it's alright, it's alright  
If he comes your way, he'll make you surrender  
His words are clear and his love's forever  
He's a rebel 'cause he doesn't conform, that's for sure  
But society rules and it's fallin' right down to the core  
He'll love you like you've never been loved before  
He always leaves you wanting him more  
He's a rebel, you see that rebel, yeah, that's a rebel, that guy's a rebel  
He's a rebel, you see that rebel, yeah, that's a rebel, that guy's a rebel  
He's a rebel, you see that rebel, yeah, that's a rebel, that guy's a rebel
