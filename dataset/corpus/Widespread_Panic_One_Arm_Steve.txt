Well, One-Arm Steve, yeah he threw me out the door  
Said come back sometime when your picture's on the wall  
Hey now, you got to get on out, got no time to field your problems  
God damn, the repo man, been knocking on the door  
Said sonny won't you walk this line, and put your hands up on the car  
Well, he may not be a talker, but he always knows what's going on  
  
So Sister Ann, she sat my ass up on the table  
Said sit still son, 'cause this won't hurt a bit  
Hey, now she's got a wonder drug for this deaf, dumb, and blind man  
Took me to the hospital, some nurse rolled up my sleeve  
Hey Annie, break my walking stick, and work a miracle on me  
She may not be the doctor, but she always knows what's going on  
  
Well Say Hey Willy Mays, what's in your suitcase full of wonders  
Big city doctor fix me up and make me right  
He said poppin' the devil's pills, will take you straight to hell, boy  
God damn, the reaper man, he just walked through the door  
He said sonny won't you step outside and we can settle on your soul  
Willie Mays is not a toker, but he always knows what's going on  
  
Yeah, he may not be a toker, but he always knows what's going on
