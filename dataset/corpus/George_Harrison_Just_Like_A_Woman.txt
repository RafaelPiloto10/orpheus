Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Evrybody knows  
That babys got new clothes  
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls.  
She takes just like a woman  
And she makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
Queen mary, she's my friend  
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again  
Nobody has to guess  
That baby can't be blessed  
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest  
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.  
She takes just like a woman  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
It was raining from the first  
And I was dying there of thirst  
So I came in here  
And your long-time curse hurts  
But what's worse  
Is this pain in here  
I can't stay in here  
Aint it clear that  
  
That I just can't fit  
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit  
But when we meet again  
Introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
I was hungry and it was your world.  
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yeah you do and  
You make love just like a woman, yeah and  
You ache just like a woman  
But you break just like a little girl.
