The Thrill of it All  
Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift  
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift  
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry  
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die  
  
Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?  
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in Man?  
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold  
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold  
  
Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it  
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah  
Forget your problems that don't even exist  
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!  
  
So come along, you know you matter to me  
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah  
Time to stop all your messing around  
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!  
  
Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive  
Do you always have to be told, yeah  
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought  
Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!
