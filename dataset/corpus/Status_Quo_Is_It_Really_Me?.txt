Baby, the feeling that you give to me  
Maybe I'm thinking your so good to me  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
Baby, the feeling, I can't stand the joy  
Spare me some feeling if I wake up a boy  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
Baby, I'm feeling like a fire, I am  
Am I still teething or could I be a man?  
Is it? Is it?  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
I gotta get along ''cause it's a long, long ride now  
I've been away too long, I gotta get on home now  
I'm getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now, I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
  
I gotta get along ''cause it's a long, long ride now  
I've been away too long, I gotta get on home now  
I'm getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now, I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind
