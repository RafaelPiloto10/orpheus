Midnight, bright light, shining from the sky  
Circulating round the earth, trying to catch your eye  
Lowdown, showdown, trying to break away  
Stay on course, feel the force, careful what you say  
  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite  
  
Me and you, rendezvous, we've got to take the chance  
I'm paralyzed, I'm hypnotized, I'm in some kinda trance  
Hazy, crazy, this thing's lost control  
It's got the power, it's got the strength to steal away your soul  
  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite  
  
It's burning up the sky  
It's burning up the sky  
Yes it's burning, yes it's burning  
Can't you see that it's burning  
  
Can't you see that it's burning  
It's burning up the sky  
Can't you see that it's burning  
  
Midnight, bright light, shining from the sky  
Circulating round the earth, trying to catch your eye  
Lowdown, showdown, trying to break away  
Stay on course feel the force, careful what you say  
  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite
