Well, she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised through the hamburger stand, now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man, now  
And with the radio blastin' goes cruisin'  
Just as fast as she can, now  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the T-bird away  
  
Well, you knew all along that your dad  
Was gettin' wise to you, now  
(Should'na lied now, should'na lied)  
And since he took your set of keys, you've been  
Thinkin' that your fun is all through, now  
(Should'na lied now, should'na lied)  
But you can come along with me 'cause we  
Got a lot a things to do, now  
  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away  
  
Fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away  
  
Fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away
