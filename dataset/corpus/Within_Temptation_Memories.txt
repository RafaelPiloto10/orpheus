In this world you tried  
Not leaving me alone behind.  
There's no other way.  
I prayed to the gods let him stay.  
The memories ease the pain inside,  
Now I know why.  
  
All of my memories keep you near.  
In silent moments imagine you here.  
All of my memories keep you near.  
Your silent whispers, silent tears.  
  
Made me promise I'd try  
To find my way back in this life.  
I hope there is a way  
To give me a sign you're OK.  
Reminds me again it's worth it all  
So I can go on.  
  
All of my memories keep you near.  
In silent moments imagine you here.  
All of my memories keep you near.  
Your silent whispers, silent tears.  
  
Together in all these memories  
I see your smile.  
All the memories I hold dear.  
Darling, you know I will love you  
'Til the end of time.  
  
All of my memories keep you near.  
In silent moments imagine you here.  
All of my memories keep you near.  
Your silent whispers, silent tears.  
  
All of my memories
