Falling  
Help me, I'm falling  
Helplessly falling  
Falling for you  
And mountains  
There may be mountains  
The highest mountain  
Won't keep me from you, oh yeah  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I just keep...  
  
Falling  
Needing and wanting  
The only one thing  
That I want is you, oh yeah  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever, forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
I fall for you
