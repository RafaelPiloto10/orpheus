You can't lease my love x9  
Oh, this was just an empty space  
That both we tried to live  
With windows and a can of paint  
And we began to build  
  
In spite of that  
(Try to build it up x3)  
In spite of this  
(Try to build it up x3)  
  
I have felt such an imbalance  
Loved my way around it  
And everyone around believed  
That one of us was in it for the profit  
(For the profit, for the profit)  
Just for the profit  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me  
Break from me  
Break away from me  
You tried to lease my love  
Lease my love, lease my love  
But you can't cheat my love  
Go on and lease my love  
  
Lease my love, lease my love  
You can't cheat my love  
I knew this day will come,  
It came so very quick  
I knew that once we fell apart  
No rule will ever stick  
And we would fold the profit  
(Fold the profit x5)  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me
