Show me a heart that's got no passion  
I'll show you a heart that's got no life  
Show me a man that doesn't give his heart  
I'll show you man that tells you lies  
Oh you can try to run, but there's nowhere to hide  
Love is stronger than your lies  
Oh and oh, you can deny it all you want  
But love will win, it's just a matter of time  
  
You know you can't run from love  
You know, you know  
You know you can't run  
Ain't nowhere to hide  
You know, you can't run you know  
You know, you know  
You know you can't run  
Love is stronger than your lies  
  
Show me a heart that's not committed  
I'll show you a man that doesn't try  
Show me a heart that doesn't die for love  
I'll show you an empty man inside  
Oh you can run, but you won't find no place to hide  
Love don't want your heart to die  
Oh and oh, you can deny love all you want  
But love is strong and won't be denied
