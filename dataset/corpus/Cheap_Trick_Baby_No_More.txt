Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
'Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Then one day I hear you say hey  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
  
You buy a nickel you drop a dime  
Too much of nothin' every single time  
It's no surprise I've heard it all before  
I don't want to be your baby no more  
  
Don't want to be your slave no more  
I'll be last dog at your door  
'Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Don't want to be your baby no more no more no more  
  
Hidin' in the corner shoot what's goin' on  
Trouble down on Main Street can't get to a phone  
Problem after problem don't know what's the score  
I don't want to be your baby no more  
  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
No more no more no more no more no more no more
