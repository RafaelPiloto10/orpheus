Adam was as happy as a man can be  
Till he started messin with an old apple tree  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman, she'll do it every time  
  
You can buy a woman clothes give her money on the side  
No matter what you do, she ain't never satisfied  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman, she'll do it every time
