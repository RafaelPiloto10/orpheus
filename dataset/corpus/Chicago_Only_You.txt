Hold me forever  
Whisper the words I've waited so long to hear  
Love's sweet surrender  
Steals an embrace and kisses away the tears  
  
Lookin' back down the road of love  
We can still feel the heartache  
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love  
Hold us together  
  
[Chorus]  
Only you  
You've got control  
Only you  
You've got the key to my heart  
Only you  
You've got control  
Need your love, take me forever  
  
Sad empty faces  
Faded away when I fell in love with you  
True love erases  
Fear and the doubt not knowing we'd see things through  
  
So in  
In a world of illusion  
We fell in love until the end of time  
True love, forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lookin' back down the road of love  
We can still feel the heartache  
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love  
Hold us together  
  
[Chorus]
