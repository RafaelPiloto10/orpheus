I met you just tonight  
But I keep wonderin why  
It seem's I've always known you all my life  
I've held you only once  
But I keep wonderin why  
It seem's I've held you forever  
  
Can it be true  
Could I be wrong  
That somewhere in my past  
I fell in love with you  
  
Can it be true  
Could I be wrong  
That somewhere in my past  
There was also me and you  
  
I kissed you only once  
But I keep wonderin why  
It seem's I've kissed your lips so many times  
I know your only now  
But I keep wonderin why  
It seem's I've known you forever  
  
Oh yeah  
Ah-ha  
  
I love you only now  
But I keep wonderin why  
It seems I've loved you forever  
  
Somewhere...  
There was you and i...  
Somewhere...
