I, hate the rain and sunny weather,  
And I, hate the beach and mountains too  
(And) I don't like a thing about the city, no, no  
And I, I, I, hate the country side too!  
  
And I, hate everything about you!  
Everything about you!  
  
I don't like a thing about your mother,  
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too,  
I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no  
'Cause I, I, I, think sex is overrated too.  
  
And I, get sick when I'm around,  
I, can't stand to be around  
I, hate everything about you!  
Everything about you, everything about you,  
Everything about you  
  
Some say I got a bad attitude,  
But that don't change the way I feel about you,  
If you think all this might be bringing me down,  
Look again cause I ain't wearin' no frown!  
  
I don't really care about your sister  
Forget the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her  
One thing that I did to your lady  
Put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe  
I know you know everybody knows  
The way it comes, the way it goes  
You think it's sad well that's too bad  
'Cause I'm havin' a ball and never cared a thing about  
You  
  
Everything about you, everything about you  
I get sick when I'm around  
I can't stand to be around  
I hate everything about you
