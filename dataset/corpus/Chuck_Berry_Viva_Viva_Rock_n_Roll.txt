Rock it, g'on jerk it, child, work it  
Rock it, g'on take it, child, shake it  
Rock it, singing the song  
Viva, viva, rockin' along  
  
Grandma and Grandpa did the Charleston Rug  
Aunt Mary and Uncle Joe, they did the Jitterbug  
My sister used to do the Twist and Shout  
But I'm with the Go-Go, I'm workin' out  
  
Rock on, g'on jerk it, child, work it  
Rock on, go 'head and shake it  
I can take it  
Rock on, oh, my soul  
Viva, viva, Rock and Roll  
Rock and Roll  
  
My mother had my sister learning Bach and Strauss  
For years it was the only music in our house  
But I got my guitar and I rearranged Bach  
And came up with some good old folk and country rock  
  
Rock on, go 'head and jerk it, child, work it  
Rock on, go 'head and take it  
I can shake it  
Rock on, oh, my soul  
Viva, viva, Rock and Roll
