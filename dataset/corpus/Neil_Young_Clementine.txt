In a cavern, in a canyon,  
Excavating for a mine  
Dwelt a miner forty niner,  
And his daughter Clementine  
  
Light she was and like a fairy,  
And her shoes were number nine,  
Herring boxes, without topses,  
Sandals were for Clementine.  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
  
Drove she ducklings to the water  
Every morn just at nine,  
Hit her foot against a splinter,  
Fell into the foaming brine.  
  
Ruby lips above the water,  
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,  
But, alas, I was no swimmer,  
So I lost my Clementine.  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
  
And the minor forty niner  
Soon began to peak and pine  
Thought he oughta join his daughter  
Now he's left with Clementine  
  
In my dreams she still upon me  
Broken garments soaked in brine  
Though in life I used to hug her,  
In death I draw the line  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
(Oh my darling, oh my darling)  
  
How I missed her! How I missed her,  
How I missed my Clementine,  
So I kissed her little sister,  
And I forgot my Clementine.  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
(Oh my darling, oh my darling)  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
You are lost and gone, Clementine!  
Clementine  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
(Oh my darling, oh my darling)  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
You are lost and gone, Clementine!  
  
Clementine!
