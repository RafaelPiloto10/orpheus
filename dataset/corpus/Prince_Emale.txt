Ooh ah ooh  
The emale left so clearly upon a computer screen  
Read like a threat that crept into her like a sex machine  
Wanted, Any woman who's first name begins with a "Z"  
From the sound of the keys, a pawn makes a move  
Her reply brings on the groove

He couldn't wait 2 tell her till after he got the nella  
Her love would only even the score  
It seemed her darling fella  
He stole a hell of a lot of bucks from the corner store  
The declaration of war that followed  
She never believed, oh  
  
In the darkest corners where widows mourn  
That's where he whispered her name  
He said, "We can do it here, my dear  
But I fear your tears will fall like rain"  
They fall like  
  
"Because I must tell you (Tell U)  
While I'm deep in your smell  
You got the man I want to inflict with pain  
I'm running a game with my paper  
I'm turning the boy to vapor  
Now I want to do the same to you  
If you don't tattoo my name upon your train"
