Dream by night  
Wish by day  
Love begins this way.  
Loving starts  
When open hearts  
Touch, and stay.  
Sleep for now  
Dreaming's how  
Lover's lives are planned.  
Future songs  
And flying dreams,  
Hand, in hand.  
  
Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts, could soar.  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove, once more.  
That love is the key....  
Love is the key.  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove.  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love.  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams,  
To bring you home to me....

Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts, could soar.  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove, once more.  
That love is the key....  
Love is the key.  
  
  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove.  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love.  
Ever strong  
Our future song,  
To sing it must be free.  
  
  
Ev'ry part  
Is from the heart,  
And love is still the key.  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
To bring you home  
To me..
