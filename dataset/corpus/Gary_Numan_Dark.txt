I've been waiting here  
Waiting for faith  
And the word to fall.  
Now the darkness comes  
And I'll pray for  
The end of us all.  
  
Don't let the dark into me  
We killed the angels that warned us of you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We raised the tower of Babel for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We let the children build temples for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
Don't let the vengeance of Heaven be you  
  
So pray to me, I'm the Lord's new disease,  
Look down into the face of God.  
Bow down and cry, I'm the black Messiah,  
The one true divinity.  
Kneel before my altar and drink the wine of slaughter,  
Who said I'd save anyone?  
So bleed for me, I need hostility  
To lead the faithful and the blind.  
  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the poison that feeds life to you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the demon that waits inside you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the ghost that reminds death of you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the darkness that crawls into you
