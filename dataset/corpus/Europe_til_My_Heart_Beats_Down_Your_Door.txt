Hey you should know by now  
I'm gonna take you down  
Can't keep me out forever  
'Cause now I'm back around  
Put your best defense  
I've made up my mind  
I ain't like the others  
I'm gonna make you mine  
I'm gonna keep on knockin'  
Knockin' like before  
'Til my heart beats down your door  
I'm gonna keep on comin'  
Comin' back for more  
'Til my heart  
'Til my heart beats down your door  
Baby you know you love me  
So why do you pretend  
When I could make you happy  
If you just let me in  
Well I remember better days  
With you by my side  
I'll keep you warm forever  
And if it takes all night
