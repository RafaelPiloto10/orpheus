Before I was born, late one night,  
My papa said everything's alright  
The doctor paid when Ma lay down  
With her stomach bouncing all around  
Cause the beebop stork was about to arrive  
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive  
  
I could barely walk when I milked a cow  
When I was three I pushed a plow  
While chopping wood I moved my legs  
I started dancing when I gathered eggs  
The townfolk clapped, I was only five  
He'll out dance 'em all, he's born to hand-jive  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - everybody  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive, baby  
Born to hand-jive, baby, -oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive, baby, -oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah,  
Born to hand-jive, oh yeah!
