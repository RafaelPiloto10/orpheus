[Chorus:]  
They say the sun shines for all  
But-a yin some people world, it never shine at all  
They say love is a stream that will find its course  
I mean, some-a people think life is a dream  
So they making matters worse  
  
But no matter what the crisis is  
No matter what the crisis is  
Doing it, doing it, doing your thing  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
Giving it, giving it, giving it, giving it  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
  
So, so, so much have been said, so little (been done) been done  
They still killing, killing the people  
And they, and they having (havin' their fun) havin'-a, havin'-a lots of fun  
Killing the people, oo-yoo! (having fun) having their fun  
They just want to be the leader  
In the house of the rising sun  
  
But no matter what the crisis is  
Oh, no, oh, no no - no what the crisis is  
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No matter what the crisis is  
No matter what the crisis is  
Do it: live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
His mercies endureth for ever, yeah  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
Oh, children, come on, and give Jah  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)  
Children, come on, and give Jah  
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
