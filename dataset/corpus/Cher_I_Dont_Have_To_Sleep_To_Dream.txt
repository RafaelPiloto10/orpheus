I gave up the fight for love, whoa oh oh  
Walked away to calm for gloves  
No more wishing on a star  
Waiting for someone, whoa  
What if no one ever comes  
  
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself  
Oh, I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream to me  
  
There's a cure for bleeding hearts, whoa  
Think you showed me where to start  
Every time I lose my grip  
You keep me hangin' on, whoa oh oh  
You remind that I'm strong  
  
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself  
Oh, I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream to me  
  
You're a dream  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream, dream  
You're a dream to me
