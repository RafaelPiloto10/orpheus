You've got style  
That's what all the girls say  
Satin sheets  
And luxuries so fine  
All your suits are custom made in London  
I've got something that you'll really like  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Feel the silky touch of my caresses  
They will keep you looking so brand new  
Let me cover you with velvet kisses  
I'll create a look that's made for you
