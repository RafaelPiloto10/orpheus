I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town  
I heard about that story going round round  
All I got's a book of love with pages worn clean through  
A circle of gold and one bleeding tattoo  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
This town's a secret shared and shattered in a sad song  
Just a Torn and tattered pieces of a love gone wrong  
Hearts of stone and eyes gone deep blue  
Only ours is filled two by two  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
Summer storm blue and soft and cool  
On this slinky town streets where the love ruled  
Now it's just a misty sidewalk with the rain drifting through  
Lipstick case and one lonely red shoe  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town
