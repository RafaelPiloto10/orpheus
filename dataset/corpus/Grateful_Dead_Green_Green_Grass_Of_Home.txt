The old home town looks the same as I step off the train  
Meeting every train in my mind's eye till the man in mail came  
Hair like gold, lips like cherry  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Green, green grass of home, green green grass of home.  
Only dream I know of is to be found hair like gold, lips like a cherry  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
They'll all come to greet me, on the steps of my sweet dream  
It's good I dreamt the green, green grass of home  
I wait and look around me at the broken walls that surround me  
And out here I was on the ground.  
There's a garden in the path of progress unharmed through winter's day break  
Then I'll touch the green, green grass of home  
They'll all come to greet me from the chains of the old dark hollow  
The green, green grass of home  
They'll all come to greet me on the steps, my sweet dream
