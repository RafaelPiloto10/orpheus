Lazybones  
You know I am gettin' tired doing all the work my self  
Man you ain't doin' all the work  
I just can't seem to get the help around here  
Oh Johny don't give me that man  
Can't you hear me  
I hear you baba  
No, I guess not  
  
Lazybones, sleeping in the sun  
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?  
Never get your day's work done  
Sleeping in the new day's sun  
  
Nah, that's your side of the story Johny  
Tell me yours  
I'm about to tell you mine  
  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the shade  
How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made?  
You'll never get your cornmeal made  
Just sleepin' in the evenin' shade  
  
When 'taters need spraying I bet you keep praying  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you go fishin', I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab your line Oh no  
  
Lazybones, loafing through the day  
How you 'spect to get a dime that way?  
Never make a dime that way ha  
Never heard a word I say  
  
When 'taters need spraying I bet you keep praying  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you go fishin', I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab your line  
  
Lazybones, loafing through the day  
How you 'spect to make a dime that way? Well looky here  
Never make a dime that way  
Never heard a word I say  
  
Man u ain't workin  
I don't get a chance to go fishin' I have to do all the work  
Ah you think so huh  
I know so  
I ain't seen no fish  
They don't bit cause you still sleepin'  
That's cause you set my alarm clock 4 hours later just so you can brag about
workin'  
I don't even get a nibble  
Cause u ain't usin' the right bait man
