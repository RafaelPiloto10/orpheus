[Chorus:]  
Help!, Help!  
Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know I need someone  
Help!, Help!  
Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know I need someone  
Help!, Help!  
  
So sick need a doc, yes  
A creature, monster like the lockness  
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death  
I just tell the clock give me a sec  
In the middle of the war where my enemy at  
I'm running this shit like Eric B enemy back  
Cause everytime I hit a track I'm like an energy pack  
The instruments are crying out "where the sympathy at"  
I attack before you begin to react  
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at  
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag  
It's Weezy baby with this hustle until infinity, ya  
Like somebody let the dog out the kinnle and ran  
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man  
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band  
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me  
I need...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Help!, Help!  
Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know I need someone  
Help!, Help!  
Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know I need someone  
Help!, Help!
