T-are-Y  
Oh baby we can fight like dogs we can fight like cats  
A dirty laundry needs a laundry man  
Maybe the king and the queen should lay off the caffeine  
Baby breathe before you react  
  
Sometimes we do forget to behave  
And we regret what we say  
Cause words are too weapons  
If we don't choose'em carefully  
Ladies and gentlemen this is instrumental  
If life's to be a bed of roses  
  
I know I gave you everything you like  
Because you still give me butterflies  
  
If we just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
Then the world would be a better place for you and I  
If we just live our lives  
Putting our differences aside  
Oh that would be so beautiful to me  
  
Are we just dangling in the middle of a galaxy  
Well I'm stoked on gravity  
To be stuck with you like flowers on the dew drops  
Now let it in my direction  
My direction is up when everybody's down  
Cause I don't mind being anybody's clown  
I love a little lift cause I'm an optimistic  
In an altruistic way  
  
Cause basically this place is needing instruments of harmony  
  
Spreading my philosophy of love and inspiration  
Oh these words I speak I commit to like a crime  
With a rhythm I deliver I'm giving them a picture  
Of the reasons why  
  
We should just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
So the world could be a better place for you and I  
If we just live our lives  
Putting our differences aside  
Oh that would be so beautiful to me  
  
Well it wouldn't cost a penny but could save so many lonely lives  
From teary eyes  
If we just try try try  
To open up a can of understanding open up your heart  
I'm just planting seeds  
Cause I believe  
  
We could just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
So the world would be a better place for you and I  
If we just live our lives  
Putting our differences aside  
Oh that would be so beautiful to me  
  
If we could try, just to be nice  
That could be so beautiful to me  
I believe,  
Oh that could be so beautiful to me
