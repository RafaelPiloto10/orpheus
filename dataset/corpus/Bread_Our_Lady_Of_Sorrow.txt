She's fallen from grace  
Somewhere in space  
The twilight has come and there is no tomorrow  
And night after day  
She's driftin' away  
And time is run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady don't you cry  
This time you'll stay high  
Lately when I've seen her  
She would smile as if to say  
That the worst was over  
And there'd soon be brighter days  
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'  
She goes to the door  
And ask just once more  
She gives everything she could beg, steal or borrow  
And each time is her last  
But time moves too fast  
And time has run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady don't you frown  
This time you won't come down  
Just today I watched them as  
They carried her away  
And I can only hope that she  
Has found a brighter day  
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'  
Had there been someone near to care what then?
