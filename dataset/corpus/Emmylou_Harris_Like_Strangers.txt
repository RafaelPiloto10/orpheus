Like Strangers, that's what we are  
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far  
Like Strangers, how can it be  
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly  
  
I love you, truly I do  
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too  
Let's forget that we've been angry  
Let's be lovers like before  
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
