Meth on deck man, on deck  
For e'rything routine right here  
Routine, Gambino, that's that shit  
Y'all thought it was over,  
  
Yeah, yo  
I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp, bowl of cereal  
Cartoons is on, my favorite shit is The Smurfs  
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt,  
cause by this time I done seen life,  
and figured the amount that it's worth  
It's the first, cops is slippin' for work  
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweatin' like a hooker in church  
This old woman on her way to the church,  
she said the neighborhood's fucked up,  
and we the ones that's makin' it worse  
Now that's fucked up!  
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up  
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us  
They tell me only God can judge us  
But they ain't ever met Judge Kufner  
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench  
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent  
But that's possession with intent  
Player, I ain't stressin', I'm a pimp  
My bitches love the cocktail dressin' with the shrimp  
  
[Chorus]  
(Killa Hill!) 'Cause we do it like how we do it  
This is big truck style shit, diesel fluid  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown, Park Hill, we just doing our thang  
  
C'mon, yeah! You fools don't have a clue, do you?  
Moving them ki's crucial, troopin' like Isuzu  
Nigga your weed doo doo, we burn that Cali kush  
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took  
Hurtin' the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot  
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books  
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out  
Con Ed status like Fab nigga, it's "Lights Out"  
What your life 'bout? Nigga my life plush  
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks  
Us Billy Boys hold toys cause they don't like us  
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffin' that white stuff  
Moving with the semi, eggplant pennies  
Hoppin' out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy  
Never been a sloucher dog, cause I'm an alpha-  
Male got that product on sale redeem your voucher  
Leader of the gang, I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa  
Little Rascals, with no hassle, I will out ya  
Sincerely doubt ya, and I will house ya  
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scalper  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time pick up the mic, I put work down  
Cops don't like me cause I live in the murder town  
My high school homies sold crack, through songs  
You can't get right through the team like two wrongs  
Mad criminal minded cream motherfuckers  
Type of subliminal rhymes scheme mothafuckers  
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch  
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch  
Killa Bees wild like C-74  
New York bitch, adolescents at war  
Fuck the government, yo they made us this way  
You a fagot, listenin' to what that chick say  
Escape route, gotta be free like furlough  
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know  
Hardcore, move with or without Clan  
Diss me in the cab and they murked your man  
I'm a general, don with the crazy hype game  
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game  
Killa Hill son, they don't like where I live at  
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back  
Real talk, hard jeans and hard dick  
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage  
Nigga feel me, or nigga feel that blast  
ATF bitch, just guns and cash  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Killa Hill!) 'Cause we do it like how we do it  
Trife, Meth and Cap yo, nothin' to it  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown, Park Hill, we just doing our thang  
  
(Straight up, Wu-Tang killa bees)  
The best that ever do it  
One-oh-three-oh-four, you know how we do  
Legendary Weapons  
Come in our section, get a blessing  
Cause we don't play
