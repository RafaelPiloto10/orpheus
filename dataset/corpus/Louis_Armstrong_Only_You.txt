Only you  
Can make this world seem right  
Only you  
Can make the darkness bright  
Only you and you alone  
Can thrill me like you do  
And fill my heart with love for only you  
Baby, only you  
Can make this change in me  
For it's true  
You're my destiny  
And when you hold my hand, I understand  
The magic that you do  
You're my dream come true  
My one and only you  
  
Oh, only you  
Can make this change in me  
Baby, it's so true  
You are my destiny  
When you hold my hand, I understand  
The magic that you do  
Baby, you're my dream come true and my one and only you
