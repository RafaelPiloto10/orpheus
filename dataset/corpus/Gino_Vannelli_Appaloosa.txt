Appaloosa, runnin' wild in the dead of the night  
Appaloosa, you're the message of love and light  
  
Apparitions, they grow wild in the plains of my mind  
I get visions of the mountain that I must climb  
  
Freedom ain't no illusion  
A truth no money can buy  
With your sweet absolution  
I will follow my star  
For the rest of my life  
It goes on and on  
  
Appaloosa, runnin' high in the heavens above  
Appaloosa, you're the angel of God I love  
  
Freedom ain't no deception  
A truth no man can deny  
With your love and direction  
I will follow my star  
For the rest of my life  
It goes on and on  
  
Appaloosa, Appaloosa, Appaloosa, Appaloosa  
Appaloosa, runnin' wild in the wake of the dawn  
Appaloosa, you're the spirit that turns me on  
  
Appaloosa, Appaloosa, Appaloosa, Appaloosa
