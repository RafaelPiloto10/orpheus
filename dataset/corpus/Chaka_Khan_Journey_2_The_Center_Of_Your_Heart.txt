I know you've been hurt before  
I can see it in your eyes  
And if you just shut the door  
I would not be surprised  
Even though I know you've heard it  
These words I'm tryin' to say  
I think the others only flirted  
With the true meaning of always  
Well, you can say what you wanna  
But I ain't gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
I see the candle through your window  
It burns there every night  
The shadow leaves an innuendo  
Of no one holdin' you right  
Many nights I've dreamt you near me  
But awakened to you gone  
I know one day you'll hear me  
I don't care how long  
Well, you can say what you wanna  
But I ain't gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
I've waited a lifetime, baby  
Just to know your name  
We've done everything in our minds  
Let's stop the game, let's stop it  
Even though I know  
You've heard these words I'm tryin' to say  
Somehow I think these others  
They only flirted with the true meaning of always
