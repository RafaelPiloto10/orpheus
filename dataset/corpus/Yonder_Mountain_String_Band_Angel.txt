If ever I need you dear  
I find your love is gone  
Sign on the dotted line  
And try to take it home  
  
I left my lamp a-burning  
I left the front door open wide  
No sleep come the morning  
Wore it out with the tears I cried  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you gonna be my angel?  
The Devil's never gonna let me save my poor soul  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Shovel that shines like silver  
Digs a hole in the ground  
The gold ring that I gave you  
I found it laying 'round  
  
The hole ate up my mind  
The hole ate up my heart  
Your name's still on my lips  
When I whisper in the dark  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x4]
