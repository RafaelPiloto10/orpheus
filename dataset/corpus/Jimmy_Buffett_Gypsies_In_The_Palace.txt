So long Boss, knock 'em dead, don't worry 'bout a thing  
Wish that we could come along, we'd love to hear you sing  
The limo's here, your bags are packed, the list is by the phone,  
Me and Snake will watch your place and treat it like our own  
  
Look at all this liquor  
Look at all this food  
It's only gonna go to waste  
We're not really being rude  
But the good stuff's in his closet, I swear he wouldn't mind  
Hell, we''ll just shoot the lock off, I do it all the time  
  
We're gypsies in the palace, he's left us here alone  
The order of the sleepless knights will now assume the throne  
We ain't got no money, we ain't got no right  
But we're gypsies in the palace, we got it all tonight  
  
There's damsels in distress out there and we got all this beer  
We'll free them from their condos and bring them over here  
We'll show them his Gold Records  
We'll play his music loud  
We'll party just like Bubba does  
We'll do the old man proud  
  
We're gypsies in the palace, there ain't no wrong or right  
We're gypsies in the palace, and we're going wild tonight.  
  
He's the greatest guy to work for, man, he's really cool  
Hey Snake, this party's getting dull, throw someone in the pool  
Hey, let's all take our clothes off and form a conga line  
Watch out for that broken glass, hey Snake, we need more wine  
  
We're gypsies in the palace, there ain't no wrong or right  
We're gypsies in the palace and we're raising hell tonight, hey  
  
Oh, hi there Boss, what's goin' on?  
You say you're coming when?  
I'll send Snake to pick you tomorrow night at ten, okay  
  
Everybody out of here, the show is closing down  
We've got to find someone to clean this up,  
He's coming back to town  
  
Hi there boss, we waxed your car, we raked and mowed  
your lawn  
We couldn't find enough to do in the short time you  
were gone  
  
Man it sure is peaceful here, you really got it all  
If you ever hit the road again, give me and Snake  
a call  
  
We're gypsies in the palace, he's left us here alone  
The order of the Sleepless Knights will now assume  
the throne  
We ain't got no money, we ain't got no right  
But we're gypsies in the palace, we got it all tonight  
  
Hello?  
Hey, Jimmy, it's Glenn  
Glenn, How ya doing?  
Fine man, I'm going on the road, do you know anyone who  
could house sit for me?  
I got these two great guys that look after my place man,  
they're the best.
