The day is ended little drummer boy  
Lights out was sounded long ago  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And dream of the ones that you love so  
  
Reveille will sound in the morning  
Once more on parade you will go  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And say goodnight to all your friends and foes.  
  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And say goodnight to all your friends and foes.
