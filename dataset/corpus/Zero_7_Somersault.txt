You're the prince to my ballerina  
You'll feed all the people's parking meters  
You encourage the eating of ice cream  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You talk to loners  
You ask 'how's your week?'  
You give love to all  
And give love to me  
You're obsessed with hiding  
The sticks and stones  
And feel the unknown  
You feel like home  
You feel like home  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh, did you know you brought me home  
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound  
Can you save me  
  
You're the wars in my summer's breeze  
You're the ivories in my ebony key  
You would share your last jelly bean  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh, did you know you brought me home  
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound  
You save me  
  
You put my feet (back on the ground)  
Oh, did you know you brought me (home)  
Yeah you were sweet and you were (sound)  
See I have tried  
You still bring me around 'n around 'n around  
  
'n around 'n around 'n around  
Yeah yeah oh oh  
You brought me around  
Yeah yeah oh oh
