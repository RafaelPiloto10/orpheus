Excuse me? Doctor? Do you have a moment?  
  
A moment? What's the question?  
  
More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3  
  
What's the problem?  
  
That is the problem, we're not sure  
  
You got the chart?  
  
Right here  
  
Not much here to say  
  
No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable  
  
Name?  
  
No sir  
  
Did someone drop him off?  
Maybe we could speak to them  
Let's get some background on this fella  
  
No ID. Nothing  
And he won't speak to anybody  
  
Well, let's say hello  
Good morning, I'm Dr. Lawson  
How are you today? How are you today?  
Look son, you're in a safe place  
We wanna help in whatever way we can  
But you need to talk to us  
We can't help you otherwise  
What's happened? Tell me everything
