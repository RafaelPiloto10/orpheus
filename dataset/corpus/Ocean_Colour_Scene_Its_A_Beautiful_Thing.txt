Sonny went and flipped away and said he had to go  
How could you ever say he never stayed alone  
And how could I belong with anyone you know  
Come on every line's a line I'll never know  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing  
  
Sometimes I can get along alone enough  
Backing everyone away and never have enough  
And how could I be playing every line for you  
Look at the things today that I can never choose  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing  
  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
  
And how could I be playing every line for you  
Look at the things today that I never choose  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing
