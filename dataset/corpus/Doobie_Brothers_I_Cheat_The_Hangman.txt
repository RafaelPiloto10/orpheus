The days grow short, the nights are gone  
Since you were here, I can't go on  
I cried for you, to no avail  
Now my life runs cold when the night winds wail  
But I cheat the hangman, cheated him many times before  
The bell that tolls the hour has turned sweet lips to sour  
Yes, I cheat the hangman and even when life has flown away  
I leave a kiss behind  
  
The rain that fell upon my stone  
Like tears you cry I shared alone  
I walk the night, I cannot sleep  
The love you spend you cannot reap  
  
The glow of love will then shine  
Lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home  
Only lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home
