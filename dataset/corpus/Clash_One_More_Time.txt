Must I get a witness? for all this misery  
There's no need to, brothers everybody can see  
That its one more time in the ghetto you know  
One more time if you please now  
One more time to the dying man  
They say one more time if you please  
  
The old lady kicks karate  
For just a little walk down the street  
The little baby he knows kung fu  
He tries it on those he meets  
'Cause its a one more time!  
  
You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty  
Watch when Watts town burns again  
The bus goes to Montgomery  
  
'Cause it's a one more time in the ghetto  
One more time if you please  
One more time for the dying man  
One more time to be free
