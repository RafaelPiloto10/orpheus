I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
  
Women think men belong in resorts  
We watch the children  
They watch the sports  
A man wouldn't help us  
Even if he could  
While we clean up the mess  
He's made of the neighborhood  
  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
  
Women refuse to witness the kill  
Of man's safaris and his battles of will  
She washes the wound he sustains in his fight  
She cradles him in her arms all night  
  
Woman is there  
At the end of the day  
She works as hard  
As a man can play  
She carries the blame  
She doesn't deserve  
She bears his name  
When he loses his nerve  
  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess
