Watching my window I was led like a  
Child  
As the roadway lamplight's  
Misguided my mind through the night  
A shadow of limits  
We were racing the rain  
My hands held the wheel  
My eyes tried to hold their place  
  
There must have been a time  
When I thought that you were  
Watching  
It had to be when my senses lost  
Control  
I thought I'd slipped away  
I thought I could still feel us  
Moving  
It must have been a cloud  
No bigger than a man's hand  
  
Every reason I risk my life  
To come back to you  
Is locked behind your door  
You're my immunity  
Outside I watched you burn  
Heavy hearts were bleeding  
A cry for help, a familiar voice  
My melting hands streaked the glass  
  
As I walked away  
I wondered what had really  
Happened  
Had I run out of time  
Did I push myself too far  
As my last step fell  
I felt my hands upon the wheel  
Had I come back to life  
Or did I ever leave at all  
  
In higher lives  
We seem to be  
Always a moment too late  
We're past the time  
When we looked on  
Now we're  
The ones who help to  
Set the sun  
This time for real  
I locked the door behind me  
My mind was still a wreck  
From what I saw  
For when my hands are still  
I'll recognize the message  
Never again will my senses lose  
Control  
In higher lives  
We seem to be  
Always a moment too late  
We're past the time  
When we looked on  
Now we're  
The ones who help to  
Set the sun
