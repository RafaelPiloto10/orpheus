Back in the day  
Oh, it wasn't that far.  
Not a day goes by  
That won't be in the back tomorrow.  
  
Take today as a sample to you.  
It looks cloudy outside,  
What are you gonna do  
Well, we could get up  
  
Or we could get on down  
We could drive to the country  
Or head downtown,  
Maybe I'll join you too  
  
We could have been so much better off  
Than before if we held on true  
Take today, and go walk for a while  
Well just sit back jack and relax  
  
And enjoy a smile  
Well let your mind go  
For a minute or two,  
Let your mind levitate  
  
For a delicate few.  
We could have been so much better off  
Than before if we held on true  
I said but lately I've been feeling mighty old  
  
I said the sun has got me cracked  
And this wind has got me cold  
And I'm so damn tired of losing my friends  
Every single time I go and lose my ends  
  
I say but that's okay, I'm on my way  
And in awhile when I realize  
There's something new  
but until then i got to hold on true
