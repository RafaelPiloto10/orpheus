The sky has fallen on my yesterday  
I watch my moon and blue sun (?) slip away  
Everybody's asking questions  
Everybody's wanting more  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why i don't know  
And i try to pull myself togehter  
I don't want to go home (?)  
  
The little girl has lost her way today  
The tables turning on the game she plays  
Everybody's asking questions  
Everybody's wanting more  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself, I (slip away) fall . . .
