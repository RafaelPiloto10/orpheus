Along came the F-15 the swiftest on the line  
Running over the C and O road just twenty minutes behind  
Running into Cevile head porters on the line  
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind  
  
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm  
Saying my darling son be careful how you run  
Many a man has lost his life by trying to make lost time  
But if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time  
  
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed  
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash  
His head was against the firebox door the flames were rolling high  
I'm glad I was born to be an engineer on the C and O road to die  
  
The doctor said to Georgie my darling son be still  
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will  
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free  
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three  
  
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved  
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave  
His face was covered up with blood his eyes you could not see  
The very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee
