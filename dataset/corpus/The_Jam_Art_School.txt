Anything that you want to do, anyplace that you want to go  
Don't need permission for everything that you want  
Any taste that you feel is right  
Wear any clothes just as long as they're bright  
Say what you want, 'cos this is a new art school  
Do what you want if it takes your mind  
Better do it now, 'cos you won't have time  
And never worry if people laugh at you  
The fools only laugh 'cos they envy you  
  
Time is motion and the hands are fast  
Young words are mumbled, they don't always last  
It's up to us to be sure they understand  
  
Who makes the rules that make people select  
Who is to judge that your ways are correct  
The media as watchdog is absolute shit  
The TV telling you what to think  
  
Anything that you want to do, anyplace that you want to go  
Don't need permission for everything that you want  
Any taste that you feel is right  
Wear any clothes just as long as they're bright  
Say what you want, 'cos this is a new art school  
Do what you want, 'cos this is the new art school
