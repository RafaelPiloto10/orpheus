  
  
  
  
You say you need some time on your own  
  
You say we should put our love on hold  
  
But, baby, don't leave me now all alone in the cold  
  
You said you believed in us  
  
But now your walking away from me  
  
  
Chorus: Don't calm the storm..(keep a walking baby)  
  
Just walk out that door  
  
Or you'll stay a while..(but you stayed a while)  
  
And we'll make it right  
  
Don't be afraid  
  
I know how to ease my pain  
  
  
I know there were things I said that were wrong  
  
... Girl, I always knew where my heart belonged  
  
If you want me to walk away I will, but it hurts me so  
  
Oh baby, open your eyes  
  
open you're ever Hear me now  
  
heam me now It doesn't have to be this way  
  
CHORUS x2
