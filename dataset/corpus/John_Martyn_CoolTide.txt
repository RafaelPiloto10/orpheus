So cool, what a cool time  
It's so cool, what a cool time  
That's what you're having, I'm having one too  
  
It's a cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, for running down the stream  
It's a cool cool time, for cutting up the profits  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool cool dream  
  
Some say the world is full of fools  
Other people agree  
Some say the world is full of fools  
Fools will always agree  
  
Such a cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, to be running down to the sea  
A cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream  
  
That's what you're having  
It's a cool cool dream  
  
It's a cool time, out in Arabia  
It's a cool time, when all the boys come home  
It's a cool cool time, out in South America  
A cool cool time, when all the money rolls in  
  
Cool time for running up the harbor  
It's a cool cool time, for running to the sea  
It's a cool cool time, running down the river  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream  
  
Meddling fools, give them a medal  
Don't let them meddle with me  
Meddling fools, meddling fools  
Don't you meddle with me, I don't like them  
  
It's a cool cool time, way out there in Africa  
It's a cool cool time, such a cultural edge  
A cool cool time, out with the brothers there  
A cool cool time, driving in the wedge  
  
Give them a medal  
Give them another precious medal and put a price on it  
Give that boy a medal  
Ask him to put a price on it, precious medal  
  
It's a cool time, out in Arabia  
This cool time  
It's a cool cool time, out in the Gulf of Arabia  
It's a cool cool time, when all your sons come home?  
  
It's such a cool time, turn your television on  
It's a cool time, it's a cool time, it's just a cool cool time  
Such a cool cool time, such a cool cool time  
It's just a cool cool time, just a cool cool time  
  
It's a chilling time, quite cool for killing  
Just a killing time, such a cool killing time  
  
It's a cool cool time, it's a cool cool time  
It's a cool cool time, such a cool cool time  
Cool time, such a cool cool time  
Turn your television on  
  
Cool time, such a cool cool time  
Turn your television on  
Such a cool cool time, it's a cool time  
Turn your television on  
It's a cool cool time, it's a cool cool time  
Such a cool cool time, it's a cool cool time
