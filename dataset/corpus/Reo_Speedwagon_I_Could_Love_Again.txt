I thought that I couldn't love again  
Till I saw you tonight  
Every word you say  
Smiles you throw my way  
Filled my heart with tenderness  
Once I was in love before  
But my heart was broken  
Every place I've been  
All the beauty I have seen  
Nothing means as much as you  
  
Baby I'm in love  
So in love with you  
I just can't believe  
That I could feel the way I do  
Yes I'm so in love  
So in love with you  
This feeling of love will never, never end  
I never thought that I could love again  
  
I have finally found someone  
Someone who really cares about the way I feel  
Everything that I do  
And fill my heart with happiness  
I've waited for a long time  
For a moment like this  
Now that I've found love  
It must not slip away  
We'll always be together  
  
Baby I'm in love  
So in love with you  
I just can't believe  
That I could feel the way I do  
Yes I'm so in love  
So in love with you  
This feeling of love will never, never end  
I never thought that I could love again
