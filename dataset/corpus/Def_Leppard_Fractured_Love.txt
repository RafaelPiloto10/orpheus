I'm caught in a dream  
Sometimes it ain't what it seems  
I'm all in a daze  
Can't find my way out of this maze  
I'm looking for clues  
And wanting a change in the rules  
I'm locked in a cage  
Acting out on the wrong stage  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream  
  
I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down  
Caught in the danger zone  
I feel like a king that has lost his crown  
And now I stand here alone  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream!!!  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I don't care if you pull down the sky  
Angry passion is a friend of mine  
Reach out for the sky above  
It's just a fractured love  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
Why don't you set me free!  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't want your third degree  
Just got to break  
Break away and scream!  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
Why don't you set me free  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
Don't give me your fractured love!
