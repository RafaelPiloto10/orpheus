The first time I met the blues  
People, you know I was walkin' down through the woods  
Yes, the first time I met the blues  
You know, you know I was walkin' down through the woods  
  
You stopped by my house first, Mister Blues  
And blues, you didn't do me much good  
You, should have heard me beggin'  
Blues, don't murder me  
  
Aw, you, you should have heard me begging  
Mister blues, don't you murder me  
You know, you be with me every morning, Mister Blues  
I just got to know what you want with me  
  
Ah, good morning, good morning, Mister Blues

Good morning, good morning, good morning  
Good morning, good morning, Mister Blues  
I wonder, I wonder what you're doin' here so soon  
  
You'll be with me every morning, Mister Blues  
You'll be here every night and every noon

Let's give Len a big hand
