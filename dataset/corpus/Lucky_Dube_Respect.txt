When you flash that badge  
You want everyone to shiver  
When you flash that badge  
You want everyone to worship you  
I got no time to worship human kind  
I only worship the All Mighty  
Through his prophets I have learned  
To give respect to everything he created  
I give love to those who love me  
Love those who gimme war  
I love those who hate me  
I bless even those who curse me yeah [Repeat x2]  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme gimme respect  
Show me show me respect  
  
You could be the president  
You could be his deputy  
You don't even have to know  
My political affiliation  
You don't even have to know  
My religious affiliation  
Respect me, for who I am  
And not what I am  
Nobody even cares about your dollars  
Nobody even cares about your bling bling  
  
Give love to those who give you love  
Give love to those who give you war  
Give love to those who hate you  
Bless even those who curse you, yeah [Repeat x2]  
  
[Chorus]
