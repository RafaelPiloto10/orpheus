Slow down girl, what's the hurry  
Love can wait if you're worried  
Then I'll try to ease your mind  
You say we're losing time  
  
But I've got to find  
A way to convince you  
I've got cause to be wary  
For so long I've had to carry  
  
The weight of another soul  
You say I won't let go  
But how do you know I can  
Give me some time now  
I've just got to find how  
I'm going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe I'll fall for you  
You're just what I've needed  
But I'd be unfair and conceited  
  
To say you're the only one  
Woman, I'm on the run  
From something I have begun  
And can't seem to finish  
Although it hasn't been recent  
I still think it wouldn't be decent  
  
To let you believe in me so soon  
I've got to make you see  
What she meant to me  
So please  
  
Give me some time now  
I've just got to find how  
I'm going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe I'll fall for you  
  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you
