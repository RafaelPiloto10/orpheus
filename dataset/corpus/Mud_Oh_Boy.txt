All my love, all my kissing  
You don't know what you've been a missing  
Oh boy  
When you're with me, oh boy  
The world will see that you were meant for me  
  
All my life, I've been a waiting  
Tonight there'll be no hesitating  
Oh boy  
When you're with me, oh boy  
The world will see that you were meant for me  
  
Stars apear and the shadow is a falling  
I can hear my heart a calling  
A little bit of lovin' make everything right  
I'm gonna see my baby tonight  
  
All my life, I've been a waiting  
Tonight there'll be no hesitating  
Oh boy  
When you're with me, oh boy  
The world will see that you were meant for me
