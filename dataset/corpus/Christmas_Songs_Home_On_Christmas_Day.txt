And now that winter's here  
Soon it will be Christmas  
I see your face so clear  
Though you're far away  
Your home is in my heart  
It's every where I go  
And I'll be waiting here  
'Til you're home to stay  
  
I think of Winters past  
When we were together  
The sweetest memories  
All come into play  
Your voice rings in my ear  
Just to let me know  
That you'll be here with me  
Home on Christmas day  
  
Angels calling from on high  
Will bring a starry sky  
To light the frosted  
Ground below  
So you will know  
Your way back home tonight  
A candle burns so bright  
To show the way  
  
I'll make a silent wish  
Just for you this Christmas  
To keep you safe and warm  
Never led astray  
That everywhere you go  
Is sheltered from the storm  
And that my Christmas wish  
Is with you every day  
Each and every day  
  
Angels callin' down to say  
They'll always know the way  
To lift you  
'Til you soar so high  
That I will see you  
In the sky above  
My Christmas gifts of love  
Will guide you back  
  
And now I promise you  
With all my heart  
This Christmas  
That all the love we shared  
Will never go away  
Your spirit's everywhere  
And I hope you know  
That you are always here  
Home on Christmas day  
Home on Christmas day
