We've been seeing what you wanted, got us cornered right now  
Fallen asleep from our vanity, might cost us our lives  
I hear they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created,  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
  
We've been searching all night long but there's no trace to be found  
It's like they all have just vanished but I know they're around  
I feel they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...  
  
I feel they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
The sun is rising  
The screams have gone  
Too many have fallen  
Few still stand tall  
Is this the ending of what we've begun?  
Will we remember what we've done wrong?  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...
