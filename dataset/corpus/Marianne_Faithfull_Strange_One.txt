I should have known  
You were a strange one.  
You should have said  
That you don't like to love.  
But you never told me no lies.  
Don't have to apologies.  
When everything's said and done,  
I was the strange one.  
  
I should have known  
You were a strange one.  
You should have said  
I don't want to love.  
But I never told you no lies.  
I don't want to apologies,  
When everything's said and done,  
What can I do ?  
That boy's in love with you.  
  
I should have seen it coming,  
I should have known what to expect.  
I could be off and running,  
Looking for my respect.  
You don't need to criticize,  
You never did realize,  
When everything's said and done,  
You were a strange one.  
  
You were a strange one.  
You were a strange one.  
You were a strange one.
