If I wrote you a symphony  
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do)  
If I told you you were beautiful  
Would you date me on the regular (Tell me would you)  
Well baby I've been around the world  
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)  
This ring here represents my heart  
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying I do)  
  
[Chorus]  
Because, I can see us holding hands  
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand  
I can see us on the country side  
Sitting in the grass laying side by side  
You can be my baby  
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me  
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy  
See all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love, my love, my love, my love  
  
Now If I wrote you a love note  
And made you smile with every word I wrote (What would you do)  
Would that make you wanna change your scene  
And wanna be the one on my team (Tell me would you)  
See what's the point in waiting anymore  
Cause girl I've never been more sure (That baby it's you)  
This ring here represents my heart  
And everything that you been waiting for (Just saying I do)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time to get it JT  
I don't what she hesitatin' for man  
  
Shorty, cool as a fan on the move once again  
But he still has fam from Peru to Japan  
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan  
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can  
Cause the girls really wild, throw they hands up high  
When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy  
You don't really wanna let the chance go by  
Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly  
Friends so fly I can go fly private, cause I handle mine  
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply cause I am on fire  
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny  
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die  
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?  
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie  
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high  
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy  
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space  
But forget your face, I swear I will  
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill  
Just bring wit me any pair, I will  
  
[Chorus]
