Light up everybody  
Join us in this celebration  
Light up and be happy  
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air  
  
Every day's a holiday when your lips meet mine  
The music's keepin' time with our love  
You are here, and so am I  
The weather's quite divine  
So pass me round your wine, lovely one  
  
All I need is just one hit to get me by  
'Cause baby when your near I'm halfway high  
  
Light up, everybody  
Join us in this celebration  
Light up and be happy  
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air
