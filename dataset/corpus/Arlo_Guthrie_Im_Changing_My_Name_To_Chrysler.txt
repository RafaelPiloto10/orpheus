By Tom Paxton  
Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight  
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight  
What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce  
No the economic forecast isn't right  
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray  
I can even glimpse a new and better way  
And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction  
And I'm going into action here today  
CHORUS:  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am going down to Washington D.C.  
I will tell some power broker  
What they did for Iacocca  
Will be perfectly acceptable to me  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am headed for that great receiving line  
So when they hand a million grand out  
I'll be standing with my hand out  
Yes sire I'll get mine  
When my creditors are screaming for their dough  
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go  
They won't have to scream and holler  
They'll be paid to the last dollar  
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow  
I'll be glad to tell them what they can do  
It's a matter of a simple form or two  
It's not just renumeration it's a liberal education  
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you  
CHORUS  
Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime  
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb  
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking  
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime  
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two  
But now it seems that there's a different point of view  
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic  
Down to congress there's a safety net for you  
CHORUS
