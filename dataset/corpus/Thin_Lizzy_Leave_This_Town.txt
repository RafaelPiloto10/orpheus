I better keep myself from being busted  
I better keep myself out of jail  
'Cause I ain't got a friend to get me trusted  
That's why my mama sends my money through the mail  
  
I've been down on my luck  
I've been down on my wealth  
I'm gonna start taking care of business  
Start taking care of my health  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight  
  
Well, I set off down the main street  
With such a long, long way to go  
But before I started I was cornered on the corner  
Still waiting for my sugar to show  
  
I've been down on my luck  
I've been down on my wealth  
I've gotta stop taking care of somebody's else's business  
Start taking care of myself  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight  
  
I was fooling around with the sheriff's daughter  
She was a real fine fox  
But the sheriff - he came after  
And threatened to lock me in a cell box  
  
He showed me his magnum  
He showed me his shotgun  
He stuck it in my face  
And said, "Boy, I think you best be gone."  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight
