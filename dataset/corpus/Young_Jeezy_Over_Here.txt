I'm in a new SS and the tag still on it  
And the pussy niggaz hating 'cause all the hoes on it  
She ask me why I looked so mean  
I said, "The Benz just boosted up to my self-esteem"  
Nigga I'm the shit and if I ain't y'all let me think what I think  
Matter of fact tell the waitress let me drink when I drink  
Nigga think I ain't, no need to brag  
Man these hoes love Jeezy, they just like my swag  
The way I do my thang

You trapping lil' daddy gon' get them boulders off  
And I'ma teach you how to stunt  
As soon as my niggaz roll up these blunts  
She said, "She like my domineer"  
Between me and you I think she's digging my Beemer  
Love the way a lil' nigga spit so slick  
Plus she heard I gotta big dick that's it  
Yeah, put it on me girl

I gotta a stable full of hoes and a trap full of dealers  
A house full of bloods and a click full of killers  
I'm heavy on the streets with a rep long as old Nash  
I hit a hater wit a heat from a cold gat  
We posted up on a black like a street light  
Watching the money move making sure I eat right  
Dollar for dollar and dime for dime  
We out here hustle for hustle, nigga grind for grind  
We got them nines in them halfs  
Even them old things grinding on them hash  
Folding for doe mane and we all in the dope game, buying and selling  
You haters buying and telling, but what is my niggaz yelling  
We getting money over here, what it do pimpin'  
See ya boys looking but y'all lame ain't tipping  
Hold up, a, yeah it's some wrong wit it  
If your money gon' nigga be the fuck on wit it  
And don't worry 'bout what the fuck we smokin' over here  
Don't worry 'bout what the fuck we drankin' over here  
Don't worry 'bout who the fuck was standing over here  
Don't worry 'bout how the fuck we dancing over here
