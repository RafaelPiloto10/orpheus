(In Japanese)  
As my hair is touching your shoulders  
Red winds are singing all over town  
Oriental! Hey-Ho! She's gonna be there climbing the stair.  
Flag waving up in the air.  
She's gonna be there, jungle somewhere...  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her.  
And Boy - Lay them on another girl.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
And Boy - You're gonna get burned Queen of Arts!  
Hey-Ho! Eyes of black meet eyes of blue.  
Beast and Beauty, wave goodbye.  
Sayonara Moon up in the sky.  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her...  
(in Japanese) I wish to say many things -  
But you are not here.  
I want to ask you a lot -  
But you are not here.  
You promised to be back soon,  
Was it only to comfort me?  
I do want to see you again  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her...  
(in Japanese)  
I beg you to return to me
