Saying goodbye is never an easy thing  
But you never said, you stay forever  
So if you must go darling, I'll set you free  
But I know in time, we'll be together  
I won't try to stop you now from leaving  
'Cause in my heart, I know  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
One of these nights, I'll hear your voice again  
You're gonna say, how much you miss me  
You walked out this door but someday you'll walk back in  
Darling I know, I know this will be  
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now  
To find your way back home  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
I won't try to stop you now from leaving  
'Cause in my heart I know  
Love will lead you back, I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, it won't be long  
One of these days my love will lead you back
