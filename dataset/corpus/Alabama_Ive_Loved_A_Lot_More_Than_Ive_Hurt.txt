Well I've spent more money than I've made  
And I've grown more whiskers than I've shaved  
I've worked harder getting out of work  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
I've spilled more whiskey than I've drank  
I drove up more gas than was in my tank  
I've lost a lot more than my shirt  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when you're broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what its worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Well I walk a lot more than I ride  
And I show a lot more than I hide  
I'm sometimes more trouble than I'm worth  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when you're broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what it's worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Yea the bottom line for what it's worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt
