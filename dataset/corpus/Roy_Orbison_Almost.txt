Almost, you fell in love with me  
Almost, you were my bride to be  
But someone new came by  
And you left me here to cry  
Oh how close we were, almost  
  
Almost, I heard the church bells ring  
Almost, I heard the choir sing  
Well, each promise that was made  
You have broken and betrayed  
Oh how close we were, almost  
  
Almost, my every dream came true  
Almost, I heard you say "I Do"  
But I hear now instead  
All those unkind words you said  
Oh how close we were, almost  
Oh how close we were, almost  
Oh how close we were, almost
