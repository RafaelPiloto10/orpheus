I Clown Walk jump back with the beat  
Breathin with a step and a slap on the cheek  
Foot work hear me squat when I walk by  
With your hawk eye you get a chalk line  
I dance up and down steps when I gotta  
Clown walkin on my hands I gotcha  
Big love if you love that to  
Walkin right past those foos doin the statue  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off  
They call me showcase showoff  
Sky whisky walks walk like a hawk  
Freestyles for the chosin few  
For me and my crew only pay per view  
Caterpillar or electric boogie  
They call me walkwalla crunk when I wookie  
So crazy with the ill behavior  
Fresh flavor step with the majors  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off  
Put your right foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!  
Put your left foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!  
Everything I'm big time super duper  
Iv met my homie remy let me introduce ya  
Walkin late for squares in fact its deadly  
Shed blood on the dance floor I ain't frendly  
Boom boom clap let the rhythm proceed  
Boom boom clap from the iron in my sleve  
4:00 am roll around I had enough  
But the tricks still flocked just to brush my shoes off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk  
That's how you set it off  
When you do the Clown Walk
