[Chorus: x2]  
Oh  
Girl you better (oh)  
St-Stop playin' (oh)  
Bitch what'cha waitin' for  
Get your ass on the floor  
  
You know the night was good  
When you wake up in the morning  
With a cloudy piss  
You know how I do  
Gimme the vodka skip the cris  
I'm at the bar feelin' like 50 takin' like 9 shots  
I got like 9 broads takin' 'em with me why stop  
Now I'm bouncin' from broad to broad  
This thing is thick from wall to wall  
I've never read the book  
But its like I mastered the art of war  
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage  
'cause I've had a couple of drinks think again  
Ill have you like kanye west  
With a brand new jaw and a metal chin  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Excuse me I'm takin' over  
I'm sick like Ebola  
I don't know what they told ya  
But bitch this chico's a soldier  
Get the crip and roll up  
Or drop the E and roll out  
Most of these busta's fold up  
When its time to thug out  
I'm a take it to the club  
Where them freaks be takin' it off and backin' it up  
I'm a make ya so hot as soon as these mami's walk in they ready to fuck  
Every (every) body (body) listen (listen) closely  
'cause imma do what's never been done  
The games been fucked but its never been sprung  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
Oh oh oh  
Get your ass on the floor  
  
Oh  
Girl  
Oh  
St-Stop playin' (oh)  
Bitch what'cha waitin' for  
Get your ass on the floor  
Get your ass on the floor
