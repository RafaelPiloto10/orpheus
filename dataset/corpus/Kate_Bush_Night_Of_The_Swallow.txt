The night doesn't like it  
Looks just like your face on the moon to me  
And I won't let you do  
What you want to do  
It's funny how, even now, you're laughing.  
  
I won't let you do it!  
  
If you go, I'll let the law know  
And they'll head you off when you touch the ground  
Ooh, please, don't go through with this  
I don't like the sound of it  
It's funny how, even now, you're miles away  
  
I won't let you do it  
I won't let you do it  
I won't let you go through with it!  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
I'll just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
  
Like a swallow  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
In Malta, catch a swallow  
For all of the guilty to set them free  
Wings fill the window  
And they beat and bleed  
They hold the sky on the other side of borderlines  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
I'll just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
Like a swallow flying to Malta  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
Give me a break!  
Oh, let me try!  
Give me something to show  
For my miserable life!  
Give me something to take!  
Would you break even my wings  
Just like a swallow?  
  
Let me, let me go  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
But you're not a swallow!
