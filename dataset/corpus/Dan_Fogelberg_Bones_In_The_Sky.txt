Up through the branches  
The stars shine above  
On the arroyos  
And mesas you loved  
And as the moon rises  
The black mountain mourns  
For the old friend  
He'll look on no more  
Jacks-In-The-Pulpit  
  
Bones in the sky  
Long winding rivers  
That never ran dry  
And the secrets she gathered  
From the wild blowing sands  
Breathed in her heart  
And her hands  
  
I sing to your spirit  
Where all my dreams dwell  
The vision, the freedom  
The life lived so well  
And I sing in your canyons  
And the echoes ring clear  
And I wish somehow  
You may still hear
