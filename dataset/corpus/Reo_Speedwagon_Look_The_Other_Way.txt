I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
She loves me too much  
That's just something she wouldn't do  
  
Now you may say I look the other way  
You may think I'm blind  
But I say don't go looking for what you don't want to find  
  
Wouldn't I be the one that you'd come running to  
Wouldn't they be my arms  
I look into your eyes as you tenderly hold me  
So safe and secure, oh how I wish I were  
  
I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
  
I say to myself, I've given all I can  
I tell myself this game must end  
But in the mirror do I see a new man  
Or will I look the other way again?  
  
I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
  
I know it, you know it, everybody knows it  
I can't look the other way  
I won't look the other way again
