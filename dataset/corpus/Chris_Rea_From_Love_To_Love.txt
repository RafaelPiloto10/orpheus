Well if you want me then just take my hand  
And if you don't, I will understand  
It's just a call from deep within my soul  
The burning question, I have got to know  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love  
And if I ask you will you take this dance  
Please don't think you're taking some big chance  
It's just a fire and it burns for you  
You know there's one thing that you've got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love  
  
I'll share your secrets on a rainy day  
Cause if you'll have me then we'll be away  
Oh there's a fire and it burns for you  
You know there's one thing that you've got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love
