I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill,  
Sorrow and pain for me  
Coming over the hill.  
I'm very sad Lost love for me  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who breaks every heart that he can.  
I know him well  
For I have been hurt by this man.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who promises that he'll be true  
And I look back once again,  
Well, what else could I do ?  
I'm very sad  
But he is true  
And we will love again.  
I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill.  
I see him and he says  
That he'll stay  
And he will.  
I'm sad no more,  
He comforts me  
And we will love again.
