(Stephen Bishop)  
You called me from the room in your hotel  
All full of romance for someone that you'd met  
And telling me how sorry you were  
Leaving so soon  
And that you'll miss me sometimes  
When you're alone  
Do I feel lonely too?  
You have no right to ask me how I feel  
You have no right to speak to me so kind  
We can't go on, holding on to time  
Now we're living separate lives  
Well I have learned to let you go  
And if you lost your love for me  
You never let it show  
There was no way to compromise  
So now we're living  
Now we're living separate lives  
Ooh, it's so difficult  
Love leads to isolation  
So you build that wall  
You build that wall  
Yes you build that wall  
Oh yes, you build that wall  
And you make it stronger  
You have no right to ask me how I feel  
You have no right to speak to me so kind  
Some day I might  
I just might find myself looking in your eyes  
But for now,  
We'll go on living separate lives  
Yes for now,  
We'll go on living separate lives  
Separate lives...  
Separate lives...
