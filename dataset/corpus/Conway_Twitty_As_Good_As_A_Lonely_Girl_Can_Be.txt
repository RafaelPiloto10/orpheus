Tell me darling have I been away too long  
I was wrong to leave but now I'm coming home  
Have you missed me I kind of hope you would and jokingly I ask are you being
good  
I'm being good as lonely girl can be  
And there's no other place on earth I'd rather be  
To lie here beside him oh Lord how sweet love can be  
I'm being good as lonely girl can be  
It was just too much for me I should've known  
You were just too much a woman to me alone  
I just realized I love you much too late and Lord it's killing me to hear you
say  
I'm being good as lonely girl can be...  
Tell me darling have I been away too long  
I know I was wrong to leave but now all I wanna do is come back home  
You're just too much to me I know I should've known  
You were just too much woman for me to leave alone
