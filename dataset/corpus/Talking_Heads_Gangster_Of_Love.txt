Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
You with that cocktail in your hand  
You in your red Mercedes Benz  
Goin' in one ear and out the other  
Cover up the pain with laughter, baby  
I'm not laughing, ha ha ha  
I'm not laughing  
  
Hey Al Capone  
Is that who you think you are?  
All the girls  
All around the world  
Well they, wanna shake your hand  
It won't be long  
You'll need an alibi  
A little bird  
Told me what he'd heard  
Is it really true?  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
  
I'm gonna take you for a ride  
And hit you right between the eyes  
You can hear the pretty music playin' well  
Listen to the words that I'm saying,  
You can hear them calling', hear them calling'  
  
Hey, Al Capone  
You'll need a bodyguard  
Just like that  
You'll be laid out flat  
With a broken heart  
I shot you down  
Who's gonna help you now?  
Valentine's day  
Better hope and pray  
They'll be tearing you apart  
Gangster of love, Gangster of love  
Gangster of love, Gangster of love  
  
I hear conversations  
In restaurants and bars  
I read all the papers  
And what they say is wrong  
It's such a fine, fine line  
Such a fine, fine line  
  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love
