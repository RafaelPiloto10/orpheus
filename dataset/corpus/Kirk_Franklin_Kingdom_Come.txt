I've been up I've been down been looking for some joy to come around I've been  
Praying for some sunshine been looking for a love that I can call mine. See
I've  
Cried for so long now I'm ready for the tears to be gone so I'm calling you
right  
Now cause you said that I can make it Lord any how  
  
Chorus: so I'm gonna wait (on you)  
Cause I know that your gonna pull (me through)  
I hear you telling me to (be strong)  
Cause deliverance is coming and (it wont be long)  
The storm will pass (away)  
I believe its gonna be (a brighter day)  
I can finally see (the sun)  
So I'm waiting on you til (Thy kingdom come)  
  
This world can be cold and I can feel te hurting in my soul but the pain it  
Wont last long cause I know its only here to make me strong just take it from  
Me some day we're gonna be free we been waiting Lord for a night but the Lord  
Said its gonna be alright
