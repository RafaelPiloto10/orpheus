Come on [Repeat: x4]  
  
I look around  
Unsatisfied  
At what they're giving me  
Then I think  
To myself  
Is there someone else  
Who feels the same as me  
Do you feel the same baby  
  
When my back is broken  
When the mountain moves away  
All the dreams and promises  
That we give  
We give away  
  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
  
Look ahead  
But don't mix it up  
Baby look ahead  
To better days  
And better ways  
Make peace  
With flesh and blood  
Make peace  
With your love  
  
Nothing more I could ask of you  
In the end this is the truth  
  
When my back is broken  
When the mountain moves away  
All the dreams and promises  
That we give  
We give away  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked
