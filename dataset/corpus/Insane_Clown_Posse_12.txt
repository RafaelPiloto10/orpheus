12  
"Wake...  
Revenge is mine  
12 people will die tonight"  
[Violent J]  
Now I look and then reborn  
Though I have just until dawn  
I remember every face  
Spirits show me every place  
First one sleeps inside his bed  
Place my fingers on his head  
To each temple push and smother  
Till my fingers touch each other  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Next one makes love to his wife  
Only wish to take his life  
For his family's done no wrong  
Place his children on the lawn  
Tell the misses, leave the room  
Less she wish to witness doom  
Grab the squirming filthy goat  
And shove the dresser down his throat  
[Violent J]  
I must quickly use my gift  
Next two work the midnight shift  
Drinking coffee in the back  
I will listen to them chat  
Hear them speaking of my death  
Hear the laughter in their breath  
But the laughter quickly died  
When their heads collide  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
[Violent J]  
Now my anger's growing worse  
Next one's working as a nurse  
Have to make a doctor's call  
Drag my body down the hall  
Grab a scalple and a blade  
Time to play the nurse's aide  
Operate and strap her down  
Carve her face into a clown  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Killed another then three more  
Now we're down to only four  
This man drives a taxi cab  
Another wicked life to grab  
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died  
Let's go for a taxi ride  
In the wreck of twisted steel  
The stearing wheel becomes his meal  
[Violent J]  
This man watches his TV  
Scanning channels endlessly  
Stops at station forty-four  
It's the Wicked Clown Show  
Watch me juggle, watch me dance  
In 3-D watch me enhance  
Watch me crawl out from the screen  
And squeeze your neck until you're green  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
Time...  
[Violent J]  
Even though, there's just one left  
I feel my bones becoming stiff  
And now I wonder endlessly  
The spirits have abandoned me  
My limbs are falling piece by piece  
My ears and fingers in the street  
But still yet see no morning sun  
And here's my victim's early run  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Quickly grab him from behind  
Round his neck with fishing twine  
Keep him still and pull the string  
Watch his head go bobbaling  
Listen to my riddle song  
Even though my crime was wrong  
Murder me just for your law  
And I'll be back for all y'all  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
I'll be back for all y'all...
