Note: This is a diffrent version of Red House than on the Are You Experienced?
Album. The lyrics are much the same but Jimi's guitar is a lot diffrent.  
  
Yeah

there's A red house, over yonder  
that's where my baby stays  
yeah  
there's A red house over yonder, baby  
that's where my baby stays  
  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
in about A ninety-Nine and one half days  
it's about time to see her  
wait minute something's wrong  
This key won't unlock this door  
wait A minute something's wrong, baby

I got A bad bad feeling  
that my baby don't live here no more  
she ain't comin' about is she  
that's alright I still got my guitar  
  
Look out baby

I might as well A go on back down  
Go back across yonder over the hill  
might as well go back over yonder  
Way back over yonder across the hill  
that's where I came from  
  
Cause if my baby don't love me no more  
I know here sister will!  
Yeah
