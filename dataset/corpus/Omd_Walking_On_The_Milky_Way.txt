Walking on the milky way  
  
When I was only seventeen  
My head was full of brilliant dreams  
My heart would call and I would gladly go  
At twenty one the world was mine  
And I was yours and you're divine  
And nothing else would matter to us so  
I don't believe in destiny  
I don't believe in love  
I don't believe that anything will ever be enough...  
  
Man you should have seen us  
On the way to venus  
Walking on the milky way  
It was quite a day hey hey...  
Walking on the big stuff  
Acting like were real tough  
Baby we were on our way  
So what do you say hey hey.  
  
As time goes by reality  
Destroys your hope and dignity  
There's nothing left but shadows on the wall  
But just remember who you are  
And where youve been youve come so far  
And never ever let them see you fall  
I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in truth  
I don't believe that anything can recreate your youth  
  
Man you should have seen us  
On the way to venus  
Walking on the milky way  
It was quite a day hey hey...  
Walking on the big stuff  
Acting like were real tough  
Baby we were on our way  
So what do you say hey hey  
  
Man you should have seen us  
On the way to venus  
Walking on the milky way  
It was quite a day hey hey...  
Walking on the big stuff  
Acting like were real tough  
Baby we were on our way  
So what do you say hey hey
