Little catholic girl is fallin' in love  
A face on a page, a gift from above  
She should've known better than to give her heart  
She should've known better than to ever part without me, without me  
I gave her everything that I ever owned  
I think she understood it but she never spoke  
She shouldn't oughta try to be that way  
She shouldn't have to go there every day without me, without me  
  
Now listen to us good and listen well  
Listen to us all and everything we tell  
We should've known better than to give her away  
We should've known better to this very day, without me, without me  
Listen Joan of Arc, all you gotta do  
Say the right words and I'll be coming through  
Hold you in my arms and take you right away  
Now she's turned away to another land  
We never understood it why she gave her hand  
She shouldn't oughta promise, cause it's just pretend  
I know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again without me, without me  
Without me, without me
