In our diabolical rapture we live on and on  
And death keeps knocking at our door  
So we open the door and we die a bit more  
We're in love with with death and we die on and on  
Won't you close our eyes  
We'll be by your side  
In your heavenly rapture we die on and on  
And you keep waiting at our door  
Yes - we open the door  
Let us die a bit more  
Because we're in love with you and we die on and on  
Won't you close our eyes  
We'll be by your side  
Your love is the only thing I live for in this world  
Oh how I wait for the day your heart burns  
In these heavenly flames I've already scorched in  
I just want you to know  
I'll always be waiting
