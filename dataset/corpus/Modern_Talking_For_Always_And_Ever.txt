Do You Wanna Hear My Story?  
I Know It Wasn't Much Of Glory  
Now I Found Someone To Believe - It's You  
You Took My Life - Colored All My Lonely Day's  
And I'm So Proud To Hear You Say.....  
  
For Alway's And Ever - Take It From My Heart  
Take It From The Start - For Alway's And Ever  
We Are Strong - Together Now.....  
  
Love Is A Flowing Of Emotions  
Two Hearts Are Living Through The Motions  
You Will See Nothing's Tearing Us Apart  
You Took My Life - Colored All My Lonely Day's  
And I'm So Proud - To Hear You Say.....  
  
Love Can Change Your Life Forever  
And You, You Give Me Everything  
Everything That I Need.....
