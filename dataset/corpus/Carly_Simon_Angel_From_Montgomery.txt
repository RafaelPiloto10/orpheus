I am an old woman  
Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child that's grown old  
If dreams were thunder  
And lightening was desire  
Then this old house  
Would have burnt down  
A long time ago  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl  
I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at  
Just a free rambling man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I try  
Well  
The years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear 'em there buzzing  
And I ain't done nothing  
Since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening  
And have nothing to say  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go
