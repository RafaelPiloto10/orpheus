Five years old  
A life that made me shy  
I'm telling you  
Shikaiya made me feel like I could fly  
There she was so crazy  
But she was on fire  
The smile behind the door of every answer to my questions  
You made it seem like everything was possible  
And that's where you stood out from everybody else  
Shikaiya  
That's what your about and you should never lose yourself  
Shikaiya  
Down the phone years and miles apart  
We try to find the magic we used to bounce from heart to heart  
But you don't seem to believe in anything today  
I wonder if your dreams got smashed  
Upon the rocks of that old bay  
You made me feel like everything was beautiful  
And that's where you stood out from everybody else  
Shikaiya  
And that's what your about and you should never lose yourself  
Shikaiya  
Shikaiya nothing  
Mmm Shikaiya  
Shikaiya  
Shikaiya  
That's what your about and you should never lose yourself  
Shikaiya  
Shikaiya
