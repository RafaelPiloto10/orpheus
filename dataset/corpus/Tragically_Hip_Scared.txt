I could make you scared if you want me to I'm not prepared, but if I have to
he said, I can make you scared, it's kinda what I do  
If you're prepared, here's what I can put you through you're in Russia and
more than a million works of art are wicked out to the  
Woods so when Nazis find the whole place dark they'd think god's left the
museum for good  
  
I make you scared, if that's what I do if you're prepared, if I have to if I
make you scared and you pay me to if that's the deal  
Now here's what I can do for you  
  
Now there's a focus group that can prove this is all nothing but cold
calculation  
  
Tests have shown that suspicious or hostile their lives need not be shortened
truth be told they can live a long, long while tickled  
To death by their importance  
  
If you make me scared, if that's what you do if I'm unclear can I get out of
this thing with me and you if you feel scared, a bit  
Confused, I gotta say this sounds a little beyond anything I'm used to  
  
Now there's a precious few that can prove that at the root this is all nothing
but a cold calculation  
  
Clearly entranced, you're leaning back now defanged destroyer limps into the
bay down at the beach it's attracting quite a  
Crowd as kids wade through blood out to it to play  
  
Okay you made me scared, you did what you set out to do I'm not prepared,
really had me going there for a minute or two he  
Said, you made me scare too, I wasn't sure I was getting through I gotta go,
it's been a pleasure doing business with you
