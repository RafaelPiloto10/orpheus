I been hungry way down in my heart  
Waiting for a reason  
I been hungry like a lot of guys  
I want to be beside you  
Lonely people pass me in the street  
Waiting for a reason  
  
Beside you  
Grey is turning to blue  
You wake up love in me  
Beside you  
Everything is new  
You wake up love in me  
I been hungry way down where it hurts  
Waiting for a reason  
I been hungry like a lot of guys
