Look at you you're talking to yourself  
Could it maybe be a cry for help  
Can't see the forest from your tree there  
  
Sometimes I think you're doing well  
Other times you put yourself through hell  
It's enough to bring you to your knees dear  
  
I'm gonna open up to you  
It's all I'm really trying to do  
Say what's on my mind  
Yeah what's on my mind, singin'  
  
If you wanna have it your way  
Yeah you gotta do things my way  
If you really wanna have it your way  
All you gotta do is do things my way  
  
You've had me by the little hairs  
Running here and there and everywhere  
Now I know exactly how your mind is wired  
  
I always knew this day would come  
To face the monster you've been hiding from  
So either douse the flame of love  
Or stoke the fire  
  
Or we can play this guessing game  
I call your bluff you do the same  
We're just wasting time  
Wasting all my time, listen  
  
If you wanna have it your way  
Yeah you gotta do things my way  
If you really wanna have it your way  
All you gotta do is do things my way  
  
I know you never like to compromise  
But when you think of all the lonely nights  
And I see that look in your eyes  
I'd say it's time to simplify your thinking  
  
Why does it have to be so hard  
To play your hand and show your cards  
If you will I will  
If you will I will  
  
Before you get your just desserts  
Let me clear your table first  
Have you, have you had your fill  
  
If you wanna have it your way  
Yeah you gotta do things my way  
If you really wanna have it your way  
All you gotta do is do things my way  
  
If you wanna have it your way  
Yeah you gotta do things my way  
If you really wanna have it your way  
All you gotta do is do things my way
