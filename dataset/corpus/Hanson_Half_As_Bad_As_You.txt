One, two, three four...  
  
You know that I want you  
You know that I need you too  
When you look at me I hope you believe  
That what I say is true  
So I'm gonna show ya  
The feelings I have for you  
But you need to know I have no control  
Of the things you make me do  
Well I know you don't understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
(Hand, hand, hand, hand...)  
  
I don't know how much more I can take (more I can take)  
I'm stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake (don't want to wake)  
Is this real or is this a mistake?  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you  
  
You say that you want me  
You say that you need me too  
But you can't mean the words you say  
The way I know I do  
I said that I love you  
I tell them you're mine  
They just turn and walk away  
It happens all the time  
But I know they don't understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
(Hand, hand, hand, hand...)  
  
I don't know how much more I can take (more I can take)  
Stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake (don't want to wake)  
This is real and it ain't no mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you  
  
I hope these words get your attention  
Sometimes I get carried away  
With what I say is it okay-ay-ay-ayy?  
  
I don't know how much more I can take  
Stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake  
'Cause this is real and it's not a mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
You love me and I love you  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you
