You say it's hard on you  
and sometimes to much to bear  
baby I understand and believe me  
I'm afraid of losing it too  
I wish I was the girl  
that sits across the room in your class  
the I would watch you  
And countevery freckle  
That's across your sweet face  
  
So many things I wanna do  
bot I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pain is too great  
so many things I wanna say  
but I guess it's too late  
  
Life ain't always  
the way you want it to be  
and that's okay  
cause something tells me hunn  
that this is the way  
I have to take  
  
So many things I wanna do  
but I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pains too great  
and so many things I wanna do  
but I guess it's too late  
  
I don't want to  
Be a burden on you  
I don't want you  
to see me like I used to be  
so let's be honest  
about the wa to proceed  
for the sak of the chanc of  
making something more beautiful  
cause sometimes baby  
friendships can last you a lifetime  
  
So many things I wanna do  
but I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pain is too great  
so many things I wanna say  
but I guess it's too late
