Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Sleeping really late  
Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Not feeling so great  
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns  
Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Dogs digging up the ground  
  
And I feel the light  
In the night and in the day  
And I feel the light  
When the sky's just mud and grey  
And I feel the light  
When you tell me it's OK  
Cos you're so great, and I love you  
  
Tea Tea and coffee  
Helps to start the day  
Tea Tea and coffee  
Shaking all the way  
City's alive and, surprise, so am I  
Tea, tea and coffee  
Get no sleep today  
  
And I feel the light  
In the night and in the day  
And I feel the light  
When the sky's just mud and grey  
And I feel the light  
When you tell me it's OK  
Cos you're so great, and I love you
