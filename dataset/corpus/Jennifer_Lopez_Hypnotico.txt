All the girls that know that they're sexy  
Come on  
  
Flip it, slap it down  
It's gonna get nasty  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
Shimmy shakers, earthquakers  
Something in the ci-ity  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
Love me for my body  
I'm original sexy  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing  
We're just some silly heart breakers tonight (tonight)  
All the boys, all want it, but it don't mean a thing  
We got tonight (tonight)  
We're just some silly heart breakers tonight  
  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
Red eyes, widen, envious smiles  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
Sunburn, baby, hurts like cra-azy  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
Hungry for some yum, yum  
Gonna get me some, some  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
All the boys go crazy  
All the boys go crazy  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
Wind up your body like you're a Boricua  
All of the men have a silly heart breaker  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Tonight  
All the boys, all want it, but it don't mean a thing  
We got tonight (tonight)  
We're just some silly heart breakers tonight  
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
