Storm warning,  
Feels like a heavy rain.  
Winds on the coast tonight.  
We may get tossed tonight.  
  
Storm warning,  
He's made it pretty plain  
He's fallin' for another,  
Found a new lover, and he won't be back again.  
  
Can't stop a river,  
When it's burst it's banks.  
I've seen the look in his eyes  
He's in love and hypnotized.  
  
Time of mourning.  
There's already been a flood of my tears.  
Such a sense of loss tonight,  
Nought to do but ride it out.  
  
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks.  
I wonder how long it's gonna take  
To get over this heartbreak.  
  
Storm warning,  
Feels like a heavy rain.  
Winds on the coast tonight.  
We may get tossed tonight.  
  
Storm warning...
