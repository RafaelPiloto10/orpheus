(Original by Big Star )  
  
Won't you let me walk you home from school  
Won't you let me meet you at the pool  
Maybe Friday I can  
Get tickets for the dance  
And I'll take you  
Won't you tell your dad, "Get off my back"  
Tell him what we said 'bout 'Paint It Black'  
Rock 'n Roll is here to stay  
Come inside where it's okay  
And I'll shake you.  
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of  
Would you be an outlaw for my love  
If it's so, well, let me know  
If it's "no", well, I can go  
I won't make you
