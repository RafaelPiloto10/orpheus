To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your headache to the shape of the 1980's  
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more  
I'm tired of playing in your fashion war  
  
To the lights to the trend setting in your head  
Sunday nights tear from the youth cults already dead  
I'm glad that we don't hear you and more  
I'm tired of fighting in your fashion war  
  
[Chorus:]  
Goodbye seventies  
  
To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your subscription for the million copies of 1980  
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more  
I'm tired of losing in your fashion war  
  
[Chorus]
