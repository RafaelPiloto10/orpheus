Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away  
And I'm wonderin' why you left  
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight  
  
I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile  
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say  
  
There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight  
You don't know how desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say  
  
And there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself  
  
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself  
Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, ain't missing you, oh no  
No matter what my friends might say, I ain't missing you...
