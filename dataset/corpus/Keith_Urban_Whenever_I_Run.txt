I've seen that darkness on the edge of town  
The sun come up and the rain fall down  
And I've been a fool, yeah I've been around  
  
And when the world got too much for me  
I took off and left a memory  
Thinking I'd find something better for me somehow  
Oh but now  
  
[Chorus]  
Whenever I run  
Instead of running into the blue  
I follow my heart  
And there in your arms  
Is where I find the love I need  
And the best is yet to come  
Baby you're the one I run to  
  
I used to quit when it got too tough  
Throw in my cards when I was down on my luck  
But baby you mean too much to me  
So now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never could stay in one place too long  
I never could stand that still  
Ah but you changed so much in me  
And now I know I will  
  
I'm gonna stay where the love is right  
I'm so tired of being a bird in flight  
Good love takes work  
Ah but that's alright  
That's alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Instead of running into the blue  
I follow my heart  
And there in your arms  
That's where I find the love I need  
And the best is yet to come  
Baby you're the one I run to  
The one I run to  
The one I run to
