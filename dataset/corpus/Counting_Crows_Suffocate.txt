Good morning baby, guess you wanna touch me now  
You wanna put your hands on my face  
Tell me you love me,  
Tell me you need me  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say anything...  
'Cause I am not that kind of man, I'm much less than you think I am...  
So many people are just like Jesus,  
They drag all this weight, to get to anything better than...  
Where they've been  
Or where they are  
Well tell me what the hell's the reason when we never get  
Anywhere...  
But you want me to say "Hey, it's okay..."  
But I'm so dizzy baby, just get the hell away from me...  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
I can't even sleep when you're with me...  
I'm sick of summertime  
I know, all of the best things in life are unkind  
To be everything I could be, anything  
But all the time I'm thinking, "If I only had a pair of wings..."  
But you want touch me  
Just get your hands off me  
Don't touch me  
And baby, I can't see that you see  
How can you see?  
How can you breathe?  
I can't feel a thing when you're with me...  
I can't take it this way, I hope you understand,  
Don't you fucking touch me  
I can hardly stand to look at you  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
I can't even sleep when you're with me  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
I can't feel...  
I can't feel a thing...  
Can't feel a thing...  
Can't feel a thing...  
Can't feel a thing...
