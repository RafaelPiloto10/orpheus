I've sailed an ocean  
I've sailed an ocean before you  
Thought I was free  
Thought that I was free before I met you  
Now I'm no longer the same  
I've found the dream that  
I have been waiting for  
I'm always calling your name  
Feeling joy that I never knew before  
Let's celebrate this better day  
I've climbed a mountain  
I've climbed a mountain before you  
Thought I was wise  
Thought I was wise before I met you  
Now everything is so clear  
I want to be beside you,  
Won't ever leave you  
And I am so lost in love  
That every day I'm waiting for you  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
This destiny  
Has been designed for me by someone  
This mystery  
Has all the signs to make me hold on  
There'll come a day I know now  
A better day when we will belong together  
It's just a touch away now  
Just a kiss and we will be there  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
It's just a touch away now  
Just a kiss and we will be there  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
This better day  
This better day
