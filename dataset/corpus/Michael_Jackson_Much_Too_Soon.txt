She's there just sitting at the table  
Thinking out that things won't be the same  
And wouldn't you like to go with me  
And she answered "no" to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon  
  
I never thought she'd leave me here forever  
But who knows just what the future brings  
And wouldn't you like to go with me  
And she answered "no" to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon  
  
Take away this never ending sorrow  
Take this lonely feeling from my soul  
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow  
She'd be sitting here beside me  
And my heart would dimly go  
  
I hope to make a change now for the better  
Never letting fate control my soul  
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see  
The day that she'll come back to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon  
  
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon.
