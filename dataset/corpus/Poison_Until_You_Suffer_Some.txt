Lately I can tell that something ain't right  
I don't see the fire when I look in your eyes  
One time up, and the next time down  
This may be the last time that you see me around, said  
  
Well it sure seems to me nothing matters tonight  
And all those things we worked out, they got lost in the fight  
It's not enough, girl, that I gave you my soul  
I just want to know if we've got anything left at all, and I say  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice  
  
Well promises made in the heat of the night  
You could sure spit them out, girl, but they've long passed me by  
Nobody knows about the show you put me through  
This could be the last time that I get through to you  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice  
  
Well I can't stand to see no more damage done  
But you'll never understand until you suffer some, and I said  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice
