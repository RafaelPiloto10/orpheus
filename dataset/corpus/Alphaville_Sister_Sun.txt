Tell me is it really true  
There's something goin' on  
Outside  
I just can feel it  
I heard it on the radio  
I'm not allowed to go  
Outside  
I can't believe it  
There's a big hole in the sky  
Where the radiation's breaking through  
And we just sit and stare  
Like the rabbit at the snake  
There's so much we could do  
But we gotta do it now  
Cause it's gettin' pretty late  
Better hurry now  
We all need the sun  
We need love and light for everyone  
We need our atmosphere  
To live in here  
We could be so strong  
We overthrow the government and stop  
What's goin' wrong  
We're fighting for the sun  
It's really hard to understand  
The change of sister sun  
As if your sunny smile  
Would turn into a deadly one  
It's not a quality of life  
To live inside a mighty trap  
To have that ice-cold coke beyond the radiation gap  
There should be more resistance  
Against industrial trusts  
And if there's no solution, there should be revolution  
I wonder if we start in time, we're racing with the seconds  
I wonder if we've got enough to talk to stupid politicians  
We all need the sun...  
Hold on to revolution... Members of the earth, lets fighting for the sun
