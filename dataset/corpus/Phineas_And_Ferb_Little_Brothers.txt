Little Brother,  
I remember when you first came home,  
Then came another, little brother of our own.  
Even when you break my toys,  
You will always be my,  
Little brothers,  
'Cuz you're younger,  
We're related, and you're boys.  
Even when your making too much noise,  
You will always be my,  
Little brothers,  
'Cuz you're younger,  
We're related, and you're boys  
Little brothers,  
Little brothers,  
Little brothers.
