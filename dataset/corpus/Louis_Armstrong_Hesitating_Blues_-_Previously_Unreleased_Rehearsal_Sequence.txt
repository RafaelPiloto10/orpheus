Hello central, what's the matter with this line?  
I wanna talk to that high brown of mine  
Tell me how long will I have to wait  
Please give me two ninety eight, why do you hesitate?  
  
Oh, what you say, can't talk to my brown?  
A storm last night blowed the wires all down  
Now, tell me how long will I have to wait  
Oh, won't you tell me now, why do you hesitate?  
  
Say, Sunday night, my beau proposed to me  
Said, he'd be happy if his wife I'd be  
Said he, "How long, baby, will I have to wait?"  
Come be my wife, my Kate, why do you hesitate?  
  
Say, I declined him, it was just for a stall  
He left that night on the cannonball  
Honey, oh honey, how long, will I have to wait?  
Oh, won't you tell me now, baby, why do you hesitate?
