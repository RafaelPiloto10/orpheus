On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket  
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock  
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?  
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots  
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not  
I've got no time to flick and talk  
But this baby rocked out on the spot  
She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot  
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop  
The killer had a case of tod the rock  
  
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,  
The Red Hots have baby appeal  
They dig a funky spiel, they'll make some spiel  
I say the Peppers have baby appeal  
The funk mobile is the one we wheel  
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal  
We serve those tots in the funk mobile  
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal  
  
We stop the fire, we quench the heat  
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street  
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?  
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat  
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet  
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat  
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street  
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!  
I just can't tell ya how much we did  
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out  
  
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,  
The Red Hots have baby appeal  
They dig a funky spiel, they'll make some spiel  
I say the Peppers have baby appeal  
The funk mobile is the one we wheel  
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal  
We serve those tots in the funk mobile  
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!  
  
Got the tunes in my pocket  
Baby appeal  
Rock out!...  
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili...  
Yes, we're called the Red...Hots...
