It was a rainy night when he came into sight  
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat  
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride  
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while  
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain  
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight  
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will you want me too  
All I want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well  
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily  
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note  
I told him I am the flower you are the seed  
We walked in the garden we planted a tree  
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare  
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
Oh, oooh, we made love  
Love like strangers  
All night long  
We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes  
I said please, please understand  
I'm in love with another man  
And what he couldn't give me  
was the one little thing that you can  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Come on, say you will, you want me too  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will, you want me too  
  
All night long...
