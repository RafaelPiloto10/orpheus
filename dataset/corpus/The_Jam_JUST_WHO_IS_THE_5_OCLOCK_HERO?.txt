Hello darlin' - I'm home again  
Covered in shit and aches and pains  
Too knackered to think so give me time to come round  
Just gimme the living room beat to the TV sound -  
  
My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder  
And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder!  
It seems a constant struggle just to exist  
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -  
  
From this window I've seen the whole world pass  
From dawn to dusk I've heard the last laugh laughed  
I've seen enough tears to wash away this street  
I've heard wedding bells chime and a funeral march  
  
When as one life finishes another one starts -  
Alright then love so I'll be off now  
It's back to the lunchbox and workermanagement rows  
There's gotta be more to this old life then this  
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -
