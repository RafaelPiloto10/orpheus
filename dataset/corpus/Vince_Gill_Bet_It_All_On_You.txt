It feels like you're at the bottom of an avalanche  
You sit and cry 'cause he don't ever wanna dance  
Give me the dice, give me half a chance with you, baby  
I look for you, just hoping you'll come in tonight  
With that fool, the one who never treats you right  
If you only knew how bad I burn inside for you, baby  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
I'd beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
I'll bet it all on you  
(Bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I think it's time for me to finally show my hand  
This heart of mine has taken all that it can stand  
But I ain't blind, I can see you want me too, baby  
Come on, let's make a run for the parking lot  
Can't wait, gotta give this thing a shot  
I know it's crazy but we ain't got a thing to lose  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
I'd beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
Oh, babe, I'll bet it all on you  
(Bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you, girl  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
Beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
I'll bet it all on you  
(I bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Oh, I'll bet it all on you, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you
