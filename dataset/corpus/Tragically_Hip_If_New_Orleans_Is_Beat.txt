Your smile is fading a bit, so I ration it  
Don't think about it  
Here where the Mississippi quits  
Where it's still got a bit of Minnesota in it  
No one will give you a thing these days  
They'd rather kill it or throw it away  
Don't 'do' dark American streets so  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, where does that leave you and me?  
The river takes, takes, takes and takes  
It doesn't change and only changes  
See it there in a picture with me  
There's a caption beneath, 'New Orleans is beat'  
And if New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Your smile is fading a bit so I ration it  
Don't think about it
