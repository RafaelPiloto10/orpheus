Here in this place lies the genie of death  
Touch it, see it  
Whoa  
Here in this place is a means to your end  
Touch it, feel it  
Green hell  
  
You've come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And don't you run away from anything  
I bet you thought you really could in hell  
  
We're gonna burn in hell  
Green hell  
Like every hell but kind of green  
In hell, green hell  
We're gonna face the mess we're  
In hell, green hell  
I think I'd rather be up here  
In hell, green hell  
You know I fucking shake apart  
In hell, green hell  
Gotta find a way that you will stay  
Green hell  
Cannot forget about the heat  
In hell, green hell  
Hell is green, I need a flame  
In hell, green hell  
Gotta burn in hell  
Green hell  
  
You've come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And don't you run from anything  
I bet you thought you really could take it  
  
Here in this place is the genie of death  
Touch it, see it  
Whoa  
Here in this place is the way to your end  
Touch it, feel it  
Green hell  
  
You've come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And don't you run away from anything  
I bet you thought you really could  
You've come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
We're gonna burn in Hell  
Green hell
