Blue morning Blue morning  
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone  
Curiosity, Kitten, doesn't have to mean you're on your own  
Your can look outside your window  
He doesn't have to know  
We can talk awhile, baby  
We can take it nice and slow  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
Are you happy where you're sleeping?  
Does he keep you safe and warm?  
Does he tell you when you're sorry?  
Does he tell you when you're wrong?  
I've been watching you for hours  
It's been years since we were born  
We were perfect when we started  
I've been wondering where we've gone  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow  
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows  
One for sorrow  
Two for joy  
Three for girls and four for boys  
Five for silver  
Six for gold and  
Seven for a secret never to be told  
  
There's a bird that nests inside you  
Sleeping underneath your skin  
When you open up your wings to speak  
I wish you'd let me in  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
Open up your eyes  
You can see the flames  
of your wasted life  
You should be ashamed  
  
You don't want to waste your life  
  
I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine  
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
