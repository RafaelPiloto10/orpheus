I was born across the river in the mountains where I call home.  
Lord, times were good there. don't know why i ever roamed.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we get together anytime we can.  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we play together in mother nature's  
  
Band.  
  
Me and my woman's done made our plans on the Tennessee river, walkin' hand in  
Hand.  
Gonna raise a family, lord settle down where peace and love can still be  
Found.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.
