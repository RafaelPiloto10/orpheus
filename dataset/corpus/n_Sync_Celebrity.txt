[Chorus]  
If I wasn't a celebrity,  
Would you be so nice to me,  
If I didn't have cheese like everyday,  
Would you still want to be with me,  
If I couldn't by you diamond rings and all those other expensive things,  
Would you be so into me,  
If I wasn't a celebrity?  
  
Lately, I done a little thinking about the things that saterfie you,  
Its making me wonder about the things that you do see in me,  
I hate the way you like to say,  
The mans a celebrity  
Baby, what's the deal,  
I thought you wanted me for me,  
(you gotta) say what you mean,  
(you gotta) mean what you say,  
(cause you keep) pusing me away,  
And I ain't got no time to play,  
So I say,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
  
(i bet) you,  
Having a good timeliving the life that I made out for me,  
Causin the splurges,  
Spendin my money on everything you see,  
It could be different,  
We could have something,  
Mabey like a j.o.b,  
  
You got to get your thing together,  
(you gotta) stop running me,  
(you say) it ain't about my fans,  
(cause you know) if things wern't this way,  
You'd be gone a long time ago,  
So I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you really loved me,  
You'd try to show me,  
It ain't even about my name,  
But you tried to use me,  
Lied to fool me,  
So we can never be the same,  
So now I'm leavin you behind,  
I've sombody who can love me for me,  
And someone I need,  
Yeah  
Oh  
  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
(celebrity, celebrity)  
If I wasn't a (celebrity, celebrity)  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
If I wasn't a celebrity (if I wasn't a celebrity)  
Would you be so nice to me ( would you still want to be with me)  
If I wasn't a, if I wasn't a, ohh  
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings,(could't buy no diamond rings)  
Expensive things (would you stillwanna be with me)  
  
Would you be so into me,  
If I wasn't a celebrity,  
Yeah
