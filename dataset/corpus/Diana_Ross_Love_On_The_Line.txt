When I don't see you  
And I don't know where you've been  
There gets to be a question in my mind  
It hurts to love you  
And the knife goes through the heart of me  
When you're gone I lose a part of me  
That's hard to find  
  
Don't want to fall asleep without you  
Don't want to wake  
Don't want to wake up when you're gone  
I don't know what you do that makes me love you  
But then love don't mean surrender  
And it's time I let it show  
You've got someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
You've been laying our  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
No ammunition  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
Some misty morning  
When she does the same to you  
When she makes you feel like I do  
That's the day  
But she can't have you  
She can't build a wall around you  
She can't love you like I love you anyway  
  
I know by midnight if you leave me  
And no lies can make the difference  
More hearts get broken now than need be  
And it's right to face the woman  
That steal the away man  
If there's anything to get you back  
That I must do I can  
And our love will never be  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
I'm on a mission  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
And my life I won't surrender  
And I'll find out where you go  
There's someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
And it's dying in the heart of me  
And our love should never be  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
No ammunition  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
I'm on a mission  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed
