We got licked, just a bit, right outside the show  
The T stripped, then your manners flew right out the door  
It's like this, who you keep texting on the phone?  
It's like that, I'm not the only one with whoops to owe  
It's automatic, don't you point your finger at me  
It's so tragic, you should be a Kennedy  
It's automatic, pulling me like gravity  
You're putting me down, pulling me down six feet  
Hate me, hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me, break me  
Go on and shatter me 'cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me, hate me  
Call it a victory but you'll see lately, not going easily  
'Cause I'm not falling down and you won't get the best of me now  
A fat lip, finger flip and an insult to go  
The record skips, you got issues like a girl in porn  
It's like this, you act crazy from tour to four  
It's like that, I can't take all of the blame no more  
It's automatic, don't you point your finger at me  
It's so tragic, you should be a Kennedy  
It's automatic, pulling me like gravity  
You're putting me down, pulling me down six feet  
Hate me, hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me, break me  
Go on and shatter me 'cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me, hate me  
Call it a victory but you'll see lately, not going easily  
'Cause I'm not falling down and you won't get the best of me now  
I didn't wanna get into another battle, hey, hey  
I didn't wanna make the claws and bones rattle, hey, hey  
I didn't wanna get into another battle, hey, hey  
It's automatic how you throw it all away  
So hate me now  
You can't break me down  
So just hate me now  
You can't break me down  
And you can hate me, hate me  
Tell me what thought would make you break me, break me  
Go on and shatter me 'cause lately you run me into the ground  
And you can hate me, hate me  
Call it a victory but you'll see lately, not going easily  
'Cause I'm not falling down and you won't get the best of me now  
It's automatic, hey, hey  
It's so tragic, hey, hey  
It's automatic
