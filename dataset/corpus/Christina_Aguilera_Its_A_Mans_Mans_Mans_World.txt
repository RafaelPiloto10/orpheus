This is a man's world, this is a man's world  
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
You see, man made the cars to take us over the road  
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads  
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark  
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark  
  
This is a man's world, this is a man's world  
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
Man thinks about little baby boy and baby girl  
Man makes them happy cause man makes them toys  
And after man has made everything, everything he can  
You know that man makes money to buy from other man  
  
This is a man's world  
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
He's lost in the wilderness  
He's lost in bitterness
