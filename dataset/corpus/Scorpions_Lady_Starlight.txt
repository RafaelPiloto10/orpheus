Walking through a winter night,  
Counting the stars  
And passing time  
I dream about the summer days,  
Love in the sun  
And lonely bays  
  
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away  
Like our love,  
On one of these lonely winter nights  
  
Dreaming through a winter night,  
Memories of you are passing by  
It seems to me like yesterday  
I think you knew I couldn't stay  
  
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away  
Like our love  
Lady starlight, help me to find my love  
Lady starlight, help me tonight  
Help me to find my love  
  
Walking through a winter night,  
Counting the stars  
And passing time  
Snow dances with the wind  
I wish, I could be with you again  
  
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away  
Like our love  
Lady starlight, help me to find my love  
Lady starlight, help me tonight  
Help me to find my love  
  
Lady starlight, help me tonight  
Help me to find my love  
  
Lady starlight, help me tonight  
Help me to find my love
