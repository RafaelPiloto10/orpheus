You say you don't need me  
I know where your love goes  
You go missing after midnight  
I should know better and the bed is cold  
And if you think I'm not the real thing  
I don't want to die of hunger  
I got my world created for you  
But you don't stay  
Not my imagination no more  
I can't be dealing with the bad girl  
Lives in your head  
You got your someone I , don't cry  
You go and take a strangers love instead  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
You know I love the way you do it  
When you do it right  
You ain't no one man woman  
Were you ever  
If you don't come back running  
When you've had enough  
And baby , you got it , I want it  
Show me what's left of your love  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
I won't be no dirty weekend  
I stay with you for good  
He can be your outside lover  
I've got eyes  
I know he's in your blood  
Just let me hold you for the hour  
I go where you lead me  
I need some inspiration from you  
I'm ready for the mystery , take me  
Don't let me fall  
Don't let me drown down here in the rain  
There is no alibi , don't lie  
You love a stranger and the world is pain  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)
