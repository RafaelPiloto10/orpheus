People die laughing upon the ground  
They don't know why they fall  
I have got nothing, at least so I say  
Got my song and my music that's all  
People look worried crowding around  
Messing around with their dreams  
Tomorrow they'll wake up in a new life  
And they'll start all over again  
Because tomorrow is the first day  
Of the rest of your life  
You just remember when you're worried  
Everything is gonna be alright  
Ah yes tomorrow is the first day  
Of the rest of your life  
You just remember when you're worried  
Everything is gonna be alright  
Come on you people all over the world  
Realise you're one and the same  
Tomorrow you'll wake up in a new life  
And you'll start all over again, oh yes you will  
Oh yes tomorrow is the first day  
Of the rest of your life  
Look you just remember when you're worried  
Everything is gonna be alright  
Oh yes tomorrow is the first day  
Of the rest of your life  
You just remember when you're worried  
Everything is gonna be alright  
Yes everything is gonna be alright  
Yes everything has gotta be alright  
Everything  
Is gonna be alright
