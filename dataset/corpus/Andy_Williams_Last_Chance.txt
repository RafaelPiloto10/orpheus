Slow dance, last chance  
Time for romance  
Someone needs somebody  
Someone wants to share  
  
When a heart find each other  
Oh, love will be there  
It's a part of a game  
That's as old as the rain  
  
Slow dance, last chance  
One move, one glance  
And love took me over  
When I took your hand  
  
And I pull you closer, so you understand  
If you're lonely tonight  
Won't you please hold me tight  
It's a slow dance, last chance  
  
If you're lonely tonight  
Won't you please hold me tight  
It's a slow dance, last chance
