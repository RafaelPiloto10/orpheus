When I wonder where I am  
When I wonder why I take these chances  
I try to breathe  
I say to me, "believe"  
And whatever comes, it's okay  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm further every day  
I'm on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So I'm on my way  
To find that place  
  
People say that I'm naive  
'Cause I'm trusting and my heart is open  
But I won't hide  
I'm here to find who I am  
And whatever comes is what's right  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm further every day  
I'm on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So I'm on my way  
To find that place  
  
I'll keep dreamin'  
Til I get there  
I'll be free  
So goodbye to yesterday  
I'm giving what it takes  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm on my way  
It could take forever  
(And everything could change)  
It could change today  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To find that place
