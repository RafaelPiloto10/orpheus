From time to time they cry  
Only if you know why  
Here they go  
  
A hundred thousand people  
Walking down the streets  
Trying to protect their dream  
Following their feet  
They're busy, lost  
Can't find anyone  
They're looking for a disguise  
And the stars could come  
No more!  
No tears  
Just cries, and fears  
I don't believe it  
Look at them  
I really can't believe it  
Look at them  
They're fucking crazy  
Hey! Just, ha ha ha ha!  
I can't believe it  
Look at them  
All right, all right  
All right folks  
This was today's show time  
And now go home!  
See you tomorrow  
Same time, same place  
Take care
