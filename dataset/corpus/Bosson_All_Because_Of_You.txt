Chorus  
It's all because of you  
Yeah you  
It's all because of you  
Nobody else makes me feel like you do  
I have the time of my life  
And it's all because of you  
If I was able to thank you  
For coming into my life  
If I was able to tell the whole world how I feel  
My love is for real  
If I was able to write a song  
I would have filled it with love  
If I was able to open my heart you would see  
I'm so happy  
Chorus  
If I was able to live my life (over again)  
I'd share the minutes with you  
If I was able to count the times you bring out the sun  
When I'm feeling down  
If I was able to explain  
How you have opened my eyes  
I sure have tried about thousand times  
I just feel so alive  
Chorus (2x)  
I found the meaning  
I cherish my life  
Now I see everything in colors so bright  
And when it's raining  
I still feel the sun  
So take a good look  
I'm walking clouds  
Chorus
