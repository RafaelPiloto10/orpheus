Now it's so clear  
what i always feared  
to walk that lonely road  
without you  
and thou I'm afraid  
it's never too late  
now's the time to make our dreams come true  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on  
forever one  
I hear the angels calling out your name  
I felt so low  
as the days turned cold  
I know our love  
will conquer all  
you walked into my life  
I was born again  
now's the time to make our dreams come true  
forever one  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on  
forever one  
I hear the angels calling out your name  
forever one  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on.
