Them dead presidents  
Them dead presidents  
Well I ain't broke but I'm badly bent  
Everybody loves them dead presidents  
A little bit of Lincoln can't park the car  
Washington he can't go too far  
Jefferson is good, played the track  
If you think you're gonna bring some big bitch back  
  
Them dead presidents  
Hamilton on a ten can get you straight  
But Jackson on a twenty is really great  
And if you're talkin' about a poor man's friend  
Grant will get you out of whatever you're in  
Them dead presidents  
  
A hundred dollar Franklin is really sweet  
A five hundred McKinley is the one for me  
If I get a Cleveland I'm really set  
A thousand dollar Cleveland is hard to get  
Them dead presidents
