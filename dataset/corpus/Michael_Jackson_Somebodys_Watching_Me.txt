(Who's watching)  
(Tell me who's watching)  
(Who's watching me)  
  
I'm just an average man  
With an average life  
I work from nine to five  
Hey, hey, I'll pay the price  
  
All I want is to be left alone  
In my average home  
But why do I always feel like  
I'm in the twilight zone  
And  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream  
  
When I come home at night  
I bold the door real tight  
People call me on the phone  
I'm trying to avoid  
But can people on TV see me  
Or am I just paranoid  
  
When I'm in the shower  
I'm afraid to wash my hair  
'Cause I might open my eyes  
And find someone standing there  
  
People say I'm crazy  
Just a little touched  
But maybe showers remind me  
Of Psycho too much  
That's why  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me  
  
(Who's watching me)  
I don't know anymore  
Are the neighbors watching me  
Well, is the mail man watching me  
(Tell me who's watching)  
And I don't feel safe anymore  
Oh, what a mess  
I wonder who's watching me now  
(Who)  
The IRS  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me who can it be  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me  
  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Can I have my privacy
