Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside  
Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma  
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn  
My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night  
She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out  
Amongst the trees when a shot rang low and left her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Father have mercy, get her a nurse please, she's almost alone  
I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone, we rather see her  
Locked up inside a home than see her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in the pale moonlight light  
Light light lie lie lie lie  
Too long in the hot sun, she could've be miss Wisconsin  
A long time ago, spent to much time inside of the early show  
We'd bought her a ticket but she didn't want to go she was standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing, caught a skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in through the pale moonlight  
Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside  
Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma  
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn  
My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night  
She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out  
Amongst the trees, when a shot rang low and left her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road
