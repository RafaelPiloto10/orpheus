Baby relax we've been waiting for this,  
And we deserve the heavenly bliss  
That waits underneath the stars above  
Can't you hear them begging us (let's make love)  
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul  
Right here is this room the truth unfolds  
  
(It's saying) Saying  
(Stop playing) Playing  
Delaying the divine  
The pleasure is mine, let me give some to you,  
We can take our time (take our time)  
Nothing I'd rather do (oh no)  
Make ya feel fine (fine)  
Make ya life shine (shine)  
Give you moments you can treasure...  
Forever (forever) remember (remember)  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine  
  
Every-day I been dreaming about  
How it's gonna be, to find you out,  
To be sharing your kiss  
To be just like this  
What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips  
So lets not waste one second more  
Lets cut the lights and lets lock the door  
  
(It's saying) Saying  
(Stop playing) Playing  
Delaying the divine  
The pleasure is mine, let me give some to you,  
We can take our time (take our time)  
Nothing I'd rather do (oh no)  
Than make ya feel fine (fine)  
Make ya life shine (shine)  
Give you moments you can treasure  
Forever (forever) remember (remember)  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine,  
The pleasure is mine  
  
Oh baby I don't wanna breathe (I don't wanna)  
Don't wanna change a single thing (don't wanna)  
Nobody else I'd rather see (nobody else)  
Than you like this before my eyes  
Wanna be everything you need  
Keep you satisfied  
I'm praying (I'm praying)  
Stop playing (stop playing)  
  
(It's saying) Saying  
(Stop playing) Playing  
Ahhhh ahah ahh ahh  
The pleasure is mine (all mine yeah)  
Let me give some to you,  
We can take our time (take our time)  
Nothing I'd rather do (rather do)  
Make ya feel fine (fine)  
Make ya life shine (shine)  
Give you moments you can treasure  
Forever (forever) forever (forever) remember (remember)  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine  
The pleasure is mine, mine mine all mine,  
The pleasure is mine
