I'm mean and I'm dirty, like none you've ever seen  
Bad habits drip like honey, no tongue can lick me clean  
I'm not of royal blood, I've never been discreet  
Better lock up your daughters, we're comin' to your town  
We're here for the slaughter, kick you when you're down  
Kick you when you're down  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're not for the innocent, we're not for the innocent  
We're not for the innocent, let the beast run wild  
  
I've been damned, I've been cursed, I've been guilty and abused  
I spit the hangman in his face and hung him on his noose  
Habitual threat, I got you in my claws  
  
Gonna tan your hide, rip the flesh off your bones  
Look me in the eye, and you're gonna turn to stone  
You're gonna turn to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better lock up your daughters, we're comin' to your town  
Better pray we're not around  
  
Let the beast run wild  
  
[Chorus]
