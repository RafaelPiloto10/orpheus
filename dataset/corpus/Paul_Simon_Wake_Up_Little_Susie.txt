Wake up, little Susie, wake up  
Wake up, little Susie, wake up  
We've both been sound asleep, wake up, little Susie, and weep  
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie, well  
  
Whatta we gonna tell your mama  
Whatta we gonna tell your pa  
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say "ooh-la-la"  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie, well  
  
I told your mama that you'd be in by ten  
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie, we gotta go home  
  
Wake up, little Susie, wake up  
Wake up, little Susie, wake up  
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot  
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie, well  
  
Whatta we gonna tell your mama  
Whatta we gonna tell your pa  
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say "ooh-la-la"  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie  
Wake up little Susie
