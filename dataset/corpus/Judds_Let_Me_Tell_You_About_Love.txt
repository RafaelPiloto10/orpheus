Well ever since the day that time began  
There's been this thing 'tween a woman and a man  
We'll, I don't know but I do believe  
It started in the garden with Adam and Eve  
Sampson and Delilah had their fling  
'Til she cut his hair and clipped his wing  
It don't matter how the story's told  
Love stays young it can't grow old  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me tell you about love  
About the moon and stars above  
It's what we've all been dreamin' of  
Let me tell you about love  
  
Well, Bonaparte and Josephine  
I believe they had a pretty good scene  
Until she said Bonnie boy, we're through  
That's when he met his Waterloo  
Julie baby and Romeo  
Fell in love and stole the show  
I know they are history  
But there ain't been nothin' like you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Sheba she was a beauty queen  
The purtiest thing that you ever have seen  
Solomon he was a mighty wise  
Sheba she done caught his eye  
The world would be in a dreadful fix  
If it wasn't for the love between the cats and chicks  
The world wouldn't amount to much  
Without a hug and a kiss and a tender touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me tell you about love  
Let me tell you about love  
Yeah
