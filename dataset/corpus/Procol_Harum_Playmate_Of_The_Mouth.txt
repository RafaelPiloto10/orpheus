Sceptic at the feast in ashes  
Huntsman at the voyeurs ball  
Funeral Parlour-Guests invited  
Mourning poorly worn by all  
Old and mouldy words of passion  
Savage Rose destroyed them all  
Wrote her fate in Neon captions  
Slender sender made me crawl  
Playmate of the mouth expected  
Passionata bless the small  
Baby sandwich soaped for comfort  
Slipp'ry Sliding Ten Feet Tall  
(Gary Brooker-Keith Reid)
