All right, you sinners, swing!  
Danger in the rear view mirror  
There's trouble in the wind  
Badness bringing up the rear  
The menace's loose again  
She looks so fuckin' good  
So sexy and so frail  
Something got the bite on me  
I'm goin' straight to hell  
And now we're wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Don't waste time  
Come back to your senses, baby  
We can come to terms  
I can almost taste it  
It burns  
You'd be sitting pretty  
But you try to take the Fifth  
Wearin' out my welcome  
Guess I better say my prayers  
And now we're wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Don't waste time  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Soon you'll see my silhouette  
Darkenin' your door  
I can almost taste it  
I want more  
No one's above suspicion  
No one's got it wired  
I'll eat with my fingers  
Want my iron in that fire  
And now we're wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Don't waste time  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push  
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
