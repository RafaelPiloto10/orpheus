He's got something  
I don't know what but it's grand  
I can feel it each time he touches my hand  
  
When we walk  
When we talk  
Yeah  
I feel so fine  
He's got something  
And it's mine, all mine  
  
He's got something  
I feel it each time we kiss  
And he thrills me  
Each time he holds me like this  
  
When we part  
Breaks my heart  
I miss him so  
He's got something  
Only lovers know  
  
He's got something  
It's so fine  
He's got something  
Mine, all mine  
He's got something  
I miss him so  
He's got something  
Only lovers know  
Yeah  
  
He's got something  
I don't know what but it's grand  
I can feel it each time he touches my hand  
  
When we walk  
When we talk  
Yeah  
I feel so fine  
He's got something  
And it's mine, all mine  
  
When we part  
Breaks my heart  
Yeah  
I miss him so  
He's got something  
Only lovers know  
  
He's got something only lovers know, oh
