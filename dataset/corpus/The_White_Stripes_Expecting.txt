Your mouth said this never  
But your fingers have shown me  
Your head is so clever  
You claim that you own me  
Forever, forever, forever, forever  
  
You have the right to conduct me  
In whatever fashion  
Your attempt to construct me  
In the interest of passion  
You sent me  
To Toledo, Toledo, Toledo  
  
I came back with handfuls  
I did what you asked me  
But after the thank yous  
That you quickly got passed me  
I'm expected  
You're expecting  
I'm expected  
Expected
