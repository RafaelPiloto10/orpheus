The witching hour has arrived here too soon  
I know that all my dreams are inside this room  
Oh yeah, it's all in this tune  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
  
They cannot wait until I turn off the light  
When I'm asleep they've got the key to my mind  
Oh yeah, can't leave them behind  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night.  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me another dream now  
  
The Spider's lullaby is all they can sing  
As they inject their poison into my brain  
Oh yeah, they're calling my name  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
  
Give me another dream now  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me another dream now  
  
Rainbows and waterfalls  
Little girls are swimming in a pond of gold  
I'm growing old  
I'm growing old  
Sweet blue eyes of innocence  
Begging me  
To follow them to the other side  
Ah, they're growing horns  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night  
  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams,  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams
