I've heard there's talk around sayin' I'm out of control.  
Something about too many bottles and a love that's grown cold.  
But you know talk is cheap and sometime these stories get old.  
But I keep on singing my songs and I still got some soul.  
  
[Chorus]  
So Dream On if you think I still carry the flame.  
Dream On if you think that I still feel the same.  
Your love is just an old memory.  
And I'm alright you don't have to worry 'bout me.  
  
I've spent my whole life going the way that I choose.  
And I've tried to find a way where no one could see.  
And it seems unkind to know that maybe I've done it all wrong.  
When I see my life flashing before me sometimes in these songs.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
