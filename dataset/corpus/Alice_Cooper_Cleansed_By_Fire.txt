I don't know but I've been told  
The streets of hell are paved with gold  
Crazy, crazy  
You told me that nothing's free  
Except my own insanity  
Crazy, maybe  
Wake me, shake me  
Wake me, shake me  
  
You offer me the world and all its wealth  
All for myself  
You promised me a life eternally  
And drink to my health  
I may seem only half-glued  
But I can see right through you  
  
Burn it up, burn it down  
Burn this sucker to the ground  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Going, going, going, gone  
There's a party going on  
And on, and on, and on  
  
Do you think I don't know who you are  
A fallen star  
When I feel my soul scream out at night  
I know you're not far  
You need a better disguise  
This one won't win any prize  
  
Burn it up, burn it down  
Burn this sucker to the ground  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Going, going, going, gone  
There's a party going on  
And on, and on, and on  
  
Cleansed by fire, cleansed by fire  
I may seem only half-glued  
But I can see right through you  
  
What about dark  
What about light  
What about wrong  
What about right  
What about death  
What about sin  
What about the web you're trying to spin  
  
What about truth  
What about life  
What about glory  
What about Christ  
What about peace  
What about love  
What about faith in God above  
What about war  
What about hell  
What if I stumble  
What if I fell  
What about blood  
What about greed  
And all of these things you're offering me  
  
Yeah, what about me, little me  
You lose and I win  
You couldn't suck me in  
It's over, you have no power  
You're lost  
And I'm found  
And I'm Heaven bound  
Go back to where you belong  
To where you fell  
Go to hell
