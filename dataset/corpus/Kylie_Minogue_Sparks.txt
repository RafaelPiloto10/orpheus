Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
  
Sometimes the love that you wasted  
Becomes the love that you've lost  
A moment feels like a life time  
Cry cry cry, you can't stop  
Just when I feel no ignition  
No one but me understands  
Arms reach out from a distance  
Palm to palm, touch your hands  
  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
  
You know that you are a fighter  
But you feel yourself fall apart  
Now you're just panicing because you're left defeated  
And you see nothing but dark  
But when my soul is in pieces  
No one but me understands  
Arms reach out from a distance  
Palm to palm, touch your hands  
  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out  
Oh, feels like you light me up  
Feels like you light me up  
When the sparks run out
