Now, in this faraway land  
Strange, that the palms of my hands  
Should be damp with expectancy  
  
Spring, and the air's turning mild  
City lights, and the glimpse of a child  
Of the alleyway infantry  
  
Friends, do they know what I mean  
Rain, and the gathering green  
Of an afternoon out-of-town  
  
But Lord I had to go  
My trail was laid too slow behind me  
To face the call of fame  
Or make a drunkard's name for me  
Though now this other life  
Has brought a different understanding  
And from these endless days  
Shall come a broader sympathy  
And though I count the hours  
To be alone's no injury  
  
My home, was a place near the sand  
Cliffs, and a military band  
Blew and air of normality
