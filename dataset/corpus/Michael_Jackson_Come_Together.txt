Here come ol' flat top  
He come groovin' up slowly  
He's got Joo Joo eyeball  
He one holy roller  
He got hair down to his knees  
Got to be a joker he just do what he please  
  
He wear no shoeshine  
He's got toe jam football  
He's got monkey finger  
He shoot Coca-Cola  
He say "I know you, you know me"  
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free  
  
Come together right now over me  
  
He bag production  
He's got walrus gum-boot  
He's got Ono sideboard  
He one spinal cracker  
He got feet down through his knees  
Hold you in his armchair  
You can feel his disease  
  
Come together right now over me  
  
He roller coaster  
He's got early warning  
He's got muddy water  
He one Mojo filter  
He say "One and one and one is three"  
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see  
  
Come together right now over me
