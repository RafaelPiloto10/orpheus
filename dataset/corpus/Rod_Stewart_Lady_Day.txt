North winds have made my face a little older  
And my back is bent through trying too hard  
My vest is torn so I make no perfect picture  
To place upon your white-washed wall  
I'd like to stay but you have not asked me  
Still I don't really expect you to  
Dusty boots would shame you now Lady Day  
Are we really that far apart  
I wish the world could see you now Lady Day  
Laughing down at your oldest friend  
The one who shared just about all he had  
In a one-sided love affair  
I get scared when I remember too much  
  
Wasted time I suppose you could say that  
Strange it don't seem that way to me  
But wait a minute  
I don't even think you're listening  
Just let me tell you how I really feel  
I've seen the inside of your heart Lady Day  
When you wanted to be shown the way  
I loved you then as I love ya now girl
