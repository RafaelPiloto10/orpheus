It's time for forgiveness.  
It's time for relief.  
It's time that we've wasted.  
It's time that we need.  
It's time for decision.  
It's time to be brave.  
It's the time of your life,  
Don't let it slip away yeah  
  
Boy,  
You'll be running but can't get anywhere  
Don't carry the weight of the world  
Boy  
  
It's time that we borrow.  
It's time that we bleed.  
It's time that will cure us.  
You just gotta believe, yeah  
There's a warning up ahead,  
The alarms gone off again,  
But the sun will fill the sky,  
Fill the sky  
  
Boy,  
You'll be running but can't get anywhere  
Don't carry the weight of the world  
And boy,  
Help is coming, I'll get you out of here.  
Don't carry the weight of the world,  
The weight of the world, the weight of the world  
  
Just when you think you're done,  
What can ever be won?  
I'll be there to pick you up, and dust you off,  
And bring you home, and make you feel,  
Alive.  
  
Don't carry the weight of the world  
And boy,  
You'll be running but can't get anywhere  
Don't carry the weight of the world  
And boy,  
Help is coming, I'll get you out of here.  
Don't carry the weight of the world,  
The weight of the world,  
And the weight of the world  
The weight of the world,  
And the weight of the world  
  
Tonight, is a fireball,  
And tonight, oh you're not alone  
And tonight, we start again,  
Tonight, all the best is yet,  
To come.
