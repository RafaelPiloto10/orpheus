If only I could find a way to say the words  
I've kept for a long time  
Oh if only I could stay to make you  
Feel the way I do  
With us not parting I can  
  
If only I could let you know  
I love you so  
Oh I love you so much  
Oh if only I could find a way  
To say it easily  
Oh god, please let it be  
  
If only we could have more time  
To learn, to love, to know our feelings  
If only time could slow down and in every minute  
We are in each other's arms  
Oh if only  
Oh if only I can  
  
Adlib  
  
If only we could have more time  
To learn, to love, to know our feelings  
If only time could slow down and in every minute  
We are in each other's arms  
Oh if only  
Oh if only I can...
