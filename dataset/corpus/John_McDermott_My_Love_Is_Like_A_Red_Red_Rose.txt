O, my love is like a red, red rose  
That's newly sprung in June  
O, my love is like a melody  
That's sweetly played in tune  
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still  
My dear till a' the seas gang dry  
Till a' the seas gang dry my dear  
And the rocks melt wi' the sun  
And I will love thee still, my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
And fare thee weel, my only love  
And fare thee weel awhile  
And I will come again, my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand mile  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles  
And I will come again, my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles
