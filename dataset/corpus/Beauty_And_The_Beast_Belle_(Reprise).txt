Belle  
  
Is he gone?  
Oh, can you imagine?  
He asked me to marry him.  
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless. ..  
  
"Madame Gaston!"  
Can't you just see it?  
"Madame Gaston!"  
His "little wife", ugh!  
No sir! Not me! I guarantee it!  
I want much more than this provincial life!  
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere  
I want it more than I can tell  
And for once it might be grand  
To have someone understand  
I want so much more than they've got planned
