There's a beautiful home, far over the sea  
There are mansions of bliss, for you and for me  
Oh, that beautiful home, so wonderf'ly fair  
That the savior for me, has gone to prepare.  
  
Chorus: (echo first part of each line, part with " marks)  
"There's a beautiful home", far over the sea  
"There's a beautifu home", for you and for me  
"And it's glittering pow'r", the sun outshines  
"And that beautiful home", someday shall be mine.  
  
In that beautiful home, a crown I shall wear  
When the glorified throne, that glory to share  
But the joys of that home, can never be known  
'Till the savior we see, upon his white throne.  
  
Chorus: (echo first part of each line, part with " marks)  
"There's a beautiful home", far over the sea  
"There's a beautifu home", for you and for me  
"And it's glittering pow'r", the sun outshines  
"And that beautiful home", someday shall be mine...
