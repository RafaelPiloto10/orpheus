Strung out on the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest pleasure  
In two days time I'll be given a sign  
That puts me in a place I get high  
  
Meanwhile there's no reply, it's a one conversation  
In two days time I'll be given a sign  
That puts me with the stars in the sky  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I can't see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know, I'll be  
  
Counting down the headlights  
Brings me down to earth  
2 days after midnite baby  
I'll be there  
  
Strung out on the edge of the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest pleasure  
In two days time, I'll leave it behind  
And put it in a place I can find  
  
Meantime I'm drawing the line, it's a no win situation  
In two days time I'll get the sign  
Scaring myself outa my mind  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I can't see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know, I'll be there  
  
Counting down the headlights  
Brings me down to earth  
2 days after midnight baby  
I'll be there  
  
If I disappear, that would make it clear  
Strung out on the edge on the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest measure  
Freaking out on this sensation  
Guarantees my destination  
  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I can't see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know, I'll be there  
  
Counting down... repeat to fade
