I took my baby on a river boat cruise  
And she was well aware  
I was excited about the way things could have been  
Cause in it I don't care  
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise  
Someone called out my name  
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab  
My joy has turned to pain  
  
Father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain!  
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame  
So don't you ever complain!  
  
I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene  
They know my every do's  
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine" ?  
That always bothers me  
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind  
Someone is following you  
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad  
They know your every move!  
  
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!  
  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame  
So don't you ever complain!  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain!  
  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!  
Father never lies, my father never lies  
My father never lies  
So don't be feelin' this way boy!  
  
I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say  
Is that boy still alive?  
The week in village what a thrill  
Only the strong survive  
  
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?  
I feel their envious looks at me  
Their mistaken jealousy  
Then stand here in my shoes  
And then get a taste of my blues!  
  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' this way!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain!  
  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!  
Father never lies, my father never lies baby  
My father never lies  
So don't be feelin' no pain boy!
