You're taking the fun out of everything  
You're making me run, when I don't want to think  
You're taking the fun out of everything  
I don't want to think at all  
  
[Chorus]  
There's no other way  
There's no other way  
All that you can do is watch them play  
  
You're taking the fun out of everything  
You're making it clear, when I don't want to think  
You're taking me up, when I don't want to go up anymore  
I'm just watching it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll watch you play  
I'll watch you play  
  
[Chorus]
