Smother his life, the words cut right to the heart  
Disease and threaten my family name  
An epic stand is made, condemned  
I will not plead, I will not plead  
  
Damned to the beast of torment  
Damned by the beast within us all  
  
Crushed by the fear  
More stone, more stone  
More weight for Corey  
  
Not one step forth could capture a mission of guilt  
By law, avoids death on gallows hill  
Through time, his fight will martyr my name  
My soul free of a heretic  
  
Crushed by the fear  
More stone, more stone  
More weight for Corey  
  
Court of ayer and terminer  
Leave me my rightful land  
Court of ayer and terminer  
Leave me my rightful land  
To stow in my heart, leave to my sons  
  
Peine forte et dure is called  
An effort to collapse belief has failed  
And surely will die with me  
An epic stand is made, condemned  
I will not plead, I will not plead  
  
Damned to the beast of torment  
Damned by the beast within us all  
  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name
