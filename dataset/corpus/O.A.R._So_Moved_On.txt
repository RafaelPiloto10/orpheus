I woke today, felt another way,  
Everything was gonna be fine.  
My head rose up then my legs came too,  
Quarter past nine was the time.  
  
I used to lose floating memories, found myself  
Wishing I'd remember old times.  
But I woke today,  
Felt another way,  
  
Felt free in the sky to fly.  
I stepped out the door, didn't know what for,  
I saw my lady walking along.  
I could have cried out what I wanted to say,  
  
But I am sick of all this terrible charm.  
I used to be into apologies, a regular to shame I  
Was shy.  
But I woke today,  
  
Felt another way,  
Felt free in the sky to fly.  
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about  
A quarter to eight.  
  
And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and  
Just think.  
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same  
Anymore.  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day.  
The morning dragged on, I was walking along,  
Missing pieces fell to the ground.  
  
Apparently, I could not see,  
But I saw everything going down.  
So I packed my bags and I was on my way,  
I feel a little different in a different way.  
  
But like I said when I got out of bed, I was off to a  
Regular day.  
I could not hide, I wore my pride,  
It felt good to be on the run.  
  
The air quality was something new to me and I got  
Along fine with the sun.  
And when I rest my heard and I lay down to bed,  
I put the pieces down with the blame.  
  
And if all goes well, at the morning bell,  
I'll wake feeling free just the same.  
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about  
A quarter to eight.  
  
And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and  
Just think.  
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same  
Anymore.  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day.
