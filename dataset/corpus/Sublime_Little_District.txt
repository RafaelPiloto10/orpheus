Oh, in a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast to your lips  
And later you move and slip  
And if you have to don't trip  
  
I don't know how they manage  
But believe me Mister, they do  
If you ever live there  
You just listen and don't be no fool  
  
In a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
Later you move and trip  
If you have to just slip  
  
No one ask no question  
No one tell no lie  
Listen to me people  
It's the reason why  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
And later you move and trip  
And if you have to just slip  
  
I don't know how they manage  
But believe me, Mister, they do  
If you ever live there  
You just listen and don't be no fool  
  
In a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
Later you move and trip
