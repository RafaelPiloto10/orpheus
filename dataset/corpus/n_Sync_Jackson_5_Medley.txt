Oh  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
I'm gonna tell you now, oh, oh  
When I had you to myself I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch one glance is all it took  
And now it's much too late for me to take a second look  
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go  
Let you go, baby  
And now when I've seen you it is on  
I want you back  
Yes I know now  
I want you back  
Ooh ooh baby  
  
A B C  
It's easy as  
1 2 3  
As simple as  
Do re mi  
A B C  
That's how easy love can be  
Chris You went to school to learn girl  
Never ever knew before  
Like 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'  
Why two plus two makes four  
Now, now, now  
I'm gonna teach you  
Teach you, teach you  
All about love girl  
All about love  
Sit yourself down and take a seat  
Cuz all you gotta do is repeat after me  
A B C  
It's easy as  
1 2 3  
As simple as  
Do re mi  
A B C  
That's how easy love can be  
Do do do do do do...  
  
Stop!  
You'd better sing it  
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better sing it  
We played tag in grade school  
You wanted to be It  
Chasing boys was just a fad  
You crossed your heart you'd quit  
Now and back in grade school  
I promised you a ring  
Just like back in grade school  
You're doing the same old thing  
Stop! The love you save may be your own  
Darling, take it slow  
Or some day you'll be all alone  
  
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own  
Darling, look both ways before you cross me  
Headed for the danger zone  
All Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
S is for Save it  
T is fortake it slow  
O is for Oh, no  
P is for Please, please, don't go  
The love you save may be your own  
Some day you may be all alone  
All Hold on  
Hold on  
Stop
