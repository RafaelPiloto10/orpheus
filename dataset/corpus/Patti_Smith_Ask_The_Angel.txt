Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,  
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee  
Ask the angels while they're falling  
Who that person could possibly be  
And I know you got the feeling,  
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor  
And I know it got you reelin'  
And honey honey the call is for war  
And it's wild wild wild wild.  
Everybody got the feelin'  
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day  
Everybody wants to be reelin'  
And baby baby I'll show you the way  
And I know it's hard sometimes,  
You got a piece and hit across the sky  
And I know it's hard sometimes  
And world war is the battle cry  
And it's wild wild wild wild  
Across the country through the fields  
You know I see it written 'cross the sky  
People rising from the highway  
And war war is the battle cry  
And it's wild wild wild wild.  
Armageddon, it's gotten  
No savior jailer can take it from me  
World ending, it's just beginning  
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be  
And it's wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3  
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move  
Comin' in droves in from L.A.  
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove  
Lightning as armor and it's today  
It's wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3
