Winter has me in it's grip  
Think I'll take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand  
  
I feel so lonely  
I'm to young to feel this old  
I need you and you only  
When the weather gets this cold. That's why  
  
Winter has me in it's grip  
Think I'll take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand  
  
There's no use in going  
Cause it's cold inside my heart  
And it's always snowing  
Since the day we broke apart.  
  
Winter has me in it's grip  
Think I'll take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand.  
  
I tried to run from winter  
Like this spring and summer run to fall  
But when the weather's in you  
There's no hiding place at all, that's why  
  
Winter has me in it's grip  
Think I'll take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand.
