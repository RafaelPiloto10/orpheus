Take my hand, take a breath  
Pull me close and take one step  
Keep your eyes locked on mine  
And let the music be your guide  
  
Won't you promise me?  
(Now won't you promise me?)  
(That you'll never forget)  
We'll keep dancing  
(To keep dancing)  
Wherever we go next  
  
It's like catching lightning, the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance?  
(Can I have this dance?)  
Can I have this dance?  
  
Take my hand, I'll take the lead  
And every turn will be safe with me  
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall  
You know I'll catch you through it all  
  
And you can't keep us apart  
(Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)  
'Cause my heart is wherever you are  
  
It's like catching lightening, the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance?  
(Can I have this dance?)  
Can I have this dance?  
  
Oh, no mountain's too high and no ocean's too wide  
'Cause together or not, our dance won't stop  
Let it rain, let it pour, what we have is worth fighting for  
You know I believe that we were meant to be! Oh!  
  
It's like catching lightening, the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance?  
(Can I have this dance?)  
Can I have this dance?  
Can I have this dance?  
Can I have this dance?
