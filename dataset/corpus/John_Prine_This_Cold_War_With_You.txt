The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why, oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Who's cold, cold wars are never done  
And hearts just can't be free  
So, let's do right  
Or let's just say we're through  
I just can't stand  
Another cold, cold war with you  
The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why, oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Who's cold, cold wars are never done  
And hearts just can't be free  
So, let's do right  
Or let's just say we're through  
I just can't stand  
Another cold, cold war with you
