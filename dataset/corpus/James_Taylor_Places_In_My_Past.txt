There are ladies in my life,  
Lovely ladies in these lazy days.  
And though I never took a wife,  
May I say that I have loved me one or two.  
Of the people in my past, fading faces  
In a waking dream,  
And though they never seemed to last very long,  
There are faces I remember from  
The places in my past.  
  
I said all the dead head miles  
And the insincere smiles.  
Sometimes I can laugh and cry  
And I can't remember why.  
But I still love those good times gone by,  
Hold on to them close or let them go, oh no.  
I don't know, I just seem to sing these songs  
And say I'm sorry for the friends I used to know.
