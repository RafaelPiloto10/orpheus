You keep comin' to me tryin' to look inside my mind well what you see  
Are you wonderin' if you're in there well you are but baby you got company  
I'm not looking for a place to go when I'll leave I won't be coming back no
more  
I'm more like a circus show I pitch my tent and then I'll go  
So git in line at least one time  
  
I'm not just a side show either step up front but don't just stand and stare  
Yeah I'm the main attraction but understand I'll sell my tickets anywhere  
I'm not looking for a place to go  
  
You keep comin' to me tryin'
