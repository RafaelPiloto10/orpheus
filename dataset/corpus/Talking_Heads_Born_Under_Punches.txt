Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands  
The hand speaks, the hand of a government man  
Well I'm a tumbler born under punches, I'm so thin  
  
All I want is to breathe  
(I'm too thin)  
Won't you breathe with me?  
Find a little space, so we move in-between  
(In-between it)  
And keep one step ahead, of yourself  
  
Don't you miss it, don't you miss it  
Some of you people just about missed it  
Last time to make plans  
And I'm a tumbler, I'm a government man  
  
Never seen anything like that before  
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor  
(Well I'm a tumbler)  
When you get to where you wanna be  
(Thank you! Thank you!)  
When you get to where you wanna be  
(Well, don't even mention it)  
  
Oh, take a look at these hands, they're passing in-between us  
Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands, you don't have to mention it  
No thanks, I'm a government man  
  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
And the heat goes on  
(I got time)  
And the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on, where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
I'm not a drowning man  
And I'm not a burning building! I'm a tumbler  
Drowning cannot hurt a man  
Fire cannot hurt a man, not the government man  
  
All I want is to breathe  
(Thank you, thank you)  
Won't you breathe with me?  
Find a little space so we move in-between  
(I'm so thin)  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
(I'm catching up with myself)  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Won't you breathe with me?  
(Hands of a government man)  
Find a little space so we move in-between  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
(Don't you miss it! Don't you miss it!)  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Won't you breathe with me?
