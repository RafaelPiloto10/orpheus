Wonderful day, for passing my way  
Knock on my door and even the score with your eyes....  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend  
  
Dark cloud of fear is blowing away  
Now that you're here, you're going to stay, 'cause it's  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend  
  
Tell us what you've seen  
In far away forgotten lands  
Where empires have turned back to sand  
  
Wonderful day for passing my way  
Knock on my door, and even the score with your eyes..  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend...
