Now, are why'all ready?  
Are why'all ready?  
Here we go now  
Do it with the fever  
Yeah, come on  
  
Ain't no stoppin' us now  
We're on the move  
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah)  
Ain't no stoppin' us now  
We've got the groove  
(Spice Girls, check it out)  
  
There've been so many things that have held us down  
But now it looks like things are finally comin' around, yeah  
I know we've got a long, long way to go, yeah  
And were we'll end up, I don't know  
  
But we won't let nothin' hold us back  
We're gonna get ourselves together, ha  
We're gon' polish up our act, yeah  
And if you've ever been held down before  
I know that you refuse to be held down any more, yeah-yeah  
  
Don't you let nothin', nothin'  
(Nothin' stand in your way, and all ago)  
I want why'all to listen, listen  
(That's right, to every word I say, every word I say about it)  
  
Ain't no stoppin' us now (that's right)  
We're on the move (you said it, we've got the groove)  
Ain't no stoppin' us now  
We've got the groove (ooh-oh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh)  
Ain't no stoppin' us now  
We're on the move (we've got the groove)  
Ain't no stoppin' us now  
We've got the groove (yeah, look let me tell you this)  
  
I know you know someone who's got a negative vibe (who?)  
And if you only happen they only keep you alive (shut up!)  
They really don't have nowhere to go  
Ask them were they're going, they don't know  
  
But we won't let nothin' hold us back  
We're gonna get ourselves together, come on  
We're gon' polish up our act, yeah  
And if you've ever been held down before  
I know that yo
