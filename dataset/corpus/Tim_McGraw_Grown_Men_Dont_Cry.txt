I pulled into the shopping center  
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother  
Like ice cream melting, they embraced  
Years of bad decisions running down her face  
All morning I'd been thinking my life's so hard  
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car  
I wanted to tell them it would be ok  
But I just got in my Suburban, and I, I drove away  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
  
Keep having this dream about my old man  
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand  
We're talking on the front porch watching the sun go down  
But it was just a dream, he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around  
So many things I want to say to him  
I just placed a rose on his grave and I talked to the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife and everything that I hold dear in
my life  
We say Grace and thank the Lord, got so much to be thankful for  
Then its up the stairs and off to bed  
And my little girl says "I haven't had my story yet"  
Everything weighing on my mind disappears, just like that  
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, "I love you dad"  
  
[Chorus]
