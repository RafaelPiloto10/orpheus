I never wanted to go  
I never wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
Caught in a trap of routine  
Caught in a shitty old scene  
I'll tell you a secret  
I need it  
Take a trip and you'll see what I mean  
  
Time is just not, only seconds in a day  
'Cause what you got, can be taken all away  
With just one shot, yeah nothings here to stay  
Why don't you get up? 'Cause this ime it's going down  
  
Wanting and waiting  
Dreams are fading  
Things will never be the same  
Ever changing and rearranging  
Will you notice anyway?  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
One day you'll look, and see that things are not the same  
The time you took, has been taken all away  
The hands you shook, don't even know your name  
You better get up cause this time it's going down  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
Take a look and see that things are not the same
