Sometimes I wonder I'd ever make it through?  
Through this world without having you.  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
'Cause sometimes it seems like this world 's closing in on me.  
And there's no way of breaking free and then I see You reach for me  
Sometimes I wanna give up, wanna give in I wanna quit the fight  
And then I see You Baby and everything's all right,  
Everything's all right  
  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world, ohow  
You know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light ohow  
See it shining right through the rain  
When I see you smile  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
  
Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do  
What a touch of your hand can do  
It's like nothing that I ever knew  
And when the rain is falling I don't feel it  
'Cause you're here with me now.  
I wanna add you baby is all I'll ever need  
It's all I'll ever need.  
  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world, ohow  
You know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light ohow  
I see it shining right through the rain  
When I see you smile baby  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
Sometimes I wanna give up, I wanna give in I wanna quit the fight  
Then one look at you baby and everything's all right,  
Everything's all right  
  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world, ohow  
You know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light ohow  
I see it shining right through the rain  
When I see you smile  
Yeah I can face the world, ohow  
You know I can do Anything now  
When I see you smile ow yeah  
Baby when I see you... Smile  
Smile at me...
