You breathe in me and I'm alive  
With the power of Your holiness  
You breathe in me and You revive  
Feelings in my soul that I've laid to rest  
  
So breathe in me, I need You, now  
I've never felt so dead within  
So breathe in me, maybe somehow  
You can breathe new life in me again  
  
I used to be so sensitive  
To the light that leads to where You are  
Now I've acquired these callouses  
With the darkness of a cold and jaded heart  
  
So breathe in me, I need You, now  
I've never felt so dead within  
So breathe in me, maybe somehow  
You can breathe new life in me again  
  
So breathe in me, I need You, now  
I've never felt so dead within  
So breathe in me, maybe somehow  
You can breathe new life in me again
