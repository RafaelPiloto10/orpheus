How tides control the sea, and what becomes of me  
How little things can slip out of your hands  
How often people change, no two remain the same  
Why things don't always turn out as you plan  
  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand  
  
I can't, and I can't decide  
Wrong, all my wrong from right  
Day, all my day for night  
Dark, all my dark for light  
I live, but I love this life  
  
How infinite is space, and who decides your fate  
Why everything will dissolve into sand  
How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet  
Why nothing even turns out how you planned  
  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand  
  
I can't, and I can't decide  
Wrong, all my wrong from right  
Day, all my day for night  
Or dark, all my dark for light  
I live, but I love this life
