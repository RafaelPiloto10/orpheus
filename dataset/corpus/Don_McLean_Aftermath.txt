Windows in a silent room, sunlight burns the walls to black  
Angles and dimensions melt while colors drip and pillows crack  
Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet  
The ribbon film of separate frames lying curled up at my feet  
  
The film is just a snake design and the photographs are fading fast  
These are not memories of mine I have no future, no past  
  
I've seen a thousand afternoons dissolve into the night  
Like sugar crystals on a spoon they disappear from sight  
  
Gray days from the crispest morning to the warmest afternoon in this room  
  
And I like to draw the face I saw so long ago  
My image in the mirror tells the jagged lines which way to go  
  
The black and white description of the sole survivor of the Holocaust  
All the rest were lost  
  
Do you see this paper face? It has no color or no mood  
My eyes are ageless, as am I. I need no sleep, I need no food  
I am a king, but like a child the other children laugh at me  
Tongues of fire, wagging wild they dance around me merrily  
  
I'll kill them all and if I fail I'll kill whoever I can find  
Then they'll beg me to be kind  
  
My eyes have seen far more than eyes can ever tell  
This planet plunged through mushroom fires of earthly hell  
  
I know that my sweet Jesus said that he'd return  
But Babylon has fallen and the cities burn
