It's a mother's intuition to make a little space  
It's her quiet mission to tidy up her place  
A mother's intuition is like a kangaroo's  
She hops around, she mops the ground, she fusses over you  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
It's a mother's intuition to wash her baby  
Well, she won't forget behind the ears  
And the extra soap suds on the tail  
A mother's into cleaning, she'll clean until she's through  
She's smart enough, she's wise enough to add up two and two  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
A mother has a feeling, she pays special attention  
If someone is concealing, if someone's playing tricks  
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets  
Until the answer clicks  
Then she takes a brush and polishes your teeth  
She'll make you shine and sparkle new  
Until she finds the real you underneath  
Isn't it charming?  
Just mommy and little roo  
Fresh as a daisy  
Sparkling just like new  
It's a mother's intuition  
It's a mother's intuition  
It's a mother's intuition
