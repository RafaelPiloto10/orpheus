There's a house somewhere I know where's the fire's burning all night long  
There's a swing outside on the porch where I feel like I'll  
Rock away the dusk until the dawn  
And even though the wind may be howlin'  
The stars are bright and they push me on and on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
Now the shoes on my feet, those soles broken down  
And my coat is tattered and worn  
And the hunger in my belly, and the fever in my head  
Will vanish 'ere my first glimpse of home  
And even though the rain may now be fallin'  
The passion is deep and pushes me on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
There's a still at dawn like the sound of your loves breath  
As she lies sleeping  
Down below me now in the valley  
Is the only piece on earth that I ever want to know  
And her lips are as soft as I remember  
She alone has brought me back on home  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight
