Mother told me, yes, she told me I'd meet girls like you  
She also told me, "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch."  
Just the other day I heard  
A soldier falling off some Indonesian junk that's going round  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay  
  
Father says, "Your mother's right, she's really up on things."  
"Before we married, Mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines."  
Now, I had heard the wacs recruited old maids for the war  
But mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay  
  
Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?  
Ev'ry time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?  
When I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch  
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, got my Kiss records out  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay  
  
Away  
Away  
  
[Chorus 7x]
