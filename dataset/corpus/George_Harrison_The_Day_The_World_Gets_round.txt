The day the world gets 'round  
to understanding where it is,  
Using all it's found,  
to help each other, hand in hand  
  
The day the world gets 'round  
to understanding where it's gone  
Losing so much ground  
killing each other, hand in hand  
Such foolishness in man  
I want no part of their plan - OH NO  
  
If you're the destructive kind  
Now I'm working from day to day  
As I don't want to be like you  
I look for the pure of heart  
And the ones that have made a start,  
  
But Lord, there are just a few  
who bow before you,  
in silence they pray,  
  
Oh how they pray for the day the  
world gets 'round  
  
Using all they've found  
To help each other, hand in hand  
  
The Day The World Gets 'Round
