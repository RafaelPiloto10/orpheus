I do not sleep tonight  
I might not ever  
The sins of the past have come  
See how they sit down together  
  
Outside my window  
Outside my door  
And I know the reason  
What they've all come here for  
  
You my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all, because of  
  
Surrender is easy  
I know you do me no harm  
But your innocence haunts me  
The most fatal of charms  
  
Oh I must have done some wrong  
On a dark and distant day  
For I know full and well tonight  
This is how that I must pay  
  
And you my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all, because of  
You my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all because of
