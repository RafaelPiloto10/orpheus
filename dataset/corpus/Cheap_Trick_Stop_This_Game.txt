Well I can't stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I don't want to hear it  
Don't want to hear it no more  
No more  
  
I can't stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I don't want to hear it  
Don't want to hear it no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
Hey, livin' with you  
Is all I wanted before  
I've changed, you didn't  
Don't want to see you no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Oh, stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
Well we were walkin' before we could crawl  
And you were lovin' just emotion just all  
It's just emotion wasn't music at all  
Now I can't stop the music  
Now I don't want to hear it no more  
No more, no more, no more  
  
Stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
I can't stop the music (stop this game)  
I could stop it before (it's gonna really end)  
Now I don't want to hear it (stop this game)  
Don't want to hear it no more (it's such a touchy, touchy thing)
