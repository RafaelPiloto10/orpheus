If you feel the rolling thunder  
An' your eyes see lightning strike,  
Don't be afraid, just call on me  
I'll bring you shelter from the night  
  
When the wind is howling  
I'll hold you near,  
An' soothe your troubled mind  
With a little bit of this,  
An' a little bit of that  
I'll make you leave all your worries behind  
  
Don't try to hold on to what you got,  
'Cause I got what you need  
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,  
Come on, give it to me  
  
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood  
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood  
Youngblood...  
  
When you're burning hot with fever  
An' you shake down to your bones,  
Don't get yourself into a cold sweat  
'Cause it's just your bad blood throwing stones  
The devil has got your number  
An' he wants you hanging on a line,  
But, before the night is over, baby  
I'm gonna make you mine  
  
Don't try to hold on to what you got,  
'Cause I got what you need  
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,  
Come on, give it to me  
  
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood  
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood  
I'm coming to get you  
  
Don't try to hold on to what you got,  
'Cause I got what you need  
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,  
Come on, give it to me  
  
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood  
  
I'm gonna make you mine
