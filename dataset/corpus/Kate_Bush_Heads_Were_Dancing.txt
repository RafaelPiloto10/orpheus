You talked me into the game of chance  
It was '39 before the music started  
When you walked up to me and you said  
"Hey, heads we dance."  
Well I didn't know who were  
Until I saw the morning paper.  
  
There was a picture of you  
A picture of you 'cross the front page  
It looked just like you, just like you in every way.  
But it couldn't be true.  
It couldn't be true  
You stepped out of a stranger.  
  
They say that the Devil is a charming man  
And just like you I bet he can dance  
And he is coming up behind in his long  
Tailed black coat dance  
All tails in the air  
But the penny landed with its head dancing  
  
A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform  
Standing with your head held high  
Hot down to the floor  
But it couldn't be you  
It couldn't be you,  
It's a picture of Hitler.  
  
He go do-do-do-do-do  
He go do-do-do-do-do  
He go do-do-do-do-do  
Do you want to dance?  
Well, I couldn't see what was to be  
So I just stood there laughing.  
  
A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform  
Standing with your head held high  
Hot down to the floor  
But it couldn't be you  
It couldn't be you,  
It's a picture of Hitler.  
  
He go  
He go  
He go  
Heads we're dancing
