Verse 1:  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That we are the ones who can make the change  
In the world today...  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That all of your dreams in your heart  
Can come true... Today... Yeah...  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That life could be all that you want it to be... Today... Yeah...  
Chorus:  
If I had wings I would fly  
'Cause all that I need, You are  
And if the world caved in around me  
To You I'd still hold on  
Cause You're all that I believe  
And the one that created me  
Jesus... Because of You... I'm free  
Verse 2:  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That God can make miracles happen today  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That you don't need to wait for the answers before...  
You step out in faith...  
Would you believe me if I said  
That nothing is ever impossible... For God... Yeah... [Chorus:]  
Bridge:  
Just live your life... With God inside  
You wont regret one moment of it  
And give all that you can for God... For God[Chorus x2]
