Heal me, my darling  
Heal me, my darling  
Baby, I'm hot just like an oven  
I need some lovin', yeah  
And baby, I can't hold it much longer  
It's getting stronger and stronger  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing, baby  
Makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve my mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Is good for me  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me  
Whenever blue tear drops are falling  
And my emotional stability is leaving me  
There is something I can do  
Oh, I can get on the telephone, call you up, baby  
And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me  
The love you give to me will free me  
If you don't know the thing you're dealing  
Ooh, I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing  
Heal me, my darling  
Heal me, my darling  
Baby, I got sick this morning  
A sea was storming inside of me  
Baby, I think I'm capsizing  
The waves are rising and rising  
When I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me  
And it's good for me  
And it's so good to me, my baby, ohh  
Just take control, just grab a hold  
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it  
Honey, we're feeling fine  
You're my medicine  
Open up and let me in  
Darling, you're so great  
I can't wait for you to operate  
Get up  
Wake up  
If you don't know  
The truth you're dealing  
Oh, I can tell you, darling  
That it's sexual healing  
Sexual, oh yeah  
Makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve my mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Oh, baby  
Oh, when I get that feeling, baby  
Oh, when I get that feeling  
It's sexual healing, baby  
Oh, when I get that feeling  
Heal me, my darling  
Heal me, my darling  
Heal me, my darling  
Oh, baby
