Old days  
Good times I remember  
Fun days  
Filled with simple of pleasure  
Drive-in movies  
Comic books and blue jeans  
Howdy Doody  
Baseball cards and birthdays  
Please take me back  
To the world gone away  
Memories  
Seem like yesterday  
  
Old days  
Good times I remember  
Gold days  
Days I'll always treasure  
Funny faces  
Full of love and laughter  
Funny places  
Summer nights and streetcars  
Take me back  
To the world gone away  
Our good memories  
Seem like yesterday  
  
Old days.
