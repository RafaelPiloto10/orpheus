  
  
Get at 'em boys, go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right, never wrong  
How mountain girls can love  
  
Ridin' at night in a high cold wind  
On the trail of the old lonesome pine  
Thinking of you baby  
Feelin' so blue  
Wondering why I left you behind  
  
Get at 'em boys, go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right, never wrong  
How mountain girls can love  
  
There's a lake in the hill  
Where my true love goes  
That's when she's thinkin' of me  
Why I'm not there only heaven knows  
Heaven knows that's where I'd rather be  
  
Get at 'em boys, go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right, never wrong  
How mountain girls can love
