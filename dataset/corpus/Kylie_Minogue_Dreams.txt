To have every man but to love only one  
To wake with the moon and sleep with the sun  
To be a sinner, a saint, a lover, a friend  
To know a beginning but never and end  
To fly in the ocean and swim in the skies  
Believer in truth, defendant of lies  
To know the purest love, the deepest pain  
To be lost and found again, and again, and again  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
To know the power of wealth and poverty  
To taste every moment and try everything  
To be hailed a hero, branded a fool  
Believe in the sacred and break every rule  
To give into pleasure with no boundaries  
Living in chaos and harmony  
To feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress  
To know the limit of torture and tenderness  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling keep believing in dreams
