Over mountains and sky blue seas  
On great circles will you watch for me?  
The sweetest feeling I've got inside  
I just can't wait to get lost in your eyes  
And all these words that you meant to say  
Held in silence day after day  
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  
Please don't keep them  
Hidden away  
  
Sing it out so I can finally breathe  
And I can take in all you say  
Holding out for something I believe in  
All I really need today  
I want to free your heart  
I want to see your heart  
Please don't keep your heart  
Hidden away  
  
You're a wonder, how bright you shine  
A flickered candle in a short lifetime  
A secret dreamer that never shows  
If no one sees you then nobody knows  
And all these words you were meant to say  
  
Held in silence day after day  
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  
Please don't keep them  
Hidden away  
  
Sing it out so I can finally breathe  
And I can take in all you say  
Reaching out for someone I believe in  
All I really need today  
I want to feel your love  
Will you reveal your love  
Please don't keep your love  
Hidden away  
  
I want to free your heart  
I want to see your heart  
Please don't keep your heart  
Hidden away  
  
You  
You  
You
