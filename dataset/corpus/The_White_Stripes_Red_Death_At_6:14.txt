[alright there, can I get a copy on a 6-14? 6-14?]  
la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la  
whoo!  
what's that she said -  
What's that she said -  
What's that she said, with her fingers turning blue  
And her face was turning red?!  
Whoo!  
Was that her dad -  
Was that her dad -  
Was that her dad -  
With the magic marker, writing little angel on her head?!  
la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la  
whoo!  
She must be dead  
Well she must be dead  
She must be dead  
If the only sound I hear  
Are the devils by her bed  
("aw" ... "oh well")  
[coughing]  
Whoo!  
What's that she said  
What's that she said  
What's that she said  
With her fingers turning blue  
And her face was turning red
