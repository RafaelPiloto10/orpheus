I'm wishing you a well...mind at peace within yourself...  
Covers up I cast you off...I'll be watching as you breathe....  
I'd lie still you move I'd send you off around the bend...  
I hold your head deep in my arms...my fingertips they close your  
Eyes...  
Off you dream my little child...there's a sun around the bend...  
There's a sun around the bend...  
All the evenings close like this...all these moments that I've  
Missed...  
Please forgive, won't you, dear?  
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend...  
You're an angel when you sleep...  
How I want your soul to keep of and all around the bend...
