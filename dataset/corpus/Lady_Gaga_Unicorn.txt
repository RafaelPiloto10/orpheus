I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn (2x)  
  
He's begging me to come with him  
I don't know why  
When I'm with this I feel free  
Like a monster that could fly  
  
Through the skies I come in  
Through the skies I feel free (baby)  
Like an unicorn can blow my horn (2x)  
  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my head?  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my brain?  
I'm not sure to give my to another body  
Well, he's innocent I can't blame  
  
Unicorn Unicorn  
Innocent  
In the dark  
Unicorn  
Unicorn  
Be afraid of the souls  
Be far  
  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my head?  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my brain?  
I'm not sure to give my to another body  
Well, he's innocent I can't blame  
  
I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn (2x)
