I'd like to know, baby  
How you feel about me  
I'd like to know, baby  
How you feel about me  
I've got to know if you think you might leave me  
Baby won't you break it to me  
If you're planning to deceive me  
Woah-oh to deceive me  
I'd like to hear  
What you say when you talk about me  
Do your friends know something I don't  
Or just appears to be  
Everyone says on the surface things look fine  
Am I still the only one for you  
And is it true are you really mine  
Woah-oh really mine  
If you go away I won't know what to do or what to say  
Baby I can't make it without you beside me every day  
Baby tell me baby show that this is not a fake  
Just try and show me that there's no mistake  
In staying with you  
Woah-oh, with you  
  
I'd like to know, baby  
How you feel about me  
I'd like to know, baby  
How you feel about me  
I've got to know if you think you might leave me  
Baby won't you break it to me  
If you're planning to deceive me  
Woah-oh to deceive me  
  
I'd like to know I'd like to know I'd like to know....
