What, what, what you want? Hey  
My thing is a real fine thing  
It's a thing, it's a real fine thing  
It ain't broke, it don't need a fix  
Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six  
I got a gyroscope goin' round and round  
Got a Thunderbird take me all over town  
Got a transistor radio standin' on the mix  
Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six  
Thirty six, eighteen, thirty six  
Where'd she go?  
What you say?  
What you say?  
What you say?  
(Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six)  
What you say?  
(Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six)  
You want what?  
(Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six)  
What you say?  
(Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six)  
What you want?
