There ain't nothing in the bottom of your glass  
For a broken heart  
You were doing pretty good till she came  
And tore your world apart  
She found a little younger model  
You ran straight for the bottle  
There ain't nothing in the bottom of your glass  
For a broken heart  
  
Do you find yourself tossin' and a turnin'  
In the middle of the night  
With a cigarette burning  
Staying up until the broad daylight  
Well you gotta be going crazy  
With another man lovin' on your baby  
There ain't nothing in the middle of the night  
For a broken heart  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't never been a cure for the lowdown blues  
When a woman puts on a pair of walking shoes  
You ought to know by now  
There's nothing, son, that you can do  
For a broken heart  
  
Ain't nothing when the morning finally comes  
Gonna change a thing  
A little hair of the dog ain't gonna hurt you  
Have yourself a drink  
She found another lover  
I sure feel for you brother  
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world for a broken heart  
  
[Chorus]
