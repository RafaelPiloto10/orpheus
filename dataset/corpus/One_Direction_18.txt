[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
I got a heart, and I got a soul  
Believe me, I use them both  
We made a start, be it a false one I know  
Baby, I don't want to feel alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Verse 2: Niall Horan]  
We took a chonce, God knows we've tried  
Yet all along I knew we'd be fine  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
So pour me a drink, oh love  
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything we can  
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
  
[Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson]  
To be loved and to be in love  
  
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
And I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen
