She can get any by the low  
Permission not approved  
It's okay, it's under control  
Show me soprano, cause girl you can handle  
Baby we start snagging, you come in part clothes  
Girl I'm losing wing, my Bugatti the same road  
Show me your perfect pitch,  
You got it my banjo  
Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles  
So amusing, now you can make a whistle with the music  
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it  
Give me the perfect picture, never lose it
