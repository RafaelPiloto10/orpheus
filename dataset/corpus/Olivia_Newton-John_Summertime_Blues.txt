Well I'm gonna raise a fuss and I'm gonna raise a hollar  
I've been working all summer just to try to earn a dollar  
Well the time will come baby whn I try to get a date  
My boss says no dice girl ya gotta work late  
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Well my momma and brother told me girl ya gotta make some money  
If you want to use the car to go a-riding next Sunday  
Well I din't go to work, I told the boss I was sick  
You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work late  
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
I'm gonna take two weeks gonna have a fine vacation  
Gonna take my problem to the United Nations  
Well I called the Congressman and he said quote:  
I'd like to help ya honey but you're too young to vote  
Huh, sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Ain't no cure, no no  
Ain't no cure, no no
