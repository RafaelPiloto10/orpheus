Hey bro, take it slow  
You ain't livin' in a video  
You're flying low with a high velocity  
No doubt, you're stressin' out  
That ain't what rock n' roll's about  
Get off that one way trip down lonely street  
  
Now I know you've been kicked around  
You ain't alone in this ugly town  
You stick a needle in your arm  
You bite the dust, you buy the farm  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
  
C'mon girl, it's a better day  
Get your foot out of that grave  
Don't let that one love tear your world apart  
C'mon babe, kick that stuff  
Show the street it ain't so tough  
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart  
  
Now I know you've been seeing red  
Don't put a pistol to your head  
Sometimes your answer's heaven sent  
Your way is so damn permanent  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
  
This ain't your daddy talkin'  
You know, I know  
Your story ain't so shocking  
You know, I know  
Blow some steam  
C'mon and scream  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid
