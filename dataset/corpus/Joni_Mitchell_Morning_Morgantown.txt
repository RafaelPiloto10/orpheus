When morning comes to Morgantown  
The merchants roll their awnings down  
The milktrucks make their morning rounds  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
We'll rise up early, with the sun  
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning  
And the day is young  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
Morning Morgantown  
Buy your dreams a dollar down  
Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same  
  
We'll find a table in the shade  
And sip our tea and lemonade  
And watch the morning on parade  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
Ladies in their rainbow fashions  
Colored stop and go lights flashing  
We'll wink at total strangers passing in  
Morning, Morgantown  
  
Morning Morgantown  
Buy your dreams a dollar down  
Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same  
  
I'd like to buy you everything  
A wooden bird with painted wings  
A window full of colored rings  
In morning, Morgantown.  
  
But the only thing I have to give  
To make you smile, to win you with  
Are all the mornings still to live  
In morning, Morgantown
