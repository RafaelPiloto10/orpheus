We were working secretly for the military  
Our experiment in sound was nearly ready to begin  
We only know in theory what we are doing  
Music made for pleasure, music made to thrill  
It was music we were making here until  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
From the painful cries of mothers to a terrifying scream  
We recorded it and put it into our machine  
  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
It could feel like falling in love  
It could feel so bad  
It could feel so good  
It could sing you to sleep  
But that dream is your enemy!!  
  
We won't be there to be blamed  
We won't be there to snitch  
I just pray that someone there can hit the switch  
  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
And the public are warned to stay off
