Now you're talking in headlines  
Up to the minute and free  
Stop press, hold the front page  
Up as a mirror  
Are you reading me?  
Watch you walking in waltz time  
A jigsaw puzzle in tune  
Or are you faking a straight line  
To suit yourself too soon  
Rather nouveau than never  
Contemporary ideal  
  
Some natural kind of poet might slow it  
But she sells more my speed  
She sells country and modern  
Ancient western song  
Of oriental confusion  
You so right, me so wrong  
Now you're fixing to fly me  
Auto-erotic, please,  
On the break that you're gliding.  
  
Your lingerie's a gift-wrap  
Slip it to me  
Nine till five  
The daily grind  
Made-up lies  
Make up my mind  
Same machine consuming you  
Consuming you  
Oh why  
She sells  
I need  
Oh why love why  
She sells  
I need.
