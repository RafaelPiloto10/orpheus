Here's a story about Minnie the Moocher  
She was a low down hoochie-coocher  
She was the roughest, toughest frail  
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale  
  
[Original Chorus]  
Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho (hodee-hodee-hodee-ho)  
Ra-dee-da-dee-da (ra-dee-da-dee-da)  
Teedle-teedle-dee (teedle-teedle-dee)  
Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho (hodee-hodee-hodee-ho)  
  
Min' had a dream about the King of Sweden  
He gave her things that she was needin'  
Gave her a home built of gold and steel  
A platinum car with diamond starlet wheels  
  
[Variations on Chorus]  
  
Oh Minnie met ol' Deacon Lowdown  
He preached to her, oh you oughta slow down  
But Minnie wiggled and did the stroll  
The Deacon Lowdown hollered, oh save my soul  
  
[Variations on Chorus]  
  
They took her where they put the crazies  
Now poor ol' Minnie is a-kickin' up daisies  
You heard my story, this ends my song  
She was just a good gal, but they done her wrong  
  
[Variations on Chorus]
