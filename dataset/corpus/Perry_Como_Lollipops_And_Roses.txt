Tell her you care, each time you speak  
Make it her birthday each day of the week  
Bring her nice things, sugar and spice things  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses...  
  
One day she'll smile, next day she'll cry  
Minute to minute, you'll never know why!  
Coax her, pet her, better yet get her  
Roses and lollipops,  
And lollipops and roses...  
  
We try acting grown up, but as a rule  
We're all little children, fresh from school...  
  
So, carry her books, that's how it starts  
Fourteen to forty, they're kids in their hearts...  
Keep them handy, flowers and candy  
Roses and lollipops,  
And lollipops and roses . . .
