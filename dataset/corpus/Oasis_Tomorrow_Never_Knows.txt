Turn off your mind, relax  
And float down stream  
It is not dying  
It is not dying  
  
Lay down all thought  
Surrender to the void  
It is shining  
It is shining  
  
That you may see  
The meaning of within  
It is being  
It is being  
  
That love is all  
And love is everyone  
It is knowing  
It is knowing  
  
That ignorance and hate  
May mourn the dead  
It is believing  
It is believing  
  
But listen to the  
Color of your dreams  
It is not living  
It is not living  
  
Or play the game  
Existence to the end  
Of the beginning  
Of the beginning  
Of the beginning  
Of the beginning  
Of the beginning  
Of the beginning
