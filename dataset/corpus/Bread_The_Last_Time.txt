Hey, didn't you believe me when I told you I was leaving?  
Well, wait a little while and soon you will be believing  
I'm telling you now like I told you before  
That love has got to be something more  
Than a pastime, this is the last time  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the last time that I will say goodbye  
You say it doesn't mean a thing  
Let's see what the future brings  
In the past, I've changed my mind, but  
This has got to be the last time  
  
Well, didn't you believe it when I said you don't know how to love me?  
You, you never understood that you weren't so high above me  
I didn't realize 'til a moment ago  
That time doesn't really go this slow  
And it's past time, this is the last time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you gonna do when nights are getting colder, baby?  
Where ya gonna go, you know you're getting older, baby?  
Guess you're gonna have to be a little bolder, baby  
What you gonna do to satisfy your hunger, baby?  
Oh, don't it seem that everyone's a-getting younger, baby?  
Guess you're gonna have to find yourself another pastime  
Judging from the past, I know it won't be the last time  
  
[Chorus]
