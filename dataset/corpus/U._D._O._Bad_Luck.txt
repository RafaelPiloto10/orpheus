I have to tell a story - about a man  
Never in the mood - to change his life  
Nobody wants to help him - as he spirals down  
But one day the wrong decision - hit him overnight  
  
No more cocktail parties - champagne's run dry  
No company take-overs - stock markets high  
No more hand-jobs in the boardroom - sex is history  
And no saunas, no jacuzzis - the penalties you'll reap  
  
At last he realized - he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere - double-dealing lies  
  
He's going down on his bad luck - his just deserts  
He's going down on his bad luck - what he deserved  
  
His old man told him always - listen son  
It's a two-way street to fortune - you gotta hit and run  
Don't forget the mirror - look who's behind  
And don't you come up crying - when it's faster coming down  
  
At last he realized - he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere - double-dealing lies  
  
He's going down on his bad luck - his just deserts  
He's going down on his bad luck - what he deserved  
He's going down on his bad luck - it's his time  
He's going down on his bad luck - can't rewind  
  
Do you get the story - you know this man  
Have you learned a lesson - do you understand  
When all you got is crystal - you shouldn't cast a stone  
So be careful when you go up - 'cause you'll meet them coming down  
  
He's going down on his bad luck - his just deserts  
He's going down on his bad luck - what he deserved  
He's going down on his bad luck - it's his time  
He's going down on his bad luck - can't rewind
