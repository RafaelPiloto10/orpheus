Identity is the crisis can't you see  
Identity identity  
  
When you look in the mirror  
Do you see yourself  
Do you see yourself  
On the t.v. screen  
Do you see yourself in the magazine  
When you see yourself  
Does it make you scream  
  
When you look in the mirror  
Do you smash it quick  
Do you take the glass  
And slash your wrists  
Did you do it for fame  
Did you do it in a fit  
Did you do it before  
You read about it
