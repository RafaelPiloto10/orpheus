Five, six, five, six, seven let's go!  
Let's go, go, go!  
Let's go, let's go, let's really go!  
  
One more round, girls.  
Let the Boy Scouts hear you.  
One for your mother and  
Two for your teachers and  
Three for the pretty boys in a row.  
One for the money and  
Two to get ready and  
Three now your ready and  
Four to go.  
Let's go!  
Let's go, go!  
Let's go, let's go, let's really go!  
  
Girl to girl, there's nothing like  
How they understand.  
Heal the wounds when the boys bite.  
They're just holding your hand.  
Can't explain to a man how  
Those girls know. Girls show  
Strength that living can bring.  
So strong, so long,  
Songs the girls sing.  
  
(Four part round)  
One more round, girls.

Three for the pretty boys in a row.  
One for the money and  
Two to get ready and  
Three now you're ready and  
Four to go.  
Let's go!
