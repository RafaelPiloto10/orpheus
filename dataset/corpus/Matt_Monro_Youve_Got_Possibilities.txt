Baby you're improvabe  
It won't Take long  
Mountains can be movable  
If the spirit's strong  
You've got possibilities  
Takes a fella to tell  
You've got possibilities  
Let me pry you from your shell  
  
Somewhere way down deep in you There's life No doubt  
It's just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
You've got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You don't even know you've got  
You won't be shy When I get through  
I'll make you purr You pussycat you  
Somewhere way down deep in you There's life No doubt  
It's just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
You've got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You don't even know you've got
