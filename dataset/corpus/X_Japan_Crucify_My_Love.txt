Crucify my love  
  
[Chorus]  
If my love is blind  
Crucify my love  
If it sets me free  
Never know, never trust  
That love should see a color  
Crucify my love  
If it should be that way  
  
[Bridge]  
Swing the heartache  
Feel it inside out  
When the wind cries  
I'll say goodbye  
Tried to learn, tried to find  
To reach out for eternity  
Where's the answer  
Is this forever  
  
Like a river flowing to the sea  
You'll be miles away and I will know  
I know I can deal with the pain  
No reason to cry  
  
Crucify my love  
[Chorus]  
  
Till the loneliness shadows the sky  
I'll be sailing down and I will know  
I know I can clear clouds away  
Oh! is it a crime to love  
  
[Bridge]  
[Chorus]
