Give me iko  
I want to ball the wall here  
Shuffle in Dumaine  
Hear the hookacumbi  
  
Meet my tipatina  
Love her hold her tightly  
Want to see her swaying  
In New Orleans nightly  
  
You know I want to be there  
Drinking in the morning  
Holler in the evening  
Dr. Jazz Dr. Jazz  
  
Bake my jelly roll  
You quicken my pulse  
You make my rhythm slow  
Crawfish gumbo  
  
Rhythm from the jungle  
Big chief rocking  
I follow the voodoo king  
Oolamalawaladollar  
  
That's what the fez he sing  
  
How long must it be  
How long must I wait  
Till Highway 49 takes me to your gate  
I eat a bowl of gumbo  
  
That Creole child will serve  
Sit on the verandah  
Happy in a Dixie world  
  
Maybe on Sunday  
Head for Baton Rouge  
Dancing with the Cajun  
Twist away my blues  
  
Then a drop of rain  
A trickle in my eye  
I look up and smile  
At the rhythm that never, never dies
