You're never going to see what you like  
You're never going to wake up and change your mind  
You're never going to keep what you hold  
You won't accomplish anything on your own  
  
You can't have what you wanted  
So make up your mind and come to your senses  
  
You'll never win if you don't bend  
It's not so complicated  
If you decide to change your mind  
You'll find your inundated  
  
You're never going to do what you say  
You'll always try to make up another way  
You're never going to act on your own  
You're never going to see that you're all alone  
  
And so you're here and you don't know  
If you can choose the way to go  
It's not about the way it is  
So don't become a realist  
You've got time to make a choice  
Don't think aloud but have a voice  
And when you think the time is right  
Don't ever be afraid to fight
