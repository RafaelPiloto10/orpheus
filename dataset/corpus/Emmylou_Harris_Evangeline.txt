She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi  
Alone in the pale moonlight  
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler  
Said that he'd return tonight  
  
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi  
Lovin' the whole night through  
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'  
And bring it on back to you  
  
Evangeline, Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away  
  
Bayou Sam from south Louisiana'  
Had gamblin' in his veins  
Evangeline from the maritime  
Was slowly goin' insane  
  
High on the top of a hickory hill  
She stands in the lightning and thunder  
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'  
She watched that queen go under  
  
Evangeline Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away  
  
Evangeline Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away
