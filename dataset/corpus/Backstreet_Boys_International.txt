Away  
Internationally  
Away  
  
Chorus:  
Away  
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go  
Girl I want you in a plane in a seat right next to mine  
Get witchu right after my shows  
Baby I could give you ways  
Come on girl, lets fly  
Away  
Internationally  
  
Now I don't usually meet under these circumstances, but...  
You're like the perfect girl with the perfect skin, so...  
I'm just too scared to know that I'm gonna leave without you girl [?]  
  
You can call me a man  
  
Bridge 1:  
Because I know  
That this aint the kind of love that could just take  
One night and then it's over  
Girl I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl I can think of only one and no one else and dance to you  
Were like the perfect team  
No matter where I go you gotta roll  
I bet they know about you and I'm not leaving without you girl [?]  
  
And I don't need to read your mind  
  
Bridge 2:  
Because I know  
That you want to see the world  
And I could say that all I need is  
One night and then well be closer  
And I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag
