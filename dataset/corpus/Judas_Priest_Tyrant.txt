Behold 'tis I the commander  
Whose grip controls you all  
Resist me not, surrender  
I'll no compassion call  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Your very lives are held within my fingers  
I snap them and you cower down in fear  
You spineless things who belly down to slither  
To the end of the world you follow to be near  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
I listen not to sympathy  
Whilst ruler of this land  
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans  
Or suffer smite from this my hand  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
My legions faithful unto death  
I'll summon to my court  
And as you perish each of you  
Shall scream as you are sought  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall
