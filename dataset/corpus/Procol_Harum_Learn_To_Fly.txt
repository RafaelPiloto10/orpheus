You and me got a chance to make things right  
The writing... The writing's on the wall  
You and me got a chance to turn things 'round  
We got no time... The future's slipping  
Through our hands  
  
Learn to fly  
Where eagles only dare to try  
We're on the wing  
We dare to win  
We see the future and we're gonna make it  
Learn to live  
You know you got so much to give  
It's in the air  
It's everywhere  
We got a vision and we're gonna claim it  
  
You and me we can't turn back at all  
The die is cast... (You know) the deal is done  
You and me we knew this day would come  
And now it's here... the journey's just begun  
  
Learn to fly  
Where eagles only dare to try  
We're on the wing  
We dare to win  
We see the future and we're gonna make it  
Learn to live  
You know you got so much to give  
It's in the air  
It's everywhere  
We got a vision and we're gonna claim it
