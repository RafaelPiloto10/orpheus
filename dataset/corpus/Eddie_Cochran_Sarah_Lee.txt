Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Won't you come along and go with me  
To a place where the lights are bright  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
  
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Won't you come along and go with me  
Baby you're such a pretty sight  
All I wanna do is rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night  
All I wanna do is rock all night  
  
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come along with me  
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Will you, will you, will you, will you say you'll go  
Honey, honey, honey, honey don't say no  
Oowh, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Won't you come along and go with me  
To a place where the lights are bright  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
  
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come along with me  
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Will you, will you, will you, will you say you'll go  
Honey, honey, honey, honey don't say no  
Oowh, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Won't you come along and go with me  
To a place where the lights are bright  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night
