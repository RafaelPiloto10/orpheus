I have been there  
I've been seen there  
And I keep going on  
Telling anyone  
Who'll keep hanging on  
That I don't mind at all  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyway  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know  
  
Ooh my memory  
Always takes me  
Back to way back when  
Things were happening  
Always happening  
All because of you  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyways  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know  
  
When I'm feeling blue  
I sometimes think of you  
Then I'm feeling so much better  
  
I'm wondering  
Was it better then  
Or is it all the same  
Was it happening  
And still happening  
All because of you  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyways  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know
