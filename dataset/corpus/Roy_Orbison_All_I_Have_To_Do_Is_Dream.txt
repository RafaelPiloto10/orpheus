When I want you in my arms when I want you and all your charms whenever I want
you  
All I have to do is dream,dream,dream,dream  
When I feel blue in the night and I want you to hold me tight whenever I want
you  
All I have to do is dream  
I can make you mine taste your lips some wine anytime night or day  
Only trouble is gee whiz  
Im dreamin my life away  
  
I need you so that I could die I love you so  
And that is why whenever I want you all I have to do is  
Dream,dream,dream,dream,dream,dream,dream  
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream  
I need you so that I could die I love you so and that is why whenever I want
you all  
I have to do is dream,dream,dream,dream,dream  
Dream,dream  
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream.
