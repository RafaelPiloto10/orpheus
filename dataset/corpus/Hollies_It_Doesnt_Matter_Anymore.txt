There you go and baby, here am I.  
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry.  
Well, golly gee, what have you done to me?  
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.  
  
Do you remember baby, last September  
How you held me tight, each and every night?  
Well, oh baby, how you drove me crazy.  
I guess it doesn't matter anymore  
  
There's no use in me a-cryin'.  
I've done everything and I'm sick of tryin'.  
I've thrown away my nights,  
Wasted all my days over you  
  
Now you go your way and I'll go mine  
Now and forever till the end of time.  
I'll find somebody new and baby, we'll say we're through  
And you won't matter anymore
