I gave up cigarettes, haven't had to light one yet.  
It's been a year sense I stopped.  
Same goes for alcohol.  
I don't touch the stuff at all.  
I used to drink till I dropped.  
  
[CHORUS:]  
But those were tough this is easy, and it feels  
So good to say. Forgetting you is not that hard to do  
For I've done it a thousand times a day. Oh I've done it a  
Thousand times a day.  
  
Friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind.  
Some said I'd never let you go. But, I guess I've proved  
Them wrong. One more bad habit gone.  
Just like the whiskey and the smokes.  
But those were tough this is easy, and I'm  
All right I'm ok.  
Forgetting  
  
(CHORUS:)  
  
I've given you up for good, just like I said I would.  
Oh the night you walked away.  
But that was tough this is easy,  
  
( CHORUS:)
