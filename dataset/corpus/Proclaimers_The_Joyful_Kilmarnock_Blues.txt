I'm not going to talk about doubts and confusion  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
I'd never been to Ayrshire  
I hitched down one saturday  
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock  
To see Hibernian play  
The day was bright and sunny  
But the game I won't relay  
And there was no Kilmarnock Bunnet  
To make me want to stay  
  
But I'm not going to talk about it  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
When I started walking at Wishaw  
My eyes obscured my vision  
After five miles on my way  
I began to learn to listen  
  
I walked through the country  
I walked through the town  
I held my head up  
And I didn't look down  
The question doesn't matter  
The answer's always "aye"  
The best view of all  
Is where the land meets the sky.
