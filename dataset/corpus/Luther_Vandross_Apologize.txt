Your love's never been better  
So good it's a sin  
But it's time for a decision  
Is it me or him?  
Before you make your mind up, hear me  
I just want you to see things clearly  
This should be about love, not money  
Don't let him try to take you from me  
I don't want to have to apologize  
I don't want to feel I've been penalized  
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car  
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar  
He says that I can only give you  
Material things, but that's not true  
You see my heart is rich with love for you  
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you  
Yeah, baby  
I work hard for my money  
No one gave it to me  
But some fools think the deeper the pocket  
The smaller the heart will be, not true  
I'm only tryin' to share me with you  
Look at all the lovin' we do  
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'  
I'm not just another player playin'  
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn)  
And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am)  
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things  
Or take you anyplace  
That's just what money brings  
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love  
'Cause that's what he would do  
He thinks since he's a man with nothing  
That he's got better love for you  
No way  
Tell him now, let him go  
Or I can no longer be yours  
Tell him how you feel about me  
I can't keep standing on the side  
Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me  
Leave him with his fallacies  
I don't care what bull he believes  
Tell him that enough is enough  
Just don't return a disbeliever  
You've always been a willing receiver of my love  
I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this)  
I don't want to feel like I'm penalized (for being rich)  
Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand  
I'm bein' my true self  
Just doin' what I can  
He thinks I won you with materiality  
But honey, you know that's not so  
And even if he understood me  
It's simply time for him to go, so let him go!  
I don't want to change you  
'Cause I'm in love with who you are  
So I don't want to apologize for bein' a superstar  
Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?  
What am I guilty of?  
What did or didn't I do?  
Maybe I can't be myself with somebody  
Who believes such things are true  
I'm losing self-respect from trying  
I'm losing my desire too I can't do it  
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn)  
I don't want to feel I've been penalized (for who I am)  
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things  
Or take you anyplace  
That's just what money brings  
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love  
'Cause that's what he would do
