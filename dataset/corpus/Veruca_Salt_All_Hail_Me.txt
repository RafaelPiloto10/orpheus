Oh  
So sorry lady  
So sorry now  
I've killed your baby  
I don't know how  
  
So sorry  
So sorry now  
  
So sorry mister (oh oh)  
But don't look now (oh oh)  
I've got your sister (sister)  
I shot her down  
  
So sorry  
So sorry now  
  
'Cause I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
  
All hail me  
  
So sorry mother  
I've let you down  
I'm soaked in blood here  
I can't get out  
  
So sorry  
So sorry now  
  
'Cause I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
I'm a bad man  
I do what I can  
  
All hail me  
  
Oh I'm melting  
Melt your baby  
That did not work so very well
