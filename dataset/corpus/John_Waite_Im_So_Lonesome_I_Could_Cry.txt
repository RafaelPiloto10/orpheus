Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is whining low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep  
When leaves begin to die  
That means he's lost his will to live  
And I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
As I wonder where you could be tonight  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
Oh I'm so lonesome I could cry  
Oh I'm so lonesome I could cry
