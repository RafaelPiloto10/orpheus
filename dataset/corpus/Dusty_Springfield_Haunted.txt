Ooh, hoo  
I can't eat right  
I can't sleep nights  
Oh, honey look at what you've done to me  
Life is nowhere  
And it's no fair  
'Cause you've got me by the memory  
  
Oh, now I feel you near me  
And see your face  
In my dreams  
Every hour all night through  
Oh, I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you  
  
There ain't no doubt  
I can't get out  
Of this trouble that you've got me in  
If I hurt you  
Didn't mean to  
Oh, and I'm sorry  
Ain't the word I've been  
And if you don't come back to me pretty soon  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
'Cause I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you, woah, oh  
  
Oh, I just can't forget you  
'Cause you haunt me everywhere I go  
Oh I'm begging you  
Don't say no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
And if you don't come back to me pretty soon  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
'Cause I'm haunted  
Said I'm haunted,ooh, haunted by you  
Oh, haunted by you  
Haunted by you  
Haunted by you-hoo  
Haunted by you  
Oh, haunted by you  
Baby, haunted by you  
Ooh, by you
