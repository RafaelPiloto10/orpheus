Goin' home, goin' home,  
I am goin' home,  
Quiet light, some still day,  
I am goin' home.  
  
It ain't far, Jes' close by,  
Through an open door,  
Work all done, care laid by,  
Goin' t' fear no more.  
  
Mother's there, 'spectin' me,  
Father's waitin' too,  
Lots o' folks gathered there,  
All the friends I knew.  
  
Nothin's lost, all is gain,  
No more fret nor pain,  
No more stumblin' on the way,  
No more sweat n' strain.  
  
Mornin' star lights the way,  
Restless dream all done,  
Shadows gone, break of day,  
Real life has begun.  
  
There's no break, there's no end,  
Just a livin' on,  
Wide awake with a smile,  
Goin' on an' on.  
  
Goin' home, goin' home,  
I am goin' home.  
Here am I, all alone,  
I am goin' home.  
  
I am goin' home.

By slaves who were nearing death.
