So come sit down  
Will you talk with me now?  
Let me see through your eyes  
Where there is so much life  
  
We are biding our time  
For these myths to unwind  
These changes we will confront  
  
So please beware  
With every place that you had  
Look to your soul  
For these things that you know  
  
For the trees that we see  
Cannot forever breathe  
With the changes they will confront  
  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
  
This sacred land it has  
Seen many hands, it has  
Wealth and gold yet it is  
Fragile and old and all the  
  
Greedy souls just don't care to know  
Of the changes it will confront  
  
So speak out loud of the  
Things you are proud  
And if you love this coast  
Keep it clean as it evolves  
  
'Cause the way that it shines  
May just dwindle with time  
With the changes it will confront  
  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
  
So hold nice and close  
The ones that get to your soul  
So that when it is cold  
You wont feel so alone  
  
'Cause the roads that you take  
May just crack and break  
With the changes you will confront  
  
With each gift that you share  
You may heal and repair  
With each choice that you make  
You may help someone's day  
  
Well I know you are strong  
May your journey be long  
Now I wish you the best of luck  
Well I know you are strong  
  
May your journey be long  
And now I wish you the best of luck
