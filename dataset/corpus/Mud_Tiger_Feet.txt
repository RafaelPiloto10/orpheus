Yeah, yeah  
  
All night long, you've been looking at me  
Well you know you're the dance hall cutie that you love to be  
Oh well now, you've been laying it down  
You've got your hips swinging out of bounds  
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Alright  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right I really love your
tiger light  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, I really love your tiger
feet  
I really love your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Well alright  
  
Well flash your warning lights just as long as you like  
I know you're aching to be making me tonight  
I've got a feeling in my knees  
It's a feeling only you can please  
There ain't no way I'm gonna let you outta my sight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's right, (that's right), that's right, (that's right)  
I really love your tiger light  
That's neat, (that's neat), that's neat, (that's neat)  
I really love your tiger feet  
I really love your tiger feet  
Well alright well now, you've been laying it down  
You've got your hips swinging out of bounds  
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me alright  
  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right I really love your
tiger light  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, I really love your tiger
feet  
I really love your tiger feet  
I really love your tiger feet  
  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat  
I really love, I really love, I really love, I really love  
I really love your tiger feet.  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat  
I really love, I really love, I really love, I really love  
I really love your tiger feet.
