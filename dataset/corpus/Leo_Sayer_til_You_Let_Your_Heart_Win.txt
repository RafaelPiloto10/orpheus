I could love you but you're hard to touch  
Standing by you I have seen so much  
Ain't it funny how I found the one  
But you pull back to protect a heart born to run  
Passion begs you to oblige them all  
Love escapes you and you watch them fall  
Giving nothing you are left to bleed  
Will you ever recognize I know what you need  
  
I want to hold you tight  
Give you the rest of my life  
You are my heaven  
The river flows to the sea  
Like you could reach out to me  
But I can get in  
Till you let your heart win  
  
Dressed in silence  
To disguise the pain  
Pure emotion doesn't know your name  
Love still haunts you  
Please don't turn away  
I'm with you if you care  
Oh you know, things will change  
  
Cause I want to hold you tight  
And give you the rest of my life  
You are my heaven  
The river flows to the sea  
Like you could reach out to me  
But love can get in  
Till you let your heart win  
(You let your heart win)  
Till let your heart win  
  
Oh let it win  
Let your heart win baby  
Please give in  
Let your heart win baby  
Try and give in, try and give in  
Let your heart  
Let your heart win
