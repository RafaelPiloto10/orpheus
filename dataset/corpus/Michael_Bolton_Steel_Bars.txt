In the night I hear you speak  
Turn around, you're in my sleep  
Feel your hands inside my soul  
You're holding on and you won't let go  
  
I've tried running, but there's no escape  
Can't bend them, and I just can't break these  
  
[Chorus]  
Steel bars, wrapped all around me  
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me  
I'm bound forever till the end of time  
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine  
  
Trying hard to recognize  
See the face behind the eyes  
Feel your haunting ways like chains  
'Round my heart they still remain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And with every step I take  
Every desperate move I make  
It's clear to me  
What can all my living mean  
When time itself is so obscene  
When time itself don't mean a thing?  
I'm still loving you  
  
[Chorus]
