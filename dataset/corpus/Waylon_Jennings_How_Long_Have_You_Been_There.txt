I've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun could shine  
I've turned away from everything and everyone that wanted to be mine  
Somehow I always shot my eyes and heart to anything that I might share  
Now I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been there  
Every path I've taken, I've turned around and quickly closed the door  
It seems that all I knew if I ever stop to feel I want more  
I kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhere  
Now I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been there  
How long have you been standing there protecting me from love  
That shouldn't be, knowing all alone that I would realize  
That you were meant for me  
Now I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burned  
And clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learn  
For now I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to care  
Now I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been there  
Now I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been there
