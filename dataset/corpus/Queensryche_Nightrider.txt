Beware of night for we all know he's loose again  
Behind him lies the eyes of mercy and despair  
Forever living out his nightmare comes to life  
From hell this spell will find its way to you  
Tonight  
Tonight  
  
A thousand cries are heard, they echo in the wind  
And still the rider will unleash his chosen sin  
The victims of his rage are soldiers of his mind  
His scream will heed the call of those who stand behind  
  
The nightrider sails away  
The nightrider sails yeah  
  
By day the rider will have vanished from all eyes  
Seen from within the only answer to him lies  
But as the rays of light begin to fade away  
The rider will return to carry out his stay  
  
The nightrider sails away  
The nightrider sails yeah  
  
Beware of the night  
Beware of the night  
Beware of the night  
Oh god, beware of the night
