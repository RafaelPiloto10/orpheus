Hey hoes ain't shit  
And money ain't nothin'  
And if it ain't nothin'  
Then its gotta be somethin'  
And if it ain't somethin'  
Then its gotta be nothin'  
And if he ain't showed the cash  
Then he gotta be bluffin'  
My dog hit me up  
He say he gotta lick  
Gotta bad jump shot  
So he might shoot a brick  
Talkin' records on my line  
That's a technical foul  
Don't know what the fuck you talkin' bout  
I'm hangin' up right now  
Nigga you ain't nick cannon  
And this ain't wild and out  
Playin my position  
I ain't tryin' to foul out  
Instant replay yeah  
We bout to find out  
Hey where the referee  
I need to call the time out  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
If young is what they want  
Then young is what they gettin'  
They ask me what I do I tell em teachin' for a livin'  
What you say nigga  
I could show you how to make a mill right now  
And I could show you how to make a mill right now  
  
He say he just touched down  
And he need a dutch downed  
Second time he caught a date  
Think he goin' out a way  
Thirty six skyline  
We goin' for the fresh down  
Fresh planned defense  
Every time he come around  
We goin' to the super bowl  
If I make this field goal  
I understand you gotta beat  
Let me turn this knee to three  
He trippin' bout the extra point  
Make sure you bring my extra cash  
Next time I see your extra ass  
Hold up call the play  
Yeah I'm playin' quarterback  
4 way 2 way bet I bring a quarter back  
Weigh it up bag it up pass it to my runnin' back  
I got short on my pay  
That's a flag yell this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ninth inning bases loaded  
I'm going for the grand slam  
Tax free tax free  
Don't give a shit to Uncle Sam  
Youngin' playin' softball  
You playin' softball  
Yeah I'm playin' softball  
Same colors golf balls  
Catch me in the outfield  
That's a whole lot of grass  
Tryin' to buy a franchise  
That's a whole lot of cash  
Yeah that's right I'm savin' up  
Think I'm gonna buy the team  
Watch me get my bounty on  
Trying to get my money clean  
Always quick watch the bitch  
Cant afford another strike  
If I make it through this shit  
Then I can play another night  
Money fight money fight  
Gotta get my money right  
But first I gotta kick these hoes  
So make sure that you ridin' wit me  
  
[Chorus]
