James Dean, James Dean, I know just what you mean.  
James Dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
You were the low down rebel if there ever was  
Even if you had no cause.  
James dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator,  
You were just too cool for school.  
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop,  
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules.  
  
James Dean, James Dean, so hungry and so lean.  
James Dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
Little James Dean up on the screen  
Wonderin' who he might be.  
Along came a spyder, picked up a rider,  
Took him down the road to eternity.  
  
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.  
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.  
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.  
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Too fast to live too young to die  
Oo-oo-oo-oo too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Oh, James Dean too fast to live too young to die
