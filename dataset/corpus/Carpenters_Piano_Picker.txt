Everybody always asks me  
How I got to play so fine  
And friends, I'm gonna tell ya  
It really did take some time  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And a case of real bad knees  
While the other guys were out playin' with the football  
I was home bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right were I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you, and I'll try and sing right too  
  
I guess I'm really very lucky  
That I've got this thing to play  
'Cause it can really make me feel good  
Even when it's cloudy and grey  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And awful allergies that made me sneeze  
And now the other guys are out playin' with their girlfriends  
And I was still bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right where I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you  
And I'll try and sing right too
