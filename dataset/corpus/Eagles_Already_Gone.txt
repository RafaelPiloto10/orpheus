Well, I heard some people talking just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
Well, let me tell you I've got some news for you  
And you'll soon find out it's true  
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-ling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right  
And I'm-al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eeling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free  
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains  
That we never even know we have the key  
Me, I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song, coz I'm already gone  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, coz I'm al-ready gone  
Yes, I'm already gone, already gone (awright, nighty night)  
Already gone, already gone
