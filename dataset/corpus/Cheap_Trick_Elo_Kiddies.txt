Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when the lights start shining?  
Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your head's exploding?  
  
So you missed some school?  
You know school's for fools  
Today money rules  
And everybody steals it  
  
Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your stomach's burning?  
Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when your guts start churning?  
  
You lead a life of crime  
You gotta go unwind  
You haven't got much time  
You know they're out to get you  
  
Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
What ya gonna do when you get religion?  
Elo kiddies, elo kiddies  
Hope you didn't get it on the television
