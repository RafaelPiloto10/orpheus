You win, I lose  
I beg, you choose  
You're so cool and I'm confused  
I'm me and you're you  
You're so loose and I'm uptight  
You're day, I'm night  
  
Like two ships in the night in foggy weather,  
Just a waitin' for fresh winds to blow.  
Maybe we're losin' one another  
I could be wrong I don't know  
  
You get the best, I get the rest  
You pass the test, I'm just a mess  
You got it made, I'm in the shade  
Like two ships in the night  
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle  
Just a wonderin' why it don't go  
We could be losin' one another  
I could be wrong I don't know  
  
I know you're tryin' to phase me  
It's gonna drive me crazy  
I can't wait for the day when  
  
I win, You lose  
You beg and I choose  
You're in the shade, I'm on parade  
  
Like two ships in the night
