To him it may be over  
But for her it'll be one day at a time  
He may call it freedom  
But to her he's still locked inside her mind  
You can throw away love's golden pen  
'Cause that's all she wrote  
The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame, what a sight  
A good love died tonight.  
  
To him it's just and ending  
But to her the pain's beginning to start  
For him it's just a walk away  
But for her it's a breaking heart  
One goodbye and lots of tears  
Are all she has left to show  
For those seven years  
That just walked out the door  
A lot of dreams lost their lives when  
A good love died tonight.  
  
They were headed for forever  
When the hope that they were riding left the track  
All the pleading and believing in the world  
Won't bring the feeling back  
You can throw away love's golden pen  
'Cause that's all she wrote  
The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame, what a sight  
A good love died tonight.  
  
What a shame, what a sight  
A good love died tonight...
