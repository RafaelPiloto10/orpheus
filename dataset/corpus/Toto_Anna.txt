Anna please turn around, we'll work it out somehow  
Anna don't turn me down, there's still a chance if we can hold out once more  
  
'Cause we started out with love, that was more than enough  
And that's a lot to give up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Even if you turn and walk away, love will bring you back somehow  
I will wait forever and a day, 'cause I believe without a doubt  
The time will not run out on our love  
  
Anna you gotta stay, it's just a stage we're going through  
And Anna this all can change, if we turn the page then we can start all again  
  
'Cause we almost touched the sky, and it could never again be this right  
Anna please change your mind  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
And I believe without a doubt, the time will not run out  
And I believe without a doubt, the time will not run out on our love
