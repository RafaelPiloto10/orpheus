Love, can't you see I'm alone  
Can't you give this fool a chance  
A little love is all I ask  
A little kindness in the night  
  
Please don't leave me behind  
No, don't tell me love is blind  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
Ooh love, I've been searchin' so long  
I've been searchin' high and low  
And little love is all I ask  
A little sadness when you go  
  
Maybe you'll need a friend  
Only please don't let's pretend  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls  
The pretty girls go sailin' by  
  
Ocean deep  
I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep  
Ocean deep  
  
Now, can't you hear when I call  
Can't you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feelin' when we touch  
  
Why am I still alone  
I've got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls  
The pretty girls go sailin' by  
  
Ocean deep  
I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep  
Ocean deep  
  
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely (Ocean deep)  
On my own in my room  
I'm so lonely  
(Ocean deep)  
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely  
This love of mine  
I'll be ocean deep  
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely  
In my room
