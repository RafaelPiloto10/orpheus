Once again to strive, to beat it out  
Over and over again.  
So worn, worked over  
With the intention to kill.  
To watch him die and smile  
At his dismay,  
His pain,  
My deliverance.  
My cleanliness a gift of freedom.  
My walk purified.  
My peace given by God.  
  
What else is there  
After slipping away,  
When every thing is silent  
And nothing else is around?  
Alone.  
Looking deep inside.  
Hearing the echo of my soul,  
No one can know.  
  
In these times of silence,  
These times of separation,  
I find there is a void that rises up,  
A peace that brings my tears,  
A comfort that no one else can offer.  
  
So why do people run away?  
Why do they look elsewhere  
And base their self on opinions  
When the truth is so evident that this God of  
Love is so constant?  
Destruction and storms.  
My Jesus stands to help
