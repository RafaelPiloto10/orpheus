Do you remember  
Back in nineteen sixty-six?  
Country Jesus, hillbilly blues,  
That's where I learned my licks.  
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line  
In every county there,  
I'm talkin' 'bout that outlaw X  
Is cuttin' through the air.  
  
Anywhere, y'all,  
Everywhere, y'all,  
I heard it, I heard it,  
I heard it on the X.  
  
We can all thank Doctor be  
Who stepped across the line.  
With lots of watts he took control,  
The first one of its kind.  
So listen to your radio  
Most each and every night  
'cause if you don't I'm sure you won't  
Get to feeling right.  
  
Anywhere, y'all,  
Everywhere, y'all,  
I heard it, I heard it,  
I heard it on the X.
