There are no unlockable doors  
There are no unwinable wars  
There are no unrightable wrongs  
Or unsingable songs  
There are no unbeatable odds  
There are no believable gods  
There are no unnameable names  
Shall I say it again, yeah  
There are no impossible dreams  
There are no invisible seams  
Each night when the day is through  
I don't ask much I just want you I just want you  
There are no uncriminal crimes  
There are no unrhymable rhymes  
There are no identical twins or forgivable sins  
There are no incurable ills  
There are no unkillable thrills  
One thing and you know it's true,  
I don't ask much I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired  
I used to go to bed so high and wired, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think I'll buy myself some plastic water  
I guess I should have married Lennon's daughter, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah  
There are no unachievable goals  
There are no unsaveable souls  
No legitimate kings or queens, do you know what I mean?  
Yeah  
There are no indisputable truths  
And there ain't no fountain of youth  
Each night when the day is through,  
I don't ask much  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you  
I just want you.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I just want you  
I just want you,  
Hey, yeah  
I just want you.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I just want you, hey  
I just want you  
I just want you
