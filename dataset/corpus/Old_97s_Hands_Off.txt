Hands off  
I had a dream they took my hands off  
Although you probably think that I'm soft boiled  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Girlfriend, don't sit 'round waiting for the world to end  
I'll keep my distance but I won't pretend  
I'm not in love with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it's all your fault. You spiked my malt  
You slipped a mickey in my heart  
And I can't shake free, although I'm shaking like a tree  
I should've never let it, I should've never let it start  
  
Deep end. I guess I'm going off the deep end  
It's only 'cause you've got a hand to lend  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Crap shoot. You've got the snake eyes and lizard boots  
I like you better in your birthday suit, yeah  
I'm in love with you.  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
Hands off. I shot another leaded star
