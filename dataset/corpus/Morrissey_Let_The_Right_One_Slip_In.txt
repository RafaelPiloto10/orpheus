Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They cannot  
They cannot  
They cannot do what you want them to do  
Oh...  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They do not  
They do not  
They do not see what you want them to  
Oh...  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old things fade  
Put the tricks and schemes (for good) away  
  
Ah...I will advise  
Ah...Until my mouth dries  
Ah...I will advise you to...  
  
Ah...let the right one slip in  
Slip in  
Slip in  
  
And when at last it does  
I'd say you were within your rights to bite  
The right one and say, "what kept you so long?"  
"What kept you so long?"  
Oh...
