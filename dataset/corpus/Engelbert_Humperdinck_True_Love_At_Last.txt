Don't go away yet  
I haven't felt this dead in years  
This room's full of people  
With drinks in their hands, and nothing but nothing to say  
  
Don't go away yet  
It seems like everyone I love is gone  
I'm praying for some kind of change  
Nothing's changed, and nothing will change  
  
Don't leave me now, you are the only thing left to believe in  
Don't let me down, you are the last thing that I feel complete in  
  
Don't go away yet  
True love is dying off  
Where everyone is searching  
I'm just a face in the crowd  
  
Said you wanted distance, this is what you get  
The distance was half near far enough  
(I could take it all if you come back, I dreamed of you and it came true)
