I've been feeling kind of down and loose  
Like a Rosicrucian pope  
Head down deep in the womb of time  
Carrying a message of hope  
My hands steady as a hangman's hands  
Surer than the hangman's rope  
I could sleep for invisible years  
Carrying a message of hope  
For the future  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope  
  
I found a power on a dusty shelf  
Hey! the languages I learned  
Now I'm so powerful I hurt myself  
I hurt myself  
I feel kind of limbic brain  
Like the library of an astronaut  
Found hidden in a pyramid  
Shadowing a body of thought  
  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope  
  
Madam I'm Adam, I'm a palindrome  
Never odd or even any time  
Fishin' and smilin' like a garden gnome  
Twisting tales and spinning lines  
Why don't we twist like we did last year?  
  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope
