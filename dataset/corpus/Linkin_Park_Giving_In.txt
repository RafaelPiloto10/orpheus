Will you, walk me to the edge again?  
Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again  
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me  
I'm giving in to you  
  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
  
Caught up, in life  
Losing all my friends  
Family has tried, to heal all my addictions  
Tragic it seems, to be alone again  
I'm giving in... To you  
  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
  
I look forward, to dying tonight  
Drink till I'm myself, life's harder every day  
The stress has got me  
I'm giving in  
Giving in  
Giving in now!  
  
Take me under  
(I'm killing all the pain)  
I'm dying tonight  
(I'm sick of all this faith)  
Watch me crumble  
(I'm killing all the pain)  
I'm crying tonight  
  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you
