Now, they saying we're too hot  
New verses please, c'mon Malice  
  
Hot damn, it's a new day  
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man  
Uh-huh of course, 'fore you say what you say, hot damn  
  
My, how the boys roam, from roaming,  
Loc and come home, to homes of his own  
No catching up he's in a whole 'nother zone  
Still true to his roots, stay close to the chrome  
  
Haters stay clear of him, y'all stand cheer for him  
Got up out the game and overcame, let's hear it for him  
Keep a new toy, so, I wonder how could  
I not enjoy life, I'm re-living my childhood  
  
Big chain monsta, whip game bonkas  
Monster truck remind him of Tonka  
Diamond F color, plush gold still gutter  
My dealer's in the mills motherfuck' and I ain't studder  
  
Bitter sweet, my life's a musical  
From holding those to Bose gold, the Lord's beautiful  
Before him I'm too shamed to show my face  
But shit's so, mean I can't help but to fall from grace, motherfucker  
  
Hot damn, it's a new day  
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man  
  
Hot damn, when the white hit the pan it  
Twists and it tumbles it, flips and the fumbles  
I mix it like Gumbo, I pitch it so subtle  
I keep hustlers puzzled, Feds I got em wondering  
(Wondering)  
  
'What Happened To That boy'  
Six maneuver, how'd I slip into that toy  
Is it the pimp, the crook, the hustling thing  
The man, the music that making a king  
  
I'm simply building my Ming  
A million men marchin' like condom [unverified]  
I'm the King Kong, my verse making the world sing  
My heart's on the sleeve for  
  
Your face is just like mine  
Peeking from bars hoping the sun shines on 'em  
But, you still got to watch the phonies  
Watch your homies, we got you homie  
  
Hot damn, it's a new day  
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man  
  
Uhh, handle the rock like none other  
Grits over the stove, head under the cupboard  
In the kitchen till the fume make me feel smothered  
The way it melt fiends, can't believe it's not butter  
  
The way it melt he won't cop from none other  
The he who holds O's like Krispy Kreme's oven  
Or easy bake, pink divvies make  
The presidential should look like strawberry shortcake, P  
  
Imagine that Rolls Royce crashed in, me unscratched in  
That millionaire boys club fashion  
Uh, you niggas is clones  
I hand out styles like ice cream cones, the fuck outta here  
  
That's Pha real, my gats is real  
The sl5 is lookin' like the Batmobile  
Chrome lids with the matching wheels  
Uh, both chains probably match ya deal  
Y'all dudes is an act fa real, Pusha  
  
Hot damn, it's a new day  
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man  
  
Neither the sun or death can be looked at  
That's what an O. G told me  
That was the exact moment I decided to take a pact  
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back  
  
It wasn't nicely expect Rosco to put you back, in place  
I'm what you call a destructive warpath  
It'll be a shell shower in today's forecast  
You a gangsta? I can't tell  
  
You diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it  
Those jewels aren't genuine, 'cause if they was I'm nice with it  
I woulda' been took that  
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda' been shook that  
  
In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn ya  
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax  
My son's home crying, don't give me no slack  
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag  
  
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask  
Coat change not your typical crook  
I'm being watched look at the camera lens in the bush  
  
Hot damn, it's a new day  
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man
