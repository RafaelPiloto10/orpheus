I saw an old lover today on the street  
She said, "Do you remember how we used to be  
On fire with that passion, we'd burn down those nights?"  
No I haven't forgotten how we used to fight  
I finally got married and settled on down  
Yeah she's a preachers daughter in a sleepy little town  
Does she make you laugh since we said goodbye?  
No she ain't that funny but she never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry like you used to  
There's nothing about her that reminds me of you  
I promise I don't see your face when I look in her eyes  
And she never makes me cry  
Does she make you beg for her love in the night?  
No, she ain't that selfish and she never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry like you used to  
There's nothing about her that reminds me of you  
I promise I don't see your face when I look in her eyes  
She never makes me wonder when she's coming home  
There's something about her like I've never known  
It's been nice to see you but now I must say goodbye  
She never makes me cry, she never makes me cry, no, no  
She never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry
