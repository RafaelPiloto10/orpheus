[Verse 1]  
Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity  
I want to' make sure all's hearin' me  
Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away  
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way  
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud  
On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now  
Kickin' up lyrics that others want to' rock to  
Rock like me, y'all this you can't do  
The v, the a, the n, the i, the lla y'all  
It's vanilla  
[Chorus]  
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up  
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up  
[Verse 2]  
Hold on girl, let your feet move free  
cause you move to the groove of vanilla i-see-e  
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap  
If you a ho, get off my lap  
cause ice stands for bein' so cold  
That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold  
Jerome stands for m.p.a  
My personal assistant, every day  
I'm not an mc who come here to play  
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way  
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill  
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic  
When I see one, I got to have it  
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum  
What you gonna' do? don't you play dumb  
Busy like kizzy, groovin' like rubin  
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'  
Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin  
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin  
Simple like simon, with ice rhymin'  
Some mc's fakin' it, but I'm the diamond  
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call  
You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 4]  
Start skeezin' and move that hip girl  
Get in the mood and don't you quit  
Smooth as slime, king rhyme  
Rock it boy, cause it's a craime  
I'll make you scream like you're in between  
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king  
cause I'm hungry as a dog, i'll eat up  
My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt  
cause I'm a throne overtaker, not an mc faker  
I like my coffee, but I can't stand sanka  
[Chorus]
