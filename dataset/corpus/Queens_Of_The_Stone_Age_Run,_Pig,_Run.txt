When I was young, we used to play the game called hide and seek  
Someone'd go hide, I'd count to ten  
You probably never played, instead you talked a game of sheep  
A skill you almost do perfect  
  
Run, pig, run  
Here I come  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
  
I am no saint and make no claims to being in the right  
It's just for now, I am wrong less  
You're probably wondering with what to do this has with you  
I wanna play the game you missed  
  
Run, pig, run  
Here I come  
  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place to hide  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run
