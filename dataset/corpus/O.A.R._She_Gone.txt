He walks these streets some nights until way past twelve.  
His mind can't decide if he's in heaven...he just can't tell.  
He sees her standing there, smiling by the lamp post shine.  
His heart can't remember ever feeling, oh, so fine.  
  
She gone.  
She not coming back, no way.  
She gone.  
She not coming back to stay.  
  
She gone.  
And as she turns away his eyes lost in her back.  
His feet continue down some ancient railroad track.  
And right then, right there he sees that he's done wrong.  
  
And as he opens his eyes, realizes that she gone.  
Well, she gone, she not coming back, no way.  
She gone, she not coming back to stay.  
Well, she gone, she never coming back again.  
  
She gone, what's he gonna do 'til then?  
She gone.  
She gone.  
She gone.  
  
She gone so far away.  
She gone.
