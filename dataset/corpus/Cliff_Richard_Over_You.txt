Don't want to be left behind left alone  
Waiting for you to call me  
Don't want to have best of times haunting me  
Underlining my heartache  
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals  
Leaving me free of the hold that you have on me  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
I talk to your answer phone it's telling me  
Please leave your number  
I'll call when I get back home  
When you hear the tone speak up and clearly  
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals  
But who do I turn to if you won't return my calls  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
I call your home and your answer phone  
Tells me leave your number  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
Over you I just must get  
Over you but how will I get  
Over you I guess I'll get  
Over you it may take some time getting  
Over you I may never get  
Over you just must get  
Over you...
