Mmm, when I see the winter  
Turning into spring,  
Oh, it speaks to this heart of mine  
More than anything.  
Underneath a blanket of snow  
Cold and white,  
Something is stirring in the still of the night.  
When the sun comes up  
Slowly with the dawn,  
Oh, this is the common feeling  
That I hang my hope up on.  
There is a love and beauty  
In all that I see  
And no one, nobody  
Is explaining you to me.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.  
  
When the evening sun  
Slowly fades to red  
Time and time and time again  
I whisper in my head.  
Give me grace  
Give me strength  
To firmly believe  
That the maker of this whole wide world is a father to me.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.
