Maybe I shouldn't have spoken  
Just kept my mouth shut  
Maybe all the effort didn't help much  
Singing for better conditions  
Hoping for better days  
Not saying that we're perfect  
Or looking for some praise  
Gossip, rumors just plain lies  
But we're on the same side  
Gossip, rumors let's put it aside  
Fuck we're on the same side  
Knowing if I stumble  
Aware if I fall  
I don't need finger pointed at me  
If you're not trying at all  
Not trying to come off righteous  
Just always tried to be sincere  
Didn't mean to come off so well-learned  
Cause I'm just another peer  
Gossip, rumors just plain lies  
But we're on the same side  
Gossip, rumors let's put it aside  
Fuck we're on the same side  
I know what I'm shooting for (PUT IT ASIDE)  
I know how it felt  
And I don't have to prove it to anybody  
Because I already proved it to myself  
No matter where I am in this world  
I know exactly where I stand  
I thought we were on the same side man  
But at least I know I've tried
