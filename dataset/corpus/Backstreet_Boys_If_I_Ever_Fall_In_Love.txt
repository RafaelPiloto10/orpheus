The very first time  
That I saw your brown eyes  
Your lips said hello and I said hi  
I knew right then you were the one  
But I was caught up  
In physical attraction  
But to my satisfaction  
Baby you were more than just a face  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
Oh, yeah, the very next time shell be my friend  
  
If I say that I will be your one and only  
(promise, promise) promise that you'll never leave me lonely  
I just wanna be the one you need  
Oh, baby  
I just wanna be the one who serves you  
Sometime I feel as if I don't deserve you  
I cherish every moment that we share  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
(repeat)  
Very next time she will be my friend  
Someone who I can believe in  
  
(my friend)  
I need someone wholl be my friend  
(my friend)  
To be with me through thick and thin  
(my friend)  
Please share my love with me my friend  
I need someone like you  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you
