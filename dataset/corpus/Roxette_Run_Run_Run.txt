Go! Go!  
She wants you every time that you pass her by.  
Go! Go!  
And wishing you could stay with her by her side.  
Go! Go!  
You got a piece of her heart, now, you shouldn't refuse.  
Go! Go!  
You came out to win, now you're bound to lose.  
She's gonna run run run 'cos here you go and break her heart.  
She's gonna run run run before you start to tear it apart.  
Go! Go!  
Fire in your eyes, a new love is burning.  
Go! Go!  
But she's not gonna be there when it comes to returning.  
Go! Go!  
She's dreaming alone in this lonely world.  
Go! Go!  
You give all you got to another girl.  
She's gonna run run run 'cos here you go and break her heart.  
She's gonna run run run before you start to tear it apart.
