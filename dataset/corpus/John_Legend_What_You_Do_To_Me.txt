[Verse 1]  
Go from zero to a hundred and up it crazy  
Don't believe it when you say that you fuckin' hate me, no  
Use your tongue to crucify me, you motivate me, oh I  
Throwing down when it ends up with your legs around me  
Your legs around me, oh  
I rise, you fall, we wreck it all  
My pride is at your beck and call  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
  
[Verse 2]  
I could stop, I could leave, but no, I don't wanna  
It's a mess I'm obsessed with your kind of torture  
It's my kind of torture  
Oh, I rise, you fall, we wreck it all  
You kill me with every kiss and don't you know...  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't know how you take control of me baby  
I don't know how you got a hold  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
(Yeah, that's what you do to me)  
Make me love and hate you at....  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
Oh, that's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time, at the same time, at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me
