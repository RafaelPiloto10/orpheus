Now get the fuck up off me nigga  
  
As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure  
I'm 'posed ta, propose a toast to players on every coast-a  
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender  
'Stead of watching these sucker MC's  
I'm seeing just how they lying to the general population  
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life  
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?  
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined  
To the situation, we facing, cause in time, tick tick boom  
  
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom  
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom  
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom  
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom  
  
"You're gonna die here"  
  
When will we all, awake up out this dream  
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings  
Man acting as if he was the supreme being  
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and  
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow  
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars  
Politicians, modern day magicians  
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health  
Who making us ill, they making us kill  
That's making me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)  
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled  
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel  
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal  
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed  
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED  
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!  
  
"Can't be heard clearly"  
"You're gonna die here"  
  
Operation Anaconda, ask yourself  
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?  
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price  
For his life and his wife plead twice?  
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton  
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers  
They got they answer for ransom  
As we read together, as we dream together  
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better  
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you  
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you  
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin'  
I'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen  
Now eat nigga!
