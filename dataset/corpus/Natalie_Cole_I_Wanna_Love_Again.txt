Ah, baby  
How do I start? Where do I begin?  
I've been hurt so much, I just need a friend  
Could it be you? Will you break through these walls?  
Are you willing to help them fall?  
  
I want to love again, but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want love again and this time with you  
  
I didn't know that this would be so hard for me  
Being this close to you is driving me crazy  
My mind says no, oh, but my body says yes  
You make one move and I'll do the rest  
  
I want to love again, but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want to love again and this time with you  
  
Oh, it's been so long, since I've seen your face  
And I'm just trying to be strong  
Oh, but I think about you everyday  
And it makes me weak when I see your face  
I guess it means, I'm in a different space  
Cause I wanna love again and this time with you  
  
I want to love again but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle, gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want to love again  
  
Please let me love again  
I want to love again  
And this time with you  
I just wanna love again with you
