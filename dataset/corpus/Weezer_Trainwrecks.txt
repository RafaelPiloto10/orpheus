We sleep all day and rock the night  
We just get up to start another fight  
We kiss and then we bite  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
You don't keep passing up a slob  
Get freaky now 'cause I can't keep a job  
We don't update our blogs  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
People love to tell us what to do  
That's just 'cause they're jealous of me and you  
  
We're digging through the couch for cash  
We're taking cabs 'cause both our cars are trashed  
But we're still kicking ass  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
We think it's uncool to be on time  
Mooching off our friends is not a federal crime  
  
Someday we'll cut our critics down to size  
And crash a Diddy party in disguise  
We fall but then we rise  
We are Trainwrecks  
Trainwrecks  
  
That's the story of our lives  
We are Trainwrecks
