Well I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside like my heart's sprung a big
break  
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake  
Now you might say that I was takin' it hard that he wrote me off with a call  
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow when I may break right down and
bawl  
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch  
Heartaches are going to the inside  
My tears are holdin' back they're tryin' not to fall  
My heart's out of the runnin' true love scratched for another's sake  
The race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all  
[ guitar - steel ]  
One day I ventured in love never once suspectin' what the final result would
be  
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning and findin' that you're gone
from me  
Cause there's ache and pain in my heart for today was the one that I hated to
face  
Somebody new came up to win him and I came out in second place  
Now the race is on...
