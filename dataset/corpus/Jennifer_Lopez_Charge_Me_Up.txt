Running out of juice  
It's a matter of seconds now  
I'm shutting down  
Desperate when I mo-ove  
My battery is screaming loud  
I'm shutting down  
Its an addiction  
I I I want more more more  
Give me some boom boom boom  
Give me some oh oh oh  
Keeps up my engine with a hundred thousand volts  
Ignite the room room room  
I'm going loco loco loco  
  
Throw me down like lightning volts  
Take control of my body every single bone  
I come alive when you charge me up baby  
Charge me up baby charge me up once and again  
I'm dancing in the danger zone  
So wired up but I just want another dose  
I come alive when you charge me up baby  
Charge me up baby charge me up once and again  
  
Oh oh oh charge me up once and again  
Oh oh oh charge me up once and again  
  
This is my disease my predatory instinct call  
I'm bout' to fall oh oh oh  
Shock me fill me up  
Proceed Ill give you all you want, I'm bout to fall  
Its an addiction  
I I I want more more more  
Give me some boom boom boom  
Give me some oh oh oh  
Keeps up my engine with a hundred thousand volts  
Ignite the room room room I'm going loco loco loco  
  
Throw me down like lightning volts  
Take control of my body every single bone  
I come alive when you charge me up baby  
Charge me up baby charge me up once and again  
I'm dancing in the danger zone  
So wired up but I just want another dose  
I come alive when you charge me up baby  
Charge me up baby charge me up once and again  
  
Oh oh oh charge me up once and again  
Oh oh oh charge me up once and again  
  
Running real low  
I'm moving in slow mo  
Charge me up, shift me up, I need a reload
