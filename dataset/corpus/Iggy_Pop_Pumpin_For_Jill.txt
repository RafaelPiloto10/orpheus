When I'm asleep, you touch my feet  
You let me know that I am no creep  
Because I love you, you are for real  
I'm gonna stay here, pumping for Jill  
In the gas station where I work  
Everyone treats me just like a jerk  
Nobody offers me a tip  
I'm gonna stay here, pumping Jill's hips  
  
I met you out at the Mardi Gras  
On a French Quarter sidewalk  
When you kissed me, it was strong  
I wonder if you'll hear this song
