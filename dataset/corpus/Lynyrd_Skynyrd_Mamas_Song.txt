She'd wake us up early  
Every mornin'  
She'd help us say our prayers  
Every night  
She was always there to help us  
Through the hard times  
We could count on her  
To make everything alright  
  
I remember swingin' on the front porch  
Papa said, there's somethin  
I need to say tonight  
Mama's been sick for a long time  
Let's pray to God  
She can make it through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
"Mama don't wanna say goodbye"  
She said  
"Wipe those tears from your eyes"  
"Mama, I don't wanna say goodbye"  
It was written in the heavens  
And the skies above  
"Son, I gave you birth  
Showed you all my love"  
"I can't think of this life without you  
It's hard to try  
Mama, I'm afraid to say goodbye"  
  
"Now kids  
I've been hangin' on a long time  
I hate to leave this world  
Before you're grown  
Remember everything  
That I've taught you  
Remember all the good times  
When I'm gone"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She whispered in my ear  
Before she passed away  
"Son, it's time to be a man  
Ain't nothin' left to say  
Jesus walked on water, I know it's true  
When it comes time, he'll call you home  
I hope you're ready too"  
  
[Chorus]
