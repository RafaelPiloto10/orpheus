There's an emptiness between us  
Been filling up for days  
It's heavy on my mind  
Fighting all the time  
We never find our way  
You swore you would remember  
What a shame you had to lie  
Now this battle that you're in  
Is underneath your skin  
And the fight is in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
But one day  
You'll fall down  
And there won't  
Be anyone to pick you up again  
But one day  
You'll fall down  
And there won't  
Be anyone  
  
You know this ain't pretend now  
I'd fix it if I could  
So pack up all your things  
Drop off all your rings  
Things have changed for good  
You swore you would protect me  
And you swore you would not lie  
Now the battle that we're in  
In in between locked doors  
And the fight is in our eyes  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
All these lonely days  
Lead to lonely nights  
And on lonely nights I sleep  
Trapped inside  
What became my life  
And it's all because of me  
  
But one day  
You'll fall down  
And there won't  
Be anyone to pick you up again  
But one day  
You'll fall down  
And there won't  
Be anyone anywhere now  
One day  
You'll fall down  
And there won't  
Be anyone to pick you up again  
  
(One day you'll fall down)  
Be there to pick you up again  
(And there won't)  
Be there to pick up up again  
  
[Chorus: x 2]
