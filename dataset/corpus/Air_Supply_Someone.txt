When you first found love  
Was it all that you had wanted  
For a thousand lonely years  
Was the memory so sweet  
Now your scented touch brings me  
Back to the enchanted  
All shadows fade away  
The gypsy is complete  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone is walking beside me  
Someone is waiting till I say yes I do  
Someone is living inside me  
Giving me all that I need and I need you  
Someone to cry on my shoulder  
I just want to stay here forever  
  
From the secret pool  
Did I stare at your reflection  
Let the water wash away all the battle  
From my soul  
For the bride of spring,  
Do I swear to your protection  
Today will be the day that never shall  
Grow old  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silence broken and the blackbird is free  
Only your voice can I hear, speak to me  
  
[Chorus]
