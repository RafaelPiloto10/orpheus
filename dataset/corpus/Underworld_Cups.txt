Bubble girl you feel like a movie  
Bubble blow a bit faster liquid  
Bubble fish take fast now faster  
Bubble fast slow down the slope  
Blue, blue, blue, blue  
  
Little girl  
You chew girl lie on to you?  
Bubble blow bit faster, bit faster christian  
Bubble fast slow down, big slow ?  
A bit faster everything is good  
Dreams of me to liquid dream salty?  
Dream of something quick deep slice to sometime into my hand  
False alarm fools imagine into slow black slow slow fence  
  
Sneak up light across the horizon  
Sneak up last night in moonlight  
Party grasses over the ocean  
I love to write  
Bubble blow you comeback  
You slow down  
Another blow  
Big faster  
Big faster  
Bubble fish take fast now Faster  
Drip slowdown
