Maybe I talk too much,  
Maybe I've lost m' touch.  
I guess I don't know what's cookin'  
'Cause I just can't see for lookin'.  
  
Other boys have their chicks,  
Two, three, four, five or six.  
I don't seem to get a bookin'  
'Cause I just can't see for lookin'.  
  
I'm kinda crazy,  
Like a daisy  
Up that well known tree, poor me.  
I'm sittin', hopin',  
  
Horoscopin'  
Won't some sista take a chance with me?  
I've been around the town,  
Everyone brings me down.  
  
I give up hope, I'm just a dope.  
There ain't no gals for hookin',  
I just can't see for lookin'.  
I've been around the town,  
  
Everyone brings me down.  
I give up hope, I'm just a dope.  
There ain't no gals for hookin',  
I just can't see for lookin'...  
  
No, just can't see for lookin'...  
No, no.
