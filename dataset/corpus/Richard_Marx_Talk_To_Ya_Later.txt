I met her on a strip  
It was another lost weekend  
But the band was too slick  
And the people were twisted  
  
So I asked her for a date  
She reluctantly agreed  
Then we went to my place  
And she never did leave  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
And that's okay with me, I'll cry later on  
  
It's been six months  
She hasn't shut up once  
I've tried to explain  
She's driving me insane  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
That's okay with me, I'll cry later on  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
Get out, I'm telling you now  
Do you catch my drift  
What could be plainer than this  
  
Nothin' more to be said  
Write me a letter instead  
I don't mean to be cruel  
But I'm finished with you  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
That's okay with me I'll cry later on  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight
