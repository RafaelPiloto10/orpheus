So you want to know what's going on  
When we get wild, and we're up until dawn  
The parties and the stories, they're all true  
Ain't nothing left when we're through  
One distant land where it's all sin and sand  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
King of Sodom, I want the flesh  
Gotta have it, I love it to death  
King of Sodom, I eat'em alive  
Like a savage, the strong will survive  
  
Wicked souls, a hunger for lust  
You lay it down, we're goin' for bust  
We live a life, that's hell of wheels  
You don't know how it feels  
Ride the wind, and soon you'll all be in  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Sodom and Gomorrah - ooh, sweet Gomorrah  
We're the present tribe - the present tribe  
Children of the fire - of the fire  
Burning up alive, alive, alive, alive  
  
[REFRAIN:]
