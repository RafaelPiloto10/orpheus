I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
You know I love getting up in the morning  
When the sun first strikes the trees  
All the morning birds are sing above  
Still bring back memories  
Of a girl who stood beside me  
When the rights I did were wrong  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
She never told me why she left me  
But the letter say goodbye  
Now my mornings are for wondering  
And my nights to reason why  
Why the stranger comes to steal the love  
Of a girl I had hold  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
So I sing  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.
