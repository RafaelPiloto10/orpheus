Stop that Train  
I'm a leaving...  
And it won't be too long  
Whether I'm right or wrong  
(CHORUS)  
All my life  
I've been the lonely man  
Teachin people that don't overstand  
And even though I try my best  
I still don't find no happiness  
CHORUS  
Some goin' east  
And a some goin' west  
I see some stand aside  
Just to try their best  
And I say some livin' big  
But the most them livin' small  
And they can't even find  
No No No food at all  
CHORUS  
Stop that train  
Can't take dem ya pressure...
