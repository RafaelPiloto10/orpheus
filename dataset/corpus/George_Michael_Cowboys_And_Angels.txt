When your heart's in someone else's hands  
Monkey see and monkey do  
Their wish is your command  
Not to blame  
Everyone's the same  
  
All you do is love and love is all you do  
I should know by now the way I fought for you  
You're not to blame, everyone's the same  
  
I know you think that you're safe  
Mister  
Harmless deception  
That keeps love at bay  
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss  
Wouldn't you say?  
  
Cowboys and angels  
They all have the time for you  
Why should I imagine that I'd be a find for you  
Why should I imagine  
That I'd have something to say  
  
But that scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
In your heart there's a trace  
Of someone before  
  
When your heart's in someone else's plans  
Things you say and things you do  
That they don't understand  
You're not to blame  
Always ends the same  
  
You can call it love but I don't think it's true  
You should know by now  
I'm not the boy for you  
You're not to blame  
Always ends the same  
  
I know you think that you're safe  
Sister  
Harmless affection that keeps things this way  
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss  
Who will pay and pay  
Cowboys and angels  
They all have the time for you  
Why should I imagine that I was designed for you  
Why should I believe  
That you would stay  
  
But that scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
Don't you think that I'd know  
They've hurt you, before  
  
Take this man to your place  
Maybe his hands can help you forget  
Please be stronger than your past  
The future may still give you a chance  
The future, the future, not the past  
  
That scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
Don't you think that I know  
They hurt you before
