Evergleam and I know why God is good and Jesus loves me  
Heaven lives and I know where  
  
Sounds to me a not so easy chair falling free and living down  
Stringing out and over and happy  
  
Evergleam and I know why it isn't real and I'm not going to break  
Not going to break  
  
Don't die don't give in to it no way no way  
Please don't leave me  
  
Evergleam and I know how pulling hair and breaking voices  
Spin the wheel it will give you now  
  
Spinning wills don't give you choices  
Give away the spark inside, you give away the shining prize  
Evergleam and I know how it isn't real and I'm not going to break  
  
I'm not going to break  
No way, I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna break  
No way  
  
Evergleam, everywhere, ever weird, everyone  
Evergleam, everywhere, everything  
I'm not going away, not going away, not going away  
No way, I'm not gonna break, not gonna break  
No way, I'm not gonna break  
I won't see you there I'm not going away  
No way, no way, no way
