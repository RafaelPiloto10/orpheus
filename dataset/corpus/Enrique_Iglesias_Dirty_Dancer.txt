Enrique, Usher  
This is for the dirty girls  
All around the world  
Here we go  
  
Dirty dirty dancer  
  
'Nother day, 'nother night  
And she acting like she don't sleep  
She's a five when she drinks  
But she's a ten when she's on top of me  
  
She don't want love she just wanna touch  
She's a greedy girl to never get enough  
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch  
Got all the moves that make you get it up  
  
She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
It's a game  
That she plays  
She can win with her eyes closed  
It's insane how she tames  
She can turn you to an animal  
  
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch  
She's a greedy girl to never get enough  
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch  
She's got all the moves to make you get it up  
  
She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
Never be her only  
  
She never satisfied  
You better do it right  
Before you're lonely  
  
No, she's never satisfied  
You better do it right  
Before you're lonely  
  
She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only

You'll never be her only
