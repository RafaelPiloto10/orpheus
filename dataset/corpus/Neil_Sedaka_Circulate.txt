If you're feeling low down 'cause your baby left town,  
Then let me set you straight,  
If your chick's flown the coop, knocked the blues for a loop,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
Go on out and have fun, put the blues on the run,  
You'll find that living is great,  
Just pretend you're a king, balance the world on a string,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea  
Shopping around for a mate,  
Hurry on up, waste no time,  
Come on in, the water's fine.  
  
It's a star spangled world, when your flags are unfurled  
Don't underestimate,  
This advice that I give, it means wake up and live,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
There are plenty of pebbles on the beach,  
Go out and gather a few,  
You can be the cat's meow,  
Start your rock-collection now.  
  
It's a star spangled world, when your flags are unfurled  
Don't underestimate,  
This advice that I give, it means wake up and live,  
Get out and circulate.  
It's a world full of chicks, so get out and mix,  
I said that life's worth living  
So I get your kicks.  
Get out and circulate.
