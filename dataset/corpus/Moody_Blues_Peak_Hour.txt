I see it all through my window it seems.  
Never failing, like millions of eels.  
All that is wrong,  
No time to be won.  
Only to do  
What can be done.  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour.  
Minds are subject to what should be done.  
Problem solved, time cannot be won.  
One hour a day,  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Home-aimed for flight.  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour.  
It makes me want to run out and tell them  
They've got time.  
Take a step back out and warn them  
I've found out I've got time.  
Minds are subject to what should be done.  
Problem solved, time cannot be won.  
One hour a day,  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Home-aimed for flight.  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour,  
Peak hour.
