We don't care what people say  
We know the truth  
Enough is enough with this horse shit  
I am not a freak  
I was born with my freedom  
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom  
  
I'm a bitch, I'm a loser baby, maybe I should quit  
I'm a jerk, wish I had the money but I can't find work  
I'm a brat, I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked  
My parents tried till they got divorced  
'Cause I ruined their lives  
  
I'm a bad kid  
And I'll survive  
Oh I'm a bad kid  
Don't know wrong from right  
I'm a bad kid and this is my life  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
(This is my life)  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
A bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
Don't be insecure  
  
I'm a twit, degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it  
Pump your fist  
If you would rather mess up than put up with this  
I'm a nerd, I chew gum and smoke in your face I'm absurd  
I'm so bad and I don't give a damn, l love it when you're mad  
When you're mad  
When you're mad  
  
I'm a bad kid  
And I will survive  
Oh I'm a bad kid  
Don't know wrong from right  
I'm a bad kid and this is my life  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
(This is my life)  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
Don't be insecure  
  
I'm not that typical baby  
I'm a bad kid like my Mom and Dad made me  
I'm not that cool and you hate me  
I'm a bad kid that's the way that they made me  
  
I'm a bad kid I'm disastrous  
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath  
I'm a bad kid and I will survive  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
A bad kid, baby
