Zero conversation, words upon a page.  
No communication, no respect.  
Zero but a world of words, a war a simple rage.  
Not worth the time to look in or dissect.  
He said  
  
Wait!!! I'm not ready.  
I wasn't really treated fair  
Wait!!! Not in a hurry,  
I want the time I wasted back when I thought no one cared.  
  
Positively negative, zero minus one.  
He believes, he believes in what he say.  
A lifetime in a moment passes, zero minus one.  
Borrowed time, borrow one more day.  
  
Just enough to keep you down,  
Up to zero!  
Just enough to keep you down.  
  
Just enough to keep you down,  
I'm up to zero!  
Just enough to keep you down.  
  
Wasted, wanted, needed, feel,  
When all is said and done.  
Christened, baptized, spitting on the Son.  
Stop it here, one more deal,  
A moment now to beg or steal.  
A scrap of meat or one last meal?  
Stop it here, stop it here, and  
  
Keep you down
