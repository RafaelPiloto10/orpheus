No more talk to darkness  
Forget these wide-eyed fears  
I'm here  
Nothing can harm you  
My words will warm and calm you  
Let me be your freedom  
Let daylight dry your tears  
I'm here  
With you, beside you  
To guard you and to guide you  
  
Then, say you love me every winter morning  
Turn my head with talk of summertime  
Say you need me with you now and always  
Promise me that all you say is true  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your light  
You're safe  
No one will find you  
Your fears are far behind you  
  
All I want is freedom  
A world with no more night  
And you  
Always beside me  
To hold me and to hide me  
Then say you'll share with me one love,  
One lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you,  
Here beside you  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Christine that's all I ask of you  
  
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
Share each day with me,  
Each night, each morning  
Say you love me (You know I do)  
Love me  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Love me  
That's all I ask of you
