Whoa thought it was a nightmare  
Lord it was so true  
  
They told me don't go walking slow  
The devil's on the loose  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Thought I heard a rumblin'  
Calling to my name  
  
Two hundred million guns are loaded  
Satan cries "take aim"  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke  
Let the people know my wisdom  
Fill the land with smoke  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see
