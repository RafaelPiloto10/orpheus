Woman I can hardly express,  
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness,  
After all I'm forever in your debt,  
And woman I will try to express,  
My inner feelings and my thankfulness,  
For showing me the meaning of success,  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
  
Woman I know you understand  
The little child inside the man,  
Please remember my life is in your hands,  
And woman hold me close to your heart,  
However distant don't keep us apart,  
After all it is written in the stars,  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
  
Woman please let me explain,  
I never meant to cause you sorrow and pain,  
So let me tell you again and again and again,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever
