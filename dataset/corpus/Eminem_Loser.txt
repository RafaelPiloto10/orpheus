A distant alarm, a sound from far away  
We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising, the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging, men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
"This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill..."  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm...
