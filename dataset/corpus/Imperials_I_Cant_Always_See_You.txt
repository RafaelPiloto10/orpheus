Too many times I find myself thinking  
I'm the only one who knows  
What it's like to need someone  
And how it feels to be alone  
Forgetting you're watching even if I look away  
Then you show me, I'm not really on my own  
  
Chorus:  
I can't always see you  
But I know you are there  
In the quiet ways you talk to me  
I can tell you're near  
You love me even when I'm not aware  
I can't always see you, but I know you are there  
  
So many times I know you're speaking  
And although I may not hear  
All the things you have to say  
In my heart you make it clear  
That you'll never leave me even though I turn away  
And you show me, I don't have to be afraid  
  
Chorus  
  
And I remember how your love was so real  
And how you changed my life completely  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
I can't always see you, but I know you are there
