Something's missin', when you hold me,  
You don't whisper that you're mine,  
Oh it all seems to fall into line!  
  
Every promise that you make me,  
Breaks like bubbles in the wine,  
And it all seems to fall into line!  
  
In a fog that isn't lifting,  
We are drifting apart,  
I can see someone's replaced me in your heart!  
  
There's a coolness in your kisses,  
That is only one more sign,  
How it all seems to fall into line!  
  
In a fog that isn't lifting,  
We are drifting apart,  
I can see someone's replaced me in your heart!  
  
There's a coolness in your kisses,  
That is only one more sign,  
How it all seems to fall into line!  
  
Yes it all seems to fall into line!
