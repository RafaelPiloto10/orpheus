You walked in to the room  
I just had to laugh  
The face you wore was cool  
You were a photograph  
When it's all too late  
It's all too late  
I did not have the time  
I did not have the nerve  
To ask you how you feel  
Is this what you deserve  
When it's all too late  
It's all too late  
Change  
You can change  
And something on your mind  
Became a point of view  
You lost your honesty  
I lost the life in you  
When it's all too late  
It's all too late  
We walk and talk in time  
I walk and talk in two  
Where does the end of me  
Become the start of you  
When it's all too late  
It's all too late  
What has happened to  
The friend that I once knew  
Has he gone away
