When you were here before  
Couldn't look you in the eye  
You're just like an angel  
Your skin makes me cry  
  
You float like a feather  
In a beautiful world  
And I wish I was special  
You're so fuckin' special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
  
I don't care if it hurts  
I want to have control  
I want a perfect body  
I want a perfect soul  
  
I want you to notice  
When I'm not around  
You're so fuckin' special  
I wish I was special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
  
She's running out again,  
She's running out  
She's run run run run  
  
Whatever makes you happy  
Whatever you want  
You're so fuckin' special  
I wish I was special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
I don't belong here.
