I'm really glad that you called me  
I'm unhappy you found someone new  
I've been looking myself and if I'd find someone else  
First so I'm telling is you.  
  
We're better off to have known love  
We're more than we might have been  
How many can say they went all the way  
From strangers to lovers to friends.  
  
Things could have turned out much different  
We could have been strangers again  
We were lucky to learn watched the bridge has been burned  
Only fools try to cross it again.  
  
Oh, I know that I'm going to miss you  
And although I'm hurt now and then  
I'll never regret what we went through to get  
From strangers to lovers to friends.  
  
I'm not one that sorry I loved you  
Or not do it all over again  
I remember we cried when we walked side by side  
From strangers to lovers to friends...
