Strolling along country roads with my baby  
It starts to rain, it begins to pour  
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin  
I feel a shiver run up my spine  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
After a while we run under a tree  
I turn to him and he kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
[Break]  
  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside
