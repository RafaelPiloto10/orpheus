I see in the green stream that meanders round my mind  
A girl standing with arms so warm and kind  
She reaches out, she calls my name  
But I just can't get through  
I know she's waiting in a land of sunny rain  
And I know that I'll find my girl and it's there I will remain  
I'll lay right down and there I'll stay  
'Cause there is paradise  
I've often felt her breathing as I rolled around your streets  
And so I look around me but we never chance to meet  
The golden girl with eyes of green  
A girl just meant for me  
I see in the green stream that meanders round my mind  
A girl standing with arms so warm and kind  
She's standing there, she calls my name  
But I just can't get through
