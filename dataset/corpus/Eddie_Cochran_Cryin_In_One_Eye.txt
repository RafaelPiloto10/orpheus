I am cryin' in one eye over you  
While the other searches for someone new  
If you do me wrong, I'll be gone  
'Cause my other eye would tell me to roam  
Cryin' in one eye over you  
The other feels for the one that's blue  
If you love me like you say you do  
I'll turn my other eye on you  
  
My one eye is shy, the other weepin'  
'Cause I cry for you in my sleepin'  
That's no fib as you will know  
My other eye will soon start to flow  
My love for you is very strong  
It's my fault if I'm all alone  
To love you and leave you is so wrong  
I'll be cryin' in both eyes from now on
