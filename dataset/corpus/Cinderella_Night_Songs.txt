Workin' this job ain't payin' the bills  
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills  
Kickin' down a road, not a dollar in my pocket  
Night time falls and I'm ready to rock it  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin' one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day, cause were gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Howl into the light, singin'  
Night songs  
Makes the day right  
Night songs  
Raise your glass, take a bite  
Night songs  
  
Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west  
Sleepin' all day, but never get a rest  
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right  
Livin' for the moment, time to get it tight  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin' one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Howl into the light, singin'  
Night songs  
Makes the day right  
Night songs  
Raise your glass, take a bite  
Night songs  
Oh, sing it  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin' one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day, cause were gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs
