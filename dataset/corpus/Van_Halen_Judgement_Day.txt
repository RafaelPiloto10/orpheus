It's my life, get off my ass, get outta my face  
Man, I don't see no problem  
Kickin' back, ain't kickin' you, no, no  
Anyway, if I make 'em, then I solve 'em  
Oh, that's right, yeah, whew  
Makin' plans 's a waste, ain't no future here  
Got no face, got no religion  
Oh tell me why should I care or even, why should I try?  
I just slide, slide on by, never bad enough to crucify me  
Cry! Put it out until Judgment Day  
I'll bear the cross on Judgment Day  
I do most anything, keep 'em doing anything, 'cause  
Sometimes I just want to do nothin'  
Nothin' lost, tell me, how can I lose  
When I'm startin' off with nothin'  
Oh tell me why should I care or even, why try?  
I just slide, slide on by, never bad enough to crucify me  
Oh! Put it out until Judgment Day  
I'll bear that same old cross on Judgment Day  
Oh! Hey!  
  
Hey man, anything's alright. Yeah!  
Wow! Put it out until Judgment Day  
I'll bear the cross on Judgment Day  
Put it out, put it out until Judgment Day  
I'll bear the cross on Judgment Day  
Oh! Whoa, yeah, on Judgment Day  
Oh! Whoa, yeah, on Judgment Day  
Wow!
