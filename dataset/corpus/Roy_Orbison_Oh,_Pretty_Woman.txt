Pretty woman, walking down the street  
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet  
Pretty woman  
I don't believe you, you're not the truth  
No one could look as good as you  
Mercy  
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?  
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see  
Pretty woman  
Then you look lovely as can be  
Are you lonely just like me?  
Wow  
Pretty woman, stop a while  
Pretty woman, talk a while  
Pretty woman, gave your smile to me  
Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah  
Pretty woman, look my way  
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me  
'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right  
Come with me baby, be mine tonight  
Pretty woman, don't walk on by  
Pretty woman, don't make me cry  
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey, okay  
If that's the way it must be, okay  
I guess I'll go on home, it's late  
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait  
What do I see  
Is she walking back to me  
Yeah, she's walking back to me  
Oh, oh, pretty woman
