There are worse things I could do  
Than go with a boy or two  
Even though the neighbourhood  
Thinks I'm trashy and no good  
I suppose it could be true  
But there are worse things I could do  
  
I could flirt with all the guys  
Smile at them and bat my eyes  
Press against them when we dance  
Make them think they stand a chance  
Then refuse to see it through  
That's a thing I'd never do  
  
I could stay home every night  
Wait around for mister right  
Take cold showers everyday  
And throw my life away  
On a dream that won't come true  
  
I could hurt someone like me  
Out of spite or jealousy  
I don't steal and I don't lie  
But I can feel and I can cry  
A fact I'll bet you never knew  
But to cry in front of you  
That's the worst thing I could do
