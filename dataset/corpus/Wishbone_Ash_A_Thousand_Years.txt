Times are changing, we'll soon be facing  
A story yet unknown.  
Don't deny it, we can't defy it.  
It'll happen on it's own.  
The past behind us, there to remind us  
Of what could be again.  
Fact or fiction, deep intuition  
Of wondering how and when.  
Once in a thousand years  
The secrets of the past  
Will change the way we see.  
Across the ocean, the world's emotions  
Are in and out of time.  
The changing seasons, no rhyme or reason,  
The choices, cruel or kind.  
One day it's clear, then clouds appear  
'cause nothing stays the same.  
The thoughts that have conditioned you,  
It's how you play the game.  
But then the day will come around  
We'll turn the world upside down.
