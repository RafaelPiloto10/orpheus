There's a girl on a ledge she's got nowhere to turn,  
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned,  
Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern,  
She can blame the world or prey till dawn  
  
But only love can break her fall,  
Break her fall,  
Yeah, only love can break her fall, fall.  
  
It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth,  
And she's standing outside hating everyone here,  
Yeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll,  
  
But only love can break her fall,  
Break her fall,  
Only love can break her fall. Yeah.  
  
Yeah fall, the world is her fall, break her fall,  
Love, love, love can break her fall,  
Now only love can break her fall,  
Love, love, love can break her fall, fall,  
Love, love can break her fall,  
Only love can break her.
