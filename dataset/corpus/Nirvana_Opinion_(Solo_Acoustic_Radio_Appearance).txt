Congratulations, you have won  
It's a years subscription of bad puns  
And it makes your story of concern  
And they set it up before it burns  
  
My opinions, my opinions  
My opinions, my opinions  
  
And there seems to be a problem here  
And your state of emotion seems to clear  
Now they rise and fall like Wall Street stock  
And they had an affect on our peace talk  
  
Our opinions, our opinions  
Our opinions, our opinions  
  
And congratulations, you have won  
It's a years subscription of bad puns  
And it makes your story our concern  
And you set it up before it burns  
  
[Incomprehensible] opinions, your opinions  
Your opinions, your opinions, your opinions
