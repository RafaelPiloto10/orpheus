Like a movie scene,  
In the sweetest dreams,  
I have pictured us together  
Now to feel your lips,  
On my finger tips,  
I have to say is even better  
Than I ever thought it could possibly be  
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free  
From all of my sadness,  
The tears that I've cried, I have spent all my life  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Tender words you say,  
Take my breath away,  
Love me now, and leave me never  
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace,  
I want to stay in this forever  
I think of the days when the sun used to set,  
On my empty heart,  
All alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning emotions were strong, I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Gone are the days when the sun used to set,  
On my empty heart all alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning,  
Emotions were strong  
I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight, Oh
