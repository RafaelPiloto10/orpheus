Listen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard  
Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve  
Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are  
Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock  
  
What can I do? With a bitch like you  
You know that it's true  
All I have I ask of you  
I'll be dammed  
If it's not true  
A bitch like you  
  
Get your head down in the sky  
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart  
Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are  
Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart  
  
What can I do? With a bitch like you  
You know that it's true  
All I have I ask of you  
I'll be dammed  
If it's not true  
A bitch like you
