Listen,  
If you think that we're here for the money  
You couldn't be right, you know(owowow)  
But the bread is not too good here  
It could be so natural  
I said all you got to do is listen  
  
Listen,  
If you don't hear what you can tell us  
If it's good you can tell us all  
Or you can smile, that's alright my friend  
It could be so nice, you know  
If only you would listen  
  
Listen,  
If you don't understand it, no no no no  
You got to try to fly  
And don't you put me down, please  
For creating beyond your mind  
I said all you got to do is listen
