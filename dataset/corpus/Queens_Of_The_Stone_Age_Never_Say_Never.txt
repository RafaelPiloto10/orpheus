If time itself was his demeanor  
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer  
Of sunlight landi' on the street  
Sunsuit girls must be discreet  
Sunsuit girls must be discreet  
Nursing their fathers locked inside  
They masqueraded as his bride  
  
I might like you better  
If we slept together  
But there's somethin'  
In your eyes that says  
Maybe that's never  
Never say never  
  
The slump by the courthouse  
With windburn skin  
That man could give a fuck  
About the grin on your face  
As you walk by, randy as a goat  
He's sleepin' on papers  
When he'd be warm in your coat  
  
I might like you better  
If we slept together  
But there's somethin'  
In your eyes that says  
Maybe that's never  
Never say never  
  
There's no easy way to lose your sight  
On the street, on the stairs  
Who's on your flight  
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin  
But he's got her and she's got him  
  
Never say never
