Ego music, it's all about me  
Ego music, it's all about me  
Me,me,me,me  
Yes,yes,yes,yes  
You,you,you,you  
No,no,no,no  
Ego music, it's all about me  
Me,me,me,me  
Yes,yes,yes,yes  
You,you,you,you  
No,no,no,no  
Ego music, it's all about me  
  
Ego music, it's all about  
Sense of venta climent  
Sense of venta climent  
Ego music, it's all about  
Sense of venta climent  
Sense of venta climent  
  
I see myself as a building  
My mind is the office where the world gets done  
There's a nightclub in the basement when I need some fun  
And in the penthouse later, that's where the magic happens  
  
Me,me,me,me  
Yes,yes,yes,yes  
You,you,you,you  
No,no,no,no  
Ego music, it's all about me  
  
There's a real purity to my work  
A childish innocence  
But I'm also smart and sophisticated  
I mean I grow on the street  
Sometimes I think I'm a simple folk  
Other times a scary witch diva  
What can I tell you, I'm an artist  
And of course I always had the  
Humanitarian vision  
I think everyone knows that  
My commitment is to my carrer  
And then giving something back  
  
Ego music, it's all about me  
Vacuum slogans  
And up your sentiments  
Ego music, it's all about me  
Fake humility ,  
Stand tall than tight garments  
Ego music, it's all about me  
I am my own demographic  
What does that say about me  
Ego music, it's all about me  
  
Me,me,me,me  
Yes,yes,yes,yes  
You,you,you,you  
No,no,no,no  
Ego music, it's all about me  
Me,me,me,me  
Yes,yes,yes,yes  
You,you,you,you  
No,no,no,no  
Ego music, it's all about me  
  
I think what fastinates people about me  
And I'm really grateful to my fans  
Is that I'm totally fearless  
And people really get that  
In the sea of negativity  
I'm statue of liberty  
That's why people love me  
It's humbling
