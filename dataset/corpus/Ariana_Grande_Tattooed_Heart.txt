You don't need a lot of money  
Honey, you don't have to play no games  
All I need is all your loving  
To get the blood rushing through my veins  
Huh  
I wanna say we're going steady  
Ha  
Like it's 1954,  
No,  
It doesn't have to be forever  
Just as long as I'm the name  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
You don't need to worry about making me crazy  
'Cause I'm way past that  
Eh, and so just call me, if you want me  
'Cause you got me, and I'll show you, how much I wanna be  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as I'm  
The name on your tattooed heart  
  
Wrap me in your jacket  
My baby  
And lay me in your bed  
And kiss me, underneath the moonlight  
Darling let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
