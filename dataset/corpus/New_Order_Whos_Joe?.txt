Hey Joe what you doing?  
It seems like it's all going wrong  
There's a storm in the sky passing over  
And it looks like it's going to be strong  
  
You've got eyes like an old wounded soldier  
They cry tears to be lost in the wind  
  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
What are you gonna do?  
  
I'll look for you  
And I'll get you home  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I've got to find you  
I've got to find you (Whatever I do)  
  
I'll look for you  
And I'll take you there  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I've got to find you  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)  
  
Hey Joe what you doing?  
They say you don't care anymore  
You had your heart broke by a woman  
Now it doesn't work anymore  
She said that you had it coming  
That you were no good from the start  
  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
It's time to go home  
  
I'll look for you  
And I'll get you home  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I've got to find you  
I've got to find you (Whatever I do)  
  
I'll look for you  
And I'll take you there  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I've got to find you  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)  
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
