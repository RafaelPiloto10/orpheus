Take the ribbon from my hair  
Shake it loose and let it fall  
Lay it soft against your skin  
Like the shadows on the wall  
  
Come and lay down by my side  
Till the early morning light  
All I'm takin' is your time  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care who's right or wrong  
I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
Lord, tonight I need a friend  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
I don't wanna be alone  
Help me make it through the night
