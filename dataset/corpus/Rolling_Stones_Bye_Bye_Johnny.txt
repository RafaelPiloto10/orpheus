Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust  
And put a little boy aboard a greyhound bus  
Leaving Louisiana for the golden west  
Down came her tears from her happiness  
Her own little son named Johnny B Goode  
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood  
  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode  
  
Well she remember taking money out from gathering crops  
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop  
As long as he could play it by the railroad side  
And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied  
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this  
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss  
  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode  
  
Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks  
And every time they heard the locomotive roar  
They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door  
  
Howling bye bye bye bye  
Now bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode
