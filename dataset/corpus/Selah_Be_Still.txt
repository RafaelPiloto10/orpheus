Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here  
Come bow before him now with reverence and fear  
In him no sin is found we stand on holy ground  
Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here  
  
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around  
He burns with holy fire, with splendor he is crowned  
How awesome is the sight our radiant king of light  
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around  
  
Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place  
He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister his grace  
No work too hard for Him, in faith receive from him  
Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place
