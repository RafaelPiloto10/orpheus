I don't mean to be so insolent  
But you know it's cause I love you  
The foundation of my malevolence  
You know I'd never hurt you babe  
  
Sometimes I might get edgy  
But a man can sometimes be that way  
And nobody's perfect baby  
And I'll always love you anyway  
  
Oh, Gabrielle  
The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I didn't mean to make you cry  
Oh, my sweet baby doll  
I put you above everything  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I love you til the day I die  
  
Sometimes I feel like my old man  
You know that's hard for me to say  
And sometimes I just lose my head  
Don't know why I get that way  
I want to keep you happy darling  
It could only work out that way  
Nobody's perfect baby  
And I'll always love you anyway  
  
Oh, Gabrielle  
The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I didn't mean to make you cry  
Oh, my sweet baby doll  
I put you above everything  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I love you til the day I die  
  
Gabrielle  
Gabrielle  
  
Well Gabrielle  
You know I love you baby  
Do nothing to hurt you baby  
But you know I got to love you anyway  
Oh, Gabrielle, you're so nice  
You know I, I love you baby  
Oh, my my my my my my my  
  
Oh, Gabrielle  
The sun is shinning in your eyes  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I didn't mean to make you cry  
Oh, my sweet baby doll  
I put you above everything  
Oh, Gabrielle  
I love you til the day I die  
Gabrielle
