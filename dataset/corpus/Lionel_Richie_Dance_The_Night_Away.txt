One kiss, intrigue  
You're all alone with me  
So much, delight  
I want to be with you tonight  
Champagne, caviar  
One moon under the stars  
One look, I'm sure  
I only wanted to be with you  
  
Girl I knew  
When you walked into the room  
There was nothing I could say  
You took my breath away  
So much love  
So much passion in the air  
When I looked into your eyes  
I realized  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
We'll dance the night away  
Soft lights, romance  
We talked, and then we danced  
I held you close to me  
Girl, you are my ecstasy  
Your lips, and your hair  
The way you touch me, girl I swear  
Only you could take me there  
I had to be your lover  
  
You're the one, you're the only one  
And it feels so good to me  
It's like destiny  
'Cause in my mind, in my heart and soul  
I believe the time is right  
To just let go  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
We'll dance the night away  
Girl I knew  
When you walked into the room  
There was nothing I could say  
You took my breath away  
So much love  
So much passion in the air  
Just to look into your eyes  
I realized  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
Repeat
