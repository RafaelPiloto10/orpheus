Late last night  
I get a call from a so-called friend  
He wouldn't give his name  
Says he saw you with another man  
Feels like seventeen years  
It's only seventeen days  
Since I saw the real you  
And I'll let you walk away  
  
You left me broken  
You left me stranded  
The way you play this game of love  
It's just plain underhanded  
I spent a lot of time  
And I spent all my money  
Don't want no other fool  
To put his hands on you  
  
Who you been talkin' to?  
Yeah who you been walkin' with?  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen  
  
They said I was playin' with fire  
I knew I had to take a chance  
I had to take you higher  
To a new experience  
But little did I know  
I'd never get that far  
Girl, you know you put on quite a show  
You're gonna be a star  
  
When you grow older, girl  
You'll remember I told you, girl  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen  
  
Seventeen, you're only seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen
