Chorus:  
Cuba, cuba here I come  
There's a place in the caribbean sun  
Land of future  
Land of dreams  
Checking for the coast  
  
Cuban cigars  
And the last glass in the bar  
I see the rise and the fall  
Of this down, downtown miami  
Give me someone to dance with and love  
When the sun goes down  
While Fidel is growing his hair  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
(It's Ace of base)  
Cuba, cuba libre  
Uh huh  
  
(Shock)  
  
Share in the sun  
Givin' us some taps  
That's still the one  
Where coca cola and coke  
Have arrived for consumers  
It's so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people, the nature  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
In the sun, in the south  
(It's Ace of base)  
Cuba, cuba libre  
Uhmm ah ahh  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
The world is coming over to ya,to ya  
(x4)  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
It's so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people, the nature  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
There's a place in the caribbean sun  
Cuba, cuba libre  
The world is coming over to ya  
Cuba, cuba libre  
(It's Ace of base)  
Cuba, cuba libre  
Checking for the coast
