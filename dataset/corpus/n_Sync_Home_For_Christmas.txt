Ooh...  
Crossing the ocean with my window view  
Thinkin' of the time I spent with you  
And I close my eyes and I see the family  
Thinkin' of their wish list  
All dressed up for Christmas  
On my own for too many years  
I miss the happiness, I miss the tears  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
I see the children playing in the snow  
Precious memories that I used to know  
And I see the love in the mothers' eyes  
Always there to teach us  
The real meaning of Christmas  
On my own for too many years  
I missed the happiness, I miss the tears  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
It doesn't matter  
How old you think you are  
Something happens to you  
When you see that shining star  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire, I'm sending out this wire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas  
Yeah...  
I'm coming home...
