I'm layin' awake at night  
I can't get you out of my mind  
All I can hear is my heart beat  
And a voice in the dark of some kind  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Out in the cold  
Hear me calling  
Cold  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
I know it was you I hurt  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
So much to forgive and forget  
Can't take anymore of this hurt  
On no, Oh no  
There's so many things I regret  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
Give me a chance baby  
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright  
Just for one more chance baby  
I need all your lovin' tonight  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
Why don't you rescue me  
Cold  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
Why don't you rescue me  
I'm so cold  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me
