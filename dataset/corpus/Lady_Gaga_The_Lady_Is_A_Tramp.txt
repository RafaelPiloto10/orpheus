She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight (I am starving)  
She loves the theater, but she never comes late  
I never bother, with people that I hate  
That's why this chick is a tramp  
  
She doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls  
And I definitely won't dish out dirt, with the rest of those girls (Thank-you)  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I love the free, fresh wind in my hair  
Life without care, oh I'm so broke, it's old  
I hate California, it's crowded and damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp (I am a tramp)  
  
Sometimes I go to Coney Island, oh the beach is divine  
And I love the Yankees, Jeeter's just fine  
I follow Rogers and Heart, she sings every line  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I love a prizefight, that isn't a fake (no fakes)  
I love to row boat with you and your wife on Central Park lake  
She goes to Opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)  
That's why this lady is a tramp  
  
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes  
What can I lose, 'cause I got no dough (oh no?)  
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Go!  
  
I love your free fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair  
Life without care, but I am so broke, that's oak  
Hates California it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
That's why this lady is a tramp  
That's why the lady is a tramp
