[Chorus]  
Was a sunny day  
Not a cloud was in the sky  
Not a negative word was heard  
From the people passing by  
Was a sunny day  
All the birdies in the trees  
And the radio's singing song  
All the favorite melodies  
  
He was a navy man  
Stationed in Newport news  
She was a high school queen  
With nothing left to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her name was Lorelei  
She was his only girl  
She called him Speedoo  
But his christian name  
Was Mr. Earl  
  
[Chorus]
