There's a place out on the edge of town sir  
Risin' above the factories and fields  
Now ever since I was a child I can remember  
That mansion on the hill  
In the day you can see the children playing  
On a road that leads to those gates of hardened steel  
Steel gates that completely surround sir  
That mansion on the hill  
  
At night my daddy's take me and we'd ride  
Through the streets of a town so silent and still  
Park on a back road along the highway signs sir  
Look up at the mansion on the hill  
  
In the summer all the lights would shine  
There'd be music playin' people laughin' all the time  
Me and my brother we'd lie down in the tall cornfields sir  
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill  
  
Tonight down here in Linden Town  
I watch the cars rushin' by home from the mill  
There's a beautiful full moon rising  
Above the mansion on the hill
