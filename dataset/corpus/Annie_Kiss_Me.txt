[Verse:]  
Kiss me baby (kiss me)  
Kiss me now (kiss me now)  
It is your chance  
If you want to  
I know you want it  
  
Kiss me baby (kiss me)  
Kiss me hard (kiss me now)  
If you want to  
You know I want you  
I know you want me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
I won't be here tomorrow  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
The time is running fast  
  
[Verse:]  
I look at you (I look at you)  
You look at me (you look at me)  
Let's get together  
Just for one night (for one night)  
You and me now  
  
We both look gorgeous  
We want each other (we want)  
Just for one night (just for one night)  
You and me ah... (you and me)  
  
(Kiss me baby)  
(go on)  
(kiss me now)  
(kiss me baby)  
(want me)  
  
My eyes have seen you (when you are)  
Standing, you're tall (???) (you look at me)  
Don't tell me stories  
Don't tell me lies  
Live for the night  
  
Kiss me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(chorus 2)  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (kiss me now)  
I won't be here tomorrow baby (kiss me now)  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (kiss me now)  
The time is running fast (Ah, kiss me)  
  
Kiss me now  
Just for one night (kiss me)  
Kiss me now (you and me now)  
  
Ah, kiss me  
Tonight [?]  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
Kiss me
