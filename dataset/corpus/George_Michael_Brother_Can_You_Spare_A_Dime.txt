once I built a railroad, made it run  
made it race against time  
once I built a rairoad, now it's done  
brother can you spare a dime?  
once I built a tower to the sun  
brick and rivet and lime  
once I built a tower, now it's done  
brother can you spare a dime?  
  
once in khaki suits  
gee, we looked swell  
full of that yankee Doodle De Dum  
half a million boots went slogging through hell  
I was the kid with the drum  
say don't you remember, they called me Al  
It was Al all the time  
say don't you remember, I'm your pal!  
buddy can you spare a dime?
