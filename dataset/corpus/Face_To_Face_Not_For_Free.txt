You want what you think you need  
But what you really need isn't anything  
That you want  
You think that you've got it made but  
Its what you don't know that is gonna  
Pull you down, down, down  
  
Its not for free  
No  
Its not for free  
No  
  
You want what you think you need  
But what you really need isn't anything  
That you want  
Stand back,  
Take a step aside take a look at yourself,  
Put away your stupid pride  
Its not for free  
No  
Its not for free
