I want to make money to take away my problems,  
But my problems gettin' bigger with the more money I make  
  
I want to find love that's my problem, cause the money  
Makes it hard to tell the real from fake  
  
I want to spend time with my son oh every hour  
But the money and the problems and the women keep me away  
I want to be happy for just one hour, but the only time I'm happy  
Anymore is on the stage  
I get drunk in the morning I don't look for afternoons  
I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
I been pushed and kicked around it seems my whole life  
Now I'm tired lord I'm so damm tired inside.  
  
(I think its time to get it on)  
So lets rock it with the band turn this shit up to 10 now  
I got a feeling you been waiting for way to long now  
And if your looking for a party you came to the right spot  
So drink it 'em down motherfuckers and roll with the Kid Rock  
And the band plays  
  
And I thank you people for feeling me I'm feeling you too  
Oh what a ride, its been up and down all around the world we've been  
We're back your here lets make the most of our time now  
And if you get up get up I won't let you down  
  
And when the powder hits the brain, you'll be feelin' it real son  
I'm talking guitars, car sex and real cheap wine  
All time and type you let me here it if you want more  
Lemmie here it if you want more  
I gota fifth good music if you hold out I'll pour more  
  
And I thank you people for feelin' me I am feelin' you too  
Oh what a ride its been up and down all around the world we've been  
We're back your here lets make the most of our time  
Now and if you get up get up I won't let you down  
Get up Get up Yeah  
  
Yeah what a ride and I thank you people thank you
