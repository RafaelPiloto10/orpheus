If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy,  
We could, we could you and I.  
  
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay,  
We could, we could you and I.  
  
When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there  
And just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere.  
  
If anyone could pray each night and thank the Lord that all is right,  
We could darling, we could you and I.  
  
If anyone could find the joy...
