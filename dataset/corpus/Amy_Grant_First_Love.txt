You are my first love sweet and gentle as the night  
Just being near  
You now is like a lullaby  
All that I have I'd give away to follow You  
I can't imagine having life without you  
Oh. When all these worldly battles seem to never cease  
You simply lift me up and rest me in Your peace  
I heard some people say you're only in my mind  
I hope that someday You choose to find them.  
All other loves will slowly fade like dying flame  
Tomorrow, now, and yesterday  
You're still the same I wait with longing heart to see You come again  
Your sweet and tender love will never end.
