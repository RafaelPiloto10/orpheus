Sweet little Moonshine Sally I got your picture on my wall  
You live in Tukalo Valley beside the fire waterfall  
And ev'ry night I hear you call from beneath the waterfall  
Hey hey hey  
I wanna take you don't wanna make you  
Live with me in Tukalo Valley  
Hey hey hey  
Hear me calling magic's falling  
AII around Moonshine Sally  
Moonshine Sally from Tukalo Valley  
They talk of voices in the valley they say the evil moon is high  
They say they hear no more of Sal ly where the magic waterfall runs dry  
So ev'ry night I hear you call from the magic waterfall  
Hey hey hey  
I wanna take you don't wanna make you  
. . .
