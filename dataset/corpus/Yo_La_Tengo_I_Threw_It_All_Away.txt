I once held her in my arms  
She said she would always stay  
But I was cruel and treated her like a fool  
I threw it all away  
  
One side's mountains in the palm of my hand  
Rivers that ran through everyday  
Now I must've been mad or I never knew what I had  
I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
And it makes the world go round  
Love and only love it can't be denied  
No matter what you think about it  
You won't be able to live without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So if you find someone  
Who gives you all of their love  
Take it to your heart  
Don't let it stray  
Because one thing is for certain  
You'll surely be hurting  
If you thow it all away  
Just don't throw it all away
