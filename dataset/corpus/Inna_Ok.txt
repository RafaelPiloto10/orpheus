I used to scream around  
When I was angry  
I'm asking baby why  
The hell you left me lonely?  
  
I used to fall in love  
And I'm not sorry  
I know one day you will be back to me  
Don't worry  
  
When your life gets a little dangerous  
Don't forget that you are one of us  
Dream enough to see the sunlight  
Ohh, then you rise up to the sky  
  
You say I wanna be ok, hey!  
Don't wanna be away, babe  
Away from my heart  
I want you back

Away from my heart  
  
I'm in love now shake it to the beat now  
Shake it to the beat now,
