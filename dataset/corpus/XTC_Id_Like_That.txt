I'd like That if we could cycle down some lane  
I'd like that if we could ride into the rain  
No macs, getting wet  
I'd be your Albert if you'd be Victoria, hah hah  
We'd laugh because each drop would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower  
  
I'd like that  
  
I'd like that (What would you like?) if we could lay before my fire  
I'd like that (What would you like?) if you could slide me from this wire  
Toasting fork, I'll be done  
I wouldn't hector if you'd be Helen of Troy, oh boy  
We'd laugh because each flame would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower  
  
I'd Like that  
  
I'd smile so much my face would crack in two  
And you could fix it with your kissing glue  
I'd like that  
Yes, I'd like that  
  
I'd like that (what would you like?) if we could float away in bed  
I'd like that (what would you like?) if I could row your heart and head  
With you laid on one arm  
I'd be your Nelson if you'd be my Hamilton, what fun  
We'd laugh because each stroke would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower (repeats)  
  
Say a sunflower I became  
I'd be growing in your lane
