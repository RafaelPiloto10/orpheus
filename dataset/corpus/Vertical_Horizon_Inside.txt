We're all lost  
We're all found  
We're all the same  
Just one heart beats in us  
With different names  
Just one heart  
With different names  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
Take this hand  
Lift me up  
Into your sky  
Hold me here  
It's just you and me  
'Cause you make me fly  
You make me fly  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
We're all lost  
We're all found  
We're all the same  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you (inside you)  
Hold me hold me hold me  
Inside you inside you  
'Cause I (hold me) want to be (hold me) (hold me)  
Inside you inside you  
  
Oh inside you  
Oh inside you
