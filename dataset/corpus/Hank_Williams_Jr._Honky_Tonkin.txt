When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go  
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', honey baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
When you and your baby have a fallin' out  
Just call me up sweet mama and we'll go steppin' out  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', honey baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
We're goin' to the city, to the city fair  
If you go to the city then you will find me there  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', honey baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go  
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', honey baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.
