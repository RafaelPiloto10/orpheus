High, higher than the sun  
You shoot me from a gun  
I need you to elevate me here,  
At the corner of your lips  
As the orbit of your hips  
Eclipse, you elevate my soul  
  
I've lost all self-control  
Been living like a mole  
Now going down, excavation  
I and I in the sky  
You make me feel like I can fly  
So high, elevation  
  
A star lit up like a cigar  
Strung out like a guitar  
Maybe you could educate my mind  
Explain all these controls  
I can't sing but I've got soul  
The goal is elevation  
  
A mole, living in a hole  
Digging up my soul  
Going down, excavation  
I and I in the sky  
You make me feel like I can fly  
So high, elevation  
  
Love, lift me up out of these blues  
Won't you tell me something true  
I believe in you  
  
A mole, living in a hole  
Digging up my soul  
Going down, excavation  
I and I in the sky  
You make me feel like I can fly  
So high, elevation  
Elevation  
Elevation  
Elevation  
Elevation  
Elevation  
Elevation
