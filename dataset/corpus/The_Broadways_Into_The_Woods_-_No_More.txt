Baker  
No more questions,  
Please.  
No more tests.  
Comes the day you say, "What for?"  
Please- no more.  
  
Mysterious man  
They disappoint,  
They disappear,  
They die but they don't...  
  
Baker  
What?  
  
Mysterious man  
They disappoint  
In turn, I fear.  
Forgive, though, they won't...  
  
Baker  
No more riddles.  
No more jests.  
No more curses you can't undo,  
Left by fathers you never knew.  
No more quests.  
  
No more feelings.  
Time to shut the door.  
Just- no more.  
  
Mysterious man  
Running away- let's do it,  
Free from the ties that bind.  
No more despair  
Or burdens to bear  
Out there in the yonder.  
  
Running away- go to it.  
Where did you have in mind?  
Have to take care:  
Unless there's a "where,"  
You'll only be wandering blind.  
Just more questions.  
Different kind.  
  
Where are we to go?  
Where are we ever to go?  
  
Running away- we'll do it.  
Why sit around, resigned?  
Trouble is, son,  
The farther you run,  
The more you'll feel undefined  
For what you have left undone  
And more, what you've left behind.  
  
We disappoint,  
We leave a mess,  
We die but we don't...  
  
Baker  
We disappoint  
In turn, I guess.  
Forget, though, we won't...  
  
Both  
Like father, like son.  
  
Baker  
No more giants  
Waging war.  
Can't we just pursue out lives  
With out children and our wives?  
'Till that happy day arrives,  
How do you ignore  
All the witches,  
All the curses,  
All the wolves, all the lies,  
The false hopes, the goodbyes,  
The reverses,  
All the wondering what even worse is  
Still in store?  
  
All the children...  
All the giants...  
  
No more.
