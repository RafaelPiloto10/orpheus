[Intro: kung fu sample from "8 Diagram Pole Fighter"]  
Today I'll talk about kindness  
Justice, faith and kindness  
I want you to listen carefully  
Kindness and faith, are the foundation  
Without them, we can't become good people  
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life  
And how can I be a good man then, eh?  
Well, first of all, you have to practice honesty  
Uhmm...  
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself  
Keep control...  
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything  
  
[Chorus: The Persuasions "Gypsy Woman" sample]  
Out of nowhere, there came a caravan  
This was around a campfire light  
A lovely woman in motion  
Her hair was as dark as the night  
  
[Method Man]  
Cruising on the interstate, just follow while I innovate  
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate  
Front and get ya dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait  
I'm trying to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake  
Spitting like a calico, kush from a Cali hoe  
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali, yo  
RZA you know how we go, on them 20's, that's how we roll  
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though  
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro  
My, my dames pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though  
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow  
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible  
I left my chick for cheating on me, now that bitch is miserable  
Popping bottles, painting hella Wallo's on my physical  
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle  
  
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl  
Fuck a coma, now the state you laying is a vegetable  
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable  
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Interlude: kung fu sample (RZA)]  
Only God, has lept into avenged mind  
And can, distinguish good, from evil  
Hahaha (Aiyo Cappa)  
  
[Cappadonna]  
We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out  
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house  
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real  
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attacking the field  
All in Chicago, grinding, putting it down  
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playing around  
Yo, you heard me on The Bassment, giving it to 'em  
Fake dudes hiding they self, but I could see through 'em  
Diggler, what? I'm trying to live and raise kids  
While you throwing up ya sign, I'm laying 'em down, kid  
Plus, I'm back home now, doing my thing  
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring  
  
[Chorus 2X]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
A good friend, holds his drink  
Bad company makes bad wine!  
Drinking among friends  
Red wine means a good life  
A few drinks bring comfort  
Two drinks are enough  
Money can't buy courage  
Riches mean nothing to us  
Brilliant, a display of genius
