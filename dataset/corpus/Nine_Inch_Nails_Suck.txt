There is no god up in the sky tonight  
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight  
All that was true is left behind  
Once I could see now I am blind  
Don't want your dreams you try to sell  
This disease I give to myself  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
She makes it sweeter than the sun  
I get too tight I come undone  
I bow my head to confess  
The temple walls are made of flesh  
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track  
Itches my skin right off of my back  
I'll heal your wounds  
I'll set you free  
I'm Jesus Christ on Ecstasy  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
Suck  
Suck  
Suck  
Suck  
A thousand lips a thousand tongues  
A thousand throats a thousand lungs  
A thousand ways to make it true  
I want to do terrible things to you
