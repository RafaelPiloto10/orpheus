I'd just finished writing "Jubilee Street"  
I laid down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep  
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford  
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low  
Because in my dream the girl was very young  
  
I said, "Hey little girl, where do you hide?  
You draw lightning from the sky"  
  
All of this and her dark hair  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
Last night your shadow scampered up the wall, it flied  
It leaped like a black spider between your legs, and cried  
My children  
My children  
They are lost to us  
  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down
