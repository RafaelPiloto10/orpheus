I'm alive and I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can float up here  
so soft and tingling  
You can't catch me  
I'm floating away  
  
I woke up  
And went down next door  
I'm getting up with nothing on my mind  
I went down the stairs  
With a pain in my head  
I should have never got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that mattered [Repeat: x 2]  
Aha  
  
I'm alive I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can fall down there  
Right into you your mind  
Don't put it around  
You can't catch me  
And carried away  
  
I woke up I, woke up every day  
There's nothing, nothing to say  
Half way down the stairs  
I feel a pain in my chest  
I should never have got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that it mattered [Repeat: x 2]  
Aha  
  
I'm alive, I'm can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
Half way down the stairs  
I get a pain in my chest  
I should never got out of bed  
  
I should never ever ever  
I should never...
