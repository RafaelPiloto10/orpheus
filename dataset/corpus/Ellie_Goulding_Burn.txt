We, we don't have to worry bout nothing  
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something  
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space  
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race  
  
When the lights started out, they don't know what they heard  
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world  
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky  
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire  
  
And we gonna let it burn burn burn burn  
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn  
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn

We don't wanna leave, no, we just gonna be right now  
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor  
Acting crazy getting loco to the lights out  
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe, and we turn it up  
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no secret now, no secret now  
  
When the lights started out, they don't know what they heard  
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
