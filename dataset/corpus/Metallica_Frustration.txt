Frustration  
In my lexicon of hate  
I see you with your portraiture  
Does he love you?  
Does he love you too?  
  
The brush strokes  
Kiss your breasts and toes  
I cry icicles in my stein  
The heartbeats flutter  
With an abnormal rhythm  
  
The pain shoots through my body  
A sword between my thighs  
I wish that I could kill you  
But I too love your eyes  
  
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate  
The hatred smolders in your eyes  
I'd drop to my knees in a second  
To salivate in your thighs  
  
But all I do is fall over  
I don't have the strength I once had  
In you and your prickless lover  
And his easel in his eyes  
  
I feel the pain creep up my leg  
Blood runs from my nose  
I puke my guts out at your feet  
You're more man than I  
To be dead to have no feeling  
To be dry and spermless like a girl  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
Marry me  
I want you as my wife  
  
Spermless like a girl  
More man than I  
More man than I  
  
Frustration  
In my lexicon of hate  
You're feeling less like a whore but you  
Stimulate  
  
All I do is fall over  
I don't have the strength I once had  
All I do is fall over  
I don't have the strength I once had  
  
I want you so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want you as a wife  
  
Frustration is my lexicon of hate  
Frustration is my lexicon of hate  
Fru fru frustration, my lexicon of hate  
  
I cry icicles  
Heartbeats flutter  
Abnormal rhythm  
I wish that I could kill you  
But I too love your eyes  
I want you as my wife  
I want you as my wife  
Spermless like a girl  
  
Lucky in feeling  
More man than I  
Marry me, marry me, marry me  
I want you as a wife  
Spermless like a girl  
Puking my guts at your feet  
More man than I  
Fru fru fru frustration
