I really can't stay, baby, it's cold outside  
I've got to go away, oh darlin' it's cold outside  
This evening has been, just hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice, I'll hold your hands they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor, listen to that fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry, oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors will think, baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink, there's no cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say no, sir, mind if I move in a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
Oh, what's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out, ah, but it's cold outside  
  
What are you doing with your coat  
You don't need your coat  
Why are you putting your coat on for  
It's warm out here, you don't understand  
  
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside  
Oh, the answer is no, oh darlin', it's cold outside  
This welcome has been, lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm, look out that window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious, please but your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, oh but your lips look delicious  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
They was never such a blizzard before  
  
Ooh, I got to go home, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your coat, it's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand, I trill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my lifelong sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay, get over that old out  
Ah, but it's cold outside, ah, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby, it's cold outside, baby, it's cold outside  
It's cold outside, it's cold, baby, it's cold outside  
You know that it's, you know that it's cold outside  
Ah, it's cold outside  
  
Darlin' as a friend, sure James  
As a friend you, you must stay and, and warm up by this fire little bit  
Let me get you, let me get you a hot toddy or something  
Well, I really can't my mother will worry about me  
  
People are so suspicious, it's just an innocent suggesting  
You stay warm and keep yourself healthy that's all  
It's nippy out there, it's cold  
Oh, you know that drink does look kinda nice  
It is a perfectly nice drink  
  
Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold, it's warm  
Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold outside
