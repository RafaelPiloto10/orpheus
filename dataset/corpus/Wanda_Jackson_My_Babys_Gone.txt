Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still  
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the night and realize you're gone  
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come  
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone  
But it cries the world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone
