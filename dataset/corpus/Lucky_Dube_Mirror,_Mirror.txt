Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy  
Man with the words of wisdom  
They found his long black coat  
On the banks of the river  
'Cause he never came back  
In it's pocket they found notes  
He'd written some time ago  
About his so called friends  
It read, love all your friends  
But never trust any one of them  
Which got me thinking about  
My very own friends  
Mirror, mirror, on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy  
Man with the words of wisdom  
See them coming  
Hear them talk  
Never believe a word they say  
He told me one day  
Even behind the smile  
That he wore on his wrinkled face  
Everyday, you could see the scars  
Of hurt from the past  
Which got me thinking of  
My very own, so called friend  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
...
