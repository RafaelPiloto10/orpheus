I don't wanna fight no more  
Only wanna get to shore  
Baby, don't slam the door tonight  
We ran another off the tracks  
That's time we can't get back  
But, we can save tomorrow if we try  
  
Oh, 'til we make this right  
Oh, I won't say, "Good night."  
  
I just wanna make you laugh  
I just wanna see that smile  
Babe, we're only here, oh, for a little while  
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep  
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace  
  
Everybody needs a place  
Somewhere that's warm and safe  
A shelter from this crazy world we're in,  
But tonight I let the rain inside  
And took away your place to hide  
I'm sorry that I made you cry again  
  
Oh, we can make this right,  
Oh, kiss me good night  
  
I just wanna make you laugh  
I just wanna see that smile  
Babe, we're only here, oh, for a little while  
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep  
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace  
  
Yeah, I want peace  
  
Oh, we don't have to fight  
Oh, just kiss me all night  
  
'Cause I want peace, yeah  
  
I just wanna make you laugh  
I just wanna see that smile  
Babe, we're only here, oh, for a little while  
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep  
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace  
  
I just wanna make you laugh  
I just wanna see that smile  
Babe, we're only here, oh, for a little while  
I just wanna hold you till you fall asleep  
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace,  
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace
