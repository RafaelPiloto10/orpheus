I like my lovin' country style  
I'm only in the city for a while  
So when I'm rid you see how I'll head for Tennessee  
'Cause I like my lovin' country style  
I like my lovin', huggin', kissin' country style  
It's the best by test wins by country mile  
You don't know what you've missed  
Just wait till you've been kissed  
Kissed in that good old country style  
I like my huggin' country style  
There's only kind of boys that's worthwhile  
They're best for everything even plowin' in the spring  
That's why I'm like 'em country style  
I like my lovin', huggin', kissin' country style  
It's the best by test wins by country mile  
You don't know what you've missed  
Just wait till you've been kissed  
Kissed in that good old country style  
I like my kissin' country style  
And a country weds is the lady's style  
I want a country boy to be my pride and joy  
'Cause I like 'em good old country style  
I like my lovin', huggin', kissin' country style  
It's the best by test wins by country mile  
You don't know what you've missed  
Just wait till you've been kissed  
Kissed in that good old country style
