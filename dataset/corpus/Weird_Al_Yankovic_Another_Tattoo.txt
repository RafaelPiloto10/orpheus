Beautiful tats  
All over my back  
Makes me so proud  
I'm gonna shout it out loud  
I got another tattoo baby  
Yeah another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo)  
(Noth noth nother tattoo)  
  
No part of me is blank I'm really ink obsessed  
It's like an art show the moment that I get undressed  
At every job interview they're just so impressed  
'Cause I got all my ex-wives' names on my chest  
Over here is Clay Aiken, there's a side of bacon  
And I'm in a torpedo fighting with Satan  
Next to hello kitty and a zombie ice skating and wait  
It's Ronald Reagan  
  
I got these dragons, I got these dolphins  
All inscribed on me indelibly  
I've had bad reactions, bad infections  
Even Hepatitis C  
My friends think that I need therapy  
Maybe some laser surgery  
For the flaming goat skull on my knee  
Knee (knee) knee (knee) knee, hey  
  
Beautiful tats (yeah) all over my back (all over)  
And I've got some space here on the side of my face here  
For another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
Another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
  
No I'm not high (high)  
I'm really OK (OK)  
I just love these scribbles (ha ha) that won't go away  
I got another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
Another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
  
Yeah  
Yes there were a few  
I got from a losing a bet  
I misspelled a word or two  
Still there's nothing I regret  
My shopping trips are no sweat  
There's never stuff I forget  
Check out this rad Boba Fett  
He's playing clarinet  
  
Beautiful tats (yeah) all over my back (all over)  
And what the heck (ha ha)  
There's still room on my neck  
I'll get another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
Another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
  
I don't know why (why)  
But every day (day)  
Whenever folks see me  
They just back away  
I got another tattoo  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
Another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo babe no-nother tattoo)  
Yeah  
  
D'ow  
Deh, OK right there by my elbow, you see?  
Yeah I got a couple of square inches left  
Maybe a squid or a tarantula or something  
I dunno surprise me  
D'ow
