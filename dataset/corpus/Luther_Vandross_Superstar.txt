I wanna tell you, baby  
The changes I've been goin' through  
Missin' you, missin' you, oh oh  
Till you come back to me  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
N-n-n-no, n-n-no  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby  
I love you  
Yeah, I really do  
  
Long ago  
And oh, so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show  
  
And your guitar  
And you sound so sweet and clear  
But you're not really here  
It's just the radio  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yeah  
I love you  
I really do  
  
(To belong) Yeah, hey, eah, yeah, hey, hey  
(To belong) Whoa, ho, oh, whoa, ho, ho,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You looked for me to be yours  
You want my love, but you're on the road  
Don't you remember me anymore  
  
Loneliness  
Is such a sad affair  
A sad affair  
And I can hardly wait  
To be with you again  
  
And what to say, to say  
To make you come again  
Oh, honey  
Come on back to me again, yeah, hey  
I wanna be, I wanna be anywhere you are  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, woo, baby, oh, baby  
Yes, I love you  
I really do  
  
Yeah, hey,  
Yeah, yeah, eah, yeah, ooh,  
Play it easy, play it easy  
Keep it right there, keep it right there, keep it right there  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
What are you gonna say  
It's alright, it's alright  
Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright  
Alright now  
Keep it right there, keep it right there

But now it's alright, it's alright  
Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright  
Alright now

Are you holdin' someone else real tight  
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
