I just kissed you goodbye  
A half an hour ago  
I know you've driven to the airport  
But I just gotta pick up the phone  
And hear you one more time  
Saying my name  
I must be going outta my mind  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
Baby  
  
Cause I miss you babe  
  
I've never loved anyone like I love you  
So when you're not around  
I must confess I lose myself  
And I don't know who where I am  
I might be crazy  
Crazy about being your man  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
When I finally see you  
I know it'd be like never left alone  
But there's no cantillation  
Tonight isn't waiting  
Praying maybe you'll come  
Coming coming babe  
  
Tell me now  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time just cross along  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
I look at my watch  
Stare at the clock  
And they don't move  
I don't need a round  
I'm just froze on the couch  
Oh the seconds feel like hours  
An hour's like a day  
It's a twilight zone in this home  
When you go away  
  
Please don't go away
