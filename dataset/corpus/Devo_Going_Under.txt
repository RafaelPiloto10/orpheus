Left home with a friend of mine  
Gone two years and I don't know why  
Now I'm happy all the time  
I can't think and I'm feelin' fine  
Girl put me in a situation  
  
Going through soft core mutation  
Think you heard this all before  
Now you're gonna hear some more  
I know a place where dreams get crushed  
Hopes are smashed but that ain't much  
Voluntary experimentation  
Going through soft core mutation  
I'm going under  
  
Down under where the lights are low  
To a place where all the mutants go  
Doing things I never did before  
Inside out and coming back for more  
Little girls with the four red lips  
Never knew it could be like this  
You put me in a situation  
Goin' through soft core mutation
