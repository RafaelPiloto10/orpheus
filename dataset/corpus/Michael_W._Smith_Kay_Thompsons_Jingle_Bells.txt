Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer, on Vixen  
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen  
Put on your bells, your Christmas bells  
  
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride  
Christmas time is here again  
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride  
To spread good cheer again  
From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall  
Dash away, dash away, dash away all  
  
Old Saint Nicholas, he took a flight  
The moon was shining bright  
Bring out the bells  
Ol' Saint Nick was riding through the sky  
You should have seen those reindeer fly  
  
Bring out the bells, it's a holiday season  
Bring out the bells, it's a happy time  
Bring out the bells, we've got a good reason  
To ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime
