I don't want to hear a love song  
I got on this airplane just to fly  
And i know there's life below  
But all that it can show me  
Is the prairie and the sky  
  
And i don't want to hear a sad story  
Full of heartbreak and desire  
The last time i felt like this  
It was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire  
And i stood on the mountain in the night and i watched it burn  
I watched it burn, i watched it burn.  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham  
I would hold my life in his saving grace.  
I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham  
If i thought i could see, i could see your face.  
  
Well you really got me this time  
And the hardest part is knowing i'll survive.  
I have come to listen for the sound  
Of the trucks as they move down  
Out on ninety five  
And pretend that it's the ocean  
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean  
Baby do you know what i mean  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham  
I would hold my life in his saving grace.  
I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham  
If i thought i could see, i could see your face.
