The preacher talked with me and he smiled  
Said, Come and walk with me  
Come and walk one more mile  
Now for once in your life you're alone  
But you ain't got a dime  
There's no time for the phone  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I told him I'm in no hurry  
But if I broke her heart  
Then won't you tell her I'm sorry  
And for once in my life I'm alone  
And I've gotta let her know  
Just in time before I go  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
Well I laughed but that didn't work  
And it's only her love  
That keeps me wearing this dirt  
Now I'm crying but deep down inside  
Well I did it to him  
Now it's my turn to die  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on
