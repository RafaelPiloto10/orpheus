Wake up  
My love  
Never thought you'd make me, break me  
Now I'm up from below  
Such a brilliant star you are  
And will your love keep burning baby  
Burn a hole right through my eyes  
All these short times feel like no time  
I thought you ought to know  
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty  
I'm so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on?  
  
Do, Do you, Do you know?  
Do you know how long I've waited?  
To look up from below,  
Just to find someone like you?  
And will your love like burn me, baby?  
Burn a hole right through my heart  
I think I might just trust you, maybe  
But I'm not sure  
I'm not sure I want to know  
  
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty  
I'm so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on?  
  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa  
I think you could make me girl  
Could make me take my life  
I know you can break me girl  
Take all of me  
All of me, yeah hey  
  
Wake up  
My love  
Never thought you'd make me, break me  
Now I'm up from below  
Such a brilliant star you are
