You were meant for me and there ain't no two ways about it  
Even on my darkest days oh they couldn't make me doubt it  
Someday things are gonna be the way they were before  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I don't worry darling you'll be back  
Honey I'm not bragging I'm just statin' facts  
The ocean always brings each piece of driftwood back to shore  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
  
I know they have you now sweetheart they don't know what they got  
Heaven is still heaven when the weather ain't so hot  
When all is done that will be done you'll knock upon my door  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I don't worry...  
Unless somebody wants my body before
