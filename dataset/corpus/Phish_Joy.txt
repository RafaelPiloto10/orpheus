Joy is over there in her incredible clothes  
She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes  
I was doing the best that I can I suppose  
But that little girl dancer  
Eventually grows  
Well she grows  
  
You can't imagine all the times that I tried  
To uncover the source of the tears that you cried  
Let's throw it away and just go for a ride  
And you'd say OK but you'd keep it inside  
And I tried  
I tried  
I tried  
I tried  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
I never thought I could have it so good  
You were the song that my soul understood  
That time is a river that flows through the woods  
And it lead us to places we both understood  
Would be gone  
Before to long  
Would be gone  
Before to long  
  
When we were young we thought life was a game  
But then somebody leaves you and your never the same  
All of the places and people belong to the puzzle  
But one of the pieces is gone  
And it's you  
It's you  
It's you  
Joy, it's you  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
Anytime we'll weather this storm  
Inside together you'll see the change  
When the sun shines through  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too
