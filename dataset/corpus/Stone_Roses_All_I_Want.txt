I'll show you the way  
I could make it seem sound so easy  
I'm lazy  
There's so much to be seen  
It isn't just a dream  
And all I need is all I want  
So don't turn away  
  
Help you get away  
Tell you not just always  
I'm lazy  
There's so much that I can see  
It isn't it isn't just a dream  
  
And all I need is all I want  
So don't turn away  
All I need is all I want  
Don't turn me away  
  
And all I need is all I want  
No no don't turn away  
All I need is all I want  
Don't don't shy away  
  
And all I need is all I want  
No no don't turn away  
All I need is all I want  
You can turn me away  
Do you see even me  
No no don't turn away  
Turn away
