I've thrown it all away that I might gain a life in You  
I've found all else is loss compared to the joys of knowing You  
Your beauty and Your majesty are far beyond compare  
You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer  
[Chorus:]  
Take the world, but give me Jesus  
You're the treasure in this life  
Take the world, but give me Jesus  
Is my cry  
Now I've seen You as the Savior, I will leave the rest behind  
Take the world, but give me Jesus is my cry  
Into the world I go that I might live this life of love  
I won't be overcome, for You are in me and You are strong  
For time and for eternity, I know I'm in Your care  
You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer
