What I had to flaunt  
Has come back to haunt  
Like a restless wind  
And the best of times  
That were left behind  
They come blowing in  
  
No one's pushing me through that door  
But it might as well be a forty-four in the night  
  
It's too late to say goodbye  
I'm all out of lies  
It's too late to say goodbye  
  
How can I resist  
One more stranger's kiss  
Should the thrill be gone  
And if I must refrain  
Will I wind up the same  
As the jealous dogs?  
  
From this day forward could be too long  
But crossing that border would be so wrong, and you're right  
  
It's too late to say goodbye  
I've run out of lies  
It's too late to say goodbye  
  
I know that you're right  
It's too late to say goodbye  
I'm all out of lies  
It's too late to say goodbye  
This feeling won't die  
It's too late to say goodbye  
I can't watch you cry  
It's too late to say goodbye
