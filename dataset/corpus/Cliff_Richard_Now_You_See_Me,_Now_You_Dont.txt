You say you'd really like to know me  
Why don't we meet and you will show me  
Here's the note you hope I'll read it  
Take your number if I need it  
Someone said it's hard to find out  
What it is I think about  
I'm good at smiles and easy phrases  
Don't look too close I don't like gazes  
Now you see me, now you don't  
Understand me then you won't  
I'm in vision I'm on stage  
I'm 17 I don't look my age  
I share a word you know I mean it  
You give a smile you know I've seen it  
Across the rooms our eyes keep meeting  
Music is my special greeting  
Another night, another town  
It's all so quick, it spins me round  
Now you see me, now you don't  
Understand me then you won't  
I'm in vision I'm on stage  
I'm 17 I don't look my age
