[Chorus:]  
Dough is what I got, lil mama  
Dough is what I got, pretty lady  
Dough is what I got, shortie  
Dough is what I got, baby  
C'mon, I'm paid [x4]  
  
[Lil Wayne:]  
Give a woman none, uh-huh  
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn  
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn  
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm  
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term  
Well we get it how we live never live and learn  
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned  
Only down south rapper could've been in tha firm  
Or the commissioner of Wu-Tang nigga  
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga  
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma  
Nigga get over here like Scorpion  
And when it comes down to this recording  
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan  
No, I want ringsfor my performance  
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist  
Same coach, same game, been starting  
...Same triangle offense  
I come through the lane like dargent  
Refree niggaz is lame they call charging  
I have no brain I'm retarded  
We are not the same I'ma Martian  
You can be my Jane i'm your Tarzan  
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison  
I am magnificent like Marcus  
You might wanna fall back like August  
Or late september whatever you call it  
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage  
I am talking to no particular audience  
But understand I'm the guardian  
And understand there won't be no guardin him  
You will just get played like an accordion  
I don't give a damn if she's bossy  
I keep pussy running like a faucet  
She better catch like she Steve Largent  
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"  
  
[Lil Wayne:]  
See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you here sometimes  
But um um since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
Show me what you bout, lil daddy  
I know you need to stop, stop hatin  
I know what you not, wodie  
And that is Weezy Baby  
Blunts up now  
Blaze [x4]  
  
[Lil Wayne:]  
Tell the world take six  
Young dictionary make words make sense
