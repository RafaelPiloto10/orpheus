I've got a funny kind of guy  
Nobody knows him  
Any better than I  
  
Says without me  
He can get along  
But I know that's just a man's way  
Of saying he's strong  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
Oh, I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
If I do something to please him  
He never gives me credit  
If I think he'll bring me candy and roses  
Huh, I might as well forget it  
  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes his privacy  
And when a mood hits him  
I know when to let him be  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny, funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
Sometimes when he hurts me so bad  
I think I've got migraine in the head  
All he has to do is touch me  
Tears disappear  
I'll forgive him in a minute  
  
I have to pretend  
There ain't much I know  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes to run the show  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
Though sometimes he brings me little tears  
  
Still love the man he is  
Oh, I love that man  
I wouldn't change his funny ways  
And I wouldn't change the man he is
