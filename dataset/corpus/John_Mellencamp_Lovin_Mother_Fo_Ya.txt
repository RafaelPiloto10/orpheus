Riding in the park with your golden tan  
You got your new tattoo, half devil, half man  
Straddlin' a stallion made of chrome and steel  
Spittin' out fire, this cat's for real  
  
He'll be a lovin' mother for ya, don't you know  
He'll be a lovin' mother for ya, don't you know  
  
Everybody's got their attitudes  
Some are nice and some are rude  
They come up and slap your back  
They say, "Hey buddy, you can't do that."  
Everybody's got their opinions to protect  
But after midnight they'll be sucking your neck  
  
They'll be a sucking mother for ya, don't you know  
They'll be a sucking mother for ya, don't you know  
  
Squeeze me girl don't let me fall  
I want to walk, don't want to crawl  
Let me put my kickin' mule into your stall  
'Cause I'm a kickin' mother for ya, don't you know  
'Cause I'm a kickin' mother for ya, don't you know
