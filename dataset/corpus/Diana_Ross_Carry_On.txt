Carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on  
Never sleep, new day dawns  
  
There's a new breeze blowin' tonight  
Clear away the past, honey, free at last  
Yes, I've paid for the choices I've made  
No apologies from me  
  
You know I'll never, no  
Never lose my will  
Never  
Never standin' still  
  
I'll carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
I carry on, I carry on  
  
I stand alone in the eye of the storm  
Pressures all around, tryin' to wear me down  
But it's all right, I won't give up the fight  
I said, "Lord, lift me up, let me rise above"  
  
I'll never  
Nobody's gonna take my pride  
I won't stop  
I will not be denied  
  
Carry on  
When the valley is deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
I carry on, carry on  
  
I won't let, I won't let nothing hold me  
(I won't let, I won't let, no no I won't let)  
(Won't let nothing hold me back)  
I won't stop now, no  
(I won't let, I won't let, no no I won't let)  
(Won't let nothing hold me back)  
Carry on  
  
I'll carry on  
(Yes, I'll carry, carry on)  
Carry on  
(Yes, I'll carry, carry on)  
Carry on  
(Yes, I'll carry, carry on)  
  
I'll never  
Nobody's gonna take my pride  
I won't stop  
I will not be denied  
  
Carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With the mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
  
When the valley's deep, just carry on  
When the mountain's too high, you gotta carry on  
With the mighty love, mighty love  
New day dawns  
  
When the valley's deep, just carry on  
When the mountain's too high, just carry on  
With the mighty love  
It's a new day dawn, carry on  
It's a new day dawn, carry on
