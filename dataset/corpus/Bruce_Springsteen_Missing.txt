Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air  
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there  
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night  
Everything was in place, everything was all right  
But you were missing  
Missing...  
  
Last night I dreamed the sky went black  
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back  
You were lost and in trouble so far from home  
I reached for you, my arms went to stone  
I woke and you were missing  
Missing...  
  
I searched for something to explain  
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves  
Tell me baby where did you go  
You were here just a moment ago  
  
There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall  
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall  
Your smell drifts through our bedroom  
I wake, but I don't move
