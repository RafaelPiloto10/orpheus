I ain't got a heart of stone  
I'm hurtin' more now than I've ever known  
If you mean the things you said  
I'm gonna wind up out a my head  
Can't sleep alone at night  
I just can't seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you  
  
I don't want to tie you down  
Don't need a reason to have you around  
But each time you walk away  
Don't be surprised if I ask you to stay  
Can't sleep alone at night  
I just can't seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
And I'm damned if I don't but I love you  
I said I'm damned if I do  
And I'm damned if I don't cause I love you  
  
I ain't got a heart of stone  
You haven't left me a mind of my own  
But it's got such a hold on me  
I don't think I could ever be free  
How can I survive  
I'm fighting to keep myself alive  
I'm damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you  
Can't seem to see the light  
I've done everything but I can't get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you
