Well in this world of sorrow, trouble and temptation  
Jesus always promised trial and tribulation  
Then He said, "You don't have to fret or fear  
Children, be of good cheer and keep walkin' on"  
Children, keep walkin' on, keep walkin' on  
Keep walkin' on, keep walkin' on  
  
In Jesus Christ the truth is found  
He'll keep our feet on solid ground  
Sometimes we have to just believe  
What He put in the Book for us to read  
Satan you can't fool this girl  
My Lord overcame this world  
And I'm walkin' on, yeah I'm walkin' on  
Lord, I'm walkin' on, yeah I'm walkin' on  
  
Well Jesus walked on the water, Peter walked on it too  
God gave you the power to do what you cannot do  
Every road we travel He's traveled down before  
There ain't no need to worry where it leads to anymore  
I'm walkin' on, I'm walkin' on, I'm walkin' on  
I'm walkin' on, I'm walkin' on, I'm walkin' on  
  
Well the road is narrow and it's straight  
But it leads right up to the Golden Gate  
It may be rough it may be long  
But I don't have to walk alone  
Step by step and day by day  
He takes my hand and I hear Him say  
Keep walkin' on, gotta keep walkin' on  
Oh, keep walkin' on, oh keep walkin' on  
  
What you gonna do, can't pay the rent  
Yeah what you gonna do when the money's spent  
What you gonna do when you just can't cope  
Hey, what you gonna do when you're outta hope  
Oh, keep walkin' on, oh keep walkin' on?
