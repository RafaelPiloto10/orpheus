There you go and baby here am I  
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry  
Golly gee what have you done to me  
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore  
  
Do you remember baby last September  
How you held me tight each and every night  
Oh baby how you drove me crazy  
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore  
  
There's no use in me a-crying  
I've done everything now I'm sick of trying  
I've thrown away my nights  
Wasted all my days over you  
  
Now you go your way baby and I'll go mine  
Now and forever till the end of time  
I'll find somebody new and baby  
We'll say we're through  
And you won't matter anymore  
  
There's no use in me a-crying  
I've done everything now I'm sick of trying  
I've thrown away my nights  
Wasted all my days over you  
  
Now you go your way baby and I'll go mine  
Now and forever till the end of time  
And I'll find somebody new and baby  
We'll say we're through  
And you won't matter anymore  
No you won't matter anymore  
You won't matter anymore
