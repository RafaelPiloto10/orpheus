Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'  
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor  
All the way in town they can hear me comin'  
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more  
And i smell my motor burnin'  
Underneath the hood is smoke  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
  
The highway patrol got his eyes on me  
I know what he's thinkin' and it ain't good  
I'm movin' so fast he can barely see me  
Gonna lose that man, i know i should  
I gotta kick in my pedal  
Make my ford move a little bit faster  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway
