Whose hair styles are out of this world  
Whether it's straight or bouffant or it's curled  
  
My baby my baby my baby  
Hey hey hey  
My baby, baby pretty baby  
  
Hair soft like a baby lamb and I love to run my fingers through it.  
I hope she digs me the way I am,  
But if I have to change.  
You know I'm gonna do it for my baby,  
(i'm gonna do it for my baby)  
  
Personality containing more gold,  
Then any bank in this world could hold.  
My baby, my baby, my baby, hey hey  
My baby, baby, pretty baby  
  
Enough gold in her personality, to set fort knox to shame.  
This golden girl has proved to me,  
Yet no guy could try  
To stake his claim on my baby.  
(stake his claim on my baby)  
(my baby)  
  
She's cute as can be (my baby)  
This girl's got a hold on me (my baby)  
Has a kiss so sweet, she knocks me off my feet,  
She makes my life complete  
Oh yeah, she's my baby  
Oh yeah, she's my baby  
  
And I love her so  
Yeah, I love my baby so  
My baby, she's cute as can be, my baby,  
This girl's got a hold on me my baby,  
Has a kiss so sweet, she knocks me off my feet,  
She makes my life complete  
  
Who has my mind in a kind of haze,  
Who has me walkin' around in a daze.  
  
My baby, my baby, my baby, hey hey hey  
My baby, baby, pretty baby  
  
Gives me a feelin' I can't explain,  
She sets my soul on fire.  
But I don't feel hurt and I don't feel pain.  
All I feel is strong desire for my baby (strong desire for my baby)  
I love her so  
  
I love my baby so  
Oh yeah my baby, that personality to satisfy me  
Woo that's my baby, my baby, my baby
