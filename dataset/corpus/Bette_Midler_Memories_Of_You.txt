Why can't I forget like I should?  
Heaven knows I would if I could.  
But I just can't keep you off my mind.  
  
Though you're gone, I have to explain,  
All around me you still remain.  
Wonder why fate should be so unkind?  
  
Waking skies at sunrise,  
Every sunset, too,  
Seems to be bringing me  
Memories of you.  
  
Here and there, everywhere,  
Scenes that we once knew.  
And they all just recall  
Memories of you.  
  
How I wish I could forget  
Those happy yesteryears  
That have left  
A rosary of tears.  
  
Your face beams in my dreams  
Spite of all I do.  
Everything seems to bring  
Memories of you.  
Those memories of you.
