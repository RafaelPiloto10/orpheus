Lost in the dark the lovers embrace  
As the last song plays, everyone makes for home  
Now it's just me and you alone  
  
And I won't really care if we can't meet again  
You just live your life I'm just a night to pass  
You're just a dream that couldn't last  
  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
I want you, I want you - want me too ?  
  
No way of knowing just where my life's going  
Who cares if it's wrong or it's right  
When all I believe in is just how I'm feeling tonight  
  
Oh, take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
I want you, I want you  
  
To fade
