AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER VOICE: "And now for our feature presentation"  
I guess I was in this situation and it wasn't right,  
A bad combination and the wrong type,  
I completely lost my cool locked in this state of mind.  
I played a wicked game, mmm,  
I couldn't seperate the pleasure from the pain,  
Giving everything but getting no gain,  
I sat down and realised that something had to change (had to change)....  
Then you came like a new groove over me,  
You make me feel like finally....  
I'm not the question, i'm the answer,  
Not the disco, i'm the dancer!  
No more cold, you got me hot!  
And I, I, I, I, I.....  
I'm not the rhythm, i'm the music,  
Got the beat, not gonna lose it!  
It feels so good, i'm on the up (i'm on the up),  
I, I, I, I, I.......  
Ah, ah, ah!!  
Hot now, we could up the record and get down,  
I've seen my own reflection and I know now how it feels to shimmy on a
different sound.  
Cos you came like a new groove over me,  
You make me feel like finally....  
I'm not the question, i'm the answer,  
Not the disco, i'm the dancer!  
No more cold, you got me hot!  
And I, I, I, I, I.....  
I'm not the rhythm, i'm the music,  
Got the beat, not gonna lose it!  
It feels so good, i'm on the up (i'm on the up),  
I, I, I, I, I.......
