Well completely sweet that's my baby  
Completely sweet, I don't mean maybe  
Well completely sweet that's my baby  
Completely sweet, I don't mean maybe  
And I love her more 'n' more each day  
She's so completely sweet  
  
Well a-just like a-honey, that the bees bring in  
Mmm, a-just like a honey, that the bees bring in  
Mmm, I get my sugar, when I kiss her on the chin  
  
Well the sugar in my coffee, well the sugar in my tea  
Well the sugar in my coffee, mmm the sugar in my tea  
Mmm, they both taste better, with a sugar on my knee
