I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light  
Flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life.  
I used to chase the moment of desire  
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.  
  
[Chorus:]  
It was just a, nothing but a grand illusion.  
Heart was quicker than the eye.  
Nothing but a grand illusion,  
Legend in my own mind.  
  
I held you in my arms till the other side of midnight.  
Kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights.  
Standing on the threshold of desire,  
Caught between the madness and the fire.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was all a grand illusion.  
Hand was quicker than the eye.  
Nothing but a grand illusion,  
Legends in our own minds.  
  
I used to chase the moments of desire  
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.  
  
It was just a, nothing but a, it was all a grand illusion.  
Nothing but a grand illusion.  
It was all a grand illusion,  
Legend in my own mind.  
  
It was just a grand illusion.  
Nothing but a grand illusion.  
It was just a grand illusion,  
Legend in our own mind.
