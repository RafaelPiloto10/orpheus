I listen to the Trumpet of Jesus  
While the world hears a different sound  
I march to the drumbeat of God Almighty  
While the others just wander around  
I'm a member of the Holy Ghost traveling band  
We're moving on up to a better land  
I hear the voice of the Supernatural singing  
Like only those who know Him can  
  
(Verse 1:)  
One sweet sound makes  
A whole world of difference  
When the world seems indifferent to you  
His Melody of love calls you to be great  
When marking time was all you thought you could do  
So if you've been playing all your days by ear  
Never knowing what your song was to be  
Then pull up a chair, let down your hair  
And take a few lessons from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Verse 2:)  
A spiritual fanfare has a sound all it's own  
At the birth of a lasting song  
It's been two thousand years since Jesus was born  
And still the celebration goes on  
If you feel the need to get your life in tune  
'Cause you're tired of the derdge every day  
Then turn yourself around,  
Put your feet on the ground  
And just hear what I have to say  
  
[Chorus:]
