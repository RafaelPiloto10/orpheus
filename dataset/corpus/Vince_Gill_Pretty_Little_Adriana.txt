You sure have a pretty smile  
It sure has been a while  
Since I've felt your touch  
You've got the sweetest way  
I think about you every day  
I miss you so much  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
Are you lonesome tonight  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
I'll find you when it all feels right  
  
You're so soft and innocent  
The sweetest night I ever spent  
Was being held in your embrace  
You're such a gentle soul  
It's killing me to know  
When will I see your face
