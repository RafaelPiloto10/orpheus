Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home  
I take a walk so I can curse my ass for being dumb  
I make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone  
Stop at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog  
I've been goin' to Lukin's...I gotta spot that Lukin's...  
I knocked the door at Lukin's...opened the fridge...  
Now I know life is worth...  
I find the key but I return to find an open door  
So fucking freezin', they jump out the car, everybody wants some  
I find my wife, I call the cops, this day's work's never done  
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun
