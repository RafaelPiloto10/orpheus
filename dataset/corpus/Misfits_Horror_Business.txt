Too much horror business  
Driving late at night  
Psycho '78  
My bathroom is new  
  
You, you don't go in the bathroom with me  
Psycho '78  
12 o'clock, don't be late  
All this horror business  
My mirrors are black  
  
You don't go in the bathroom with me  
With you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
  
Too much horror business  
Drivin' late at night  
Psycho '78  
My bathroom is new for you  
  
You, you don't go in the bathroom with me  
Psycho '78  
I'm talking about  
12 o'clock, don't be late  
I say, all this horror business  
My mirrors are black for you  
  
You, you don't go in the bathroom with me  
With you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
I'll put a knife right in you  
I'm warning you  
You, nobody can do  
What I can do, no
