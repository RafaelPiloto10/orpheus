wishing you were with me now  
Praying for the times we shared together  
Of which I thought they'd last forever  
To somehow re-appear  
wondering what it would be like  
If you would be there when morning's broken  
Too many things were left unspoken  
Oh why can't you be here  
Chorus.  
It I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think about our love that never dies  
wishing you were with me now  
Wondering why the laughing and the crying  
The making fun, and never lying  
Just had to disappear  
thinking what it would be like  
To re-live the love and care you gave me  
To thank you for those limes you saved me  
Oh why can't you be here  
Chorus:  
If I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think about our love that never dies  
all I have in life  
I would gladly give away  
If it meant for one day  
You'd be there  
Chorus.  
If I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think of you, still hurts inside  
if you could only hear me now  
If I could get these words to you somehow  
For a moment I would make you realise  
I'm still so proud to share with you  
This love that never dies  
I want so much to let you know  
Our love will never die
