You lost faith in the human spirit  
You walk around like a ghost  
Your star-spangled heart  
Took a train for the coast  
  
When you shine you're a hilltop mansion  
So how'd you lose the light?  
Was it blown by the wind,  
In the still of the night?  
  
We're up against the wall  
  
Up against the wall  
There's something dying on the street  
When they knock you down  
You're gonna get back on your feet  
(No you can't stop now)  
  
I always saw you as a kind of keeper  
A mother to a child  
But your boys have grown soft  
And your girls have gone wild  
  
From the blue ranch to the black hills  
To the redwood sky  
The season may pass  
But the dream doesn't die  
  
Why did you drop the ball?  
  
Up against the wall  
There's something dying on the street  
When they knock you down  
You're gonna get back on your feet  
(No you can't stop now)  
  
When they break your heart  
When they cause your soul to mourn  
Remember what I said  
Boy you was battle born  
  
(No, you can't stop now)  
You was battle born  
  
When the night falls on the land  
Are you haunted by the sound?  
It's gonna take more than a hand  
To turn this thing around  
  
Won't you lean it on me?  
Rescue, set me free  
  
Up against the wall (Up against the wall)  
There's something dying on the street  
When they knock you down (Up against the wall)  
You're gonna get back on your feet  
Cause you can't stop now (Cause you can't stop now)  
  
Did they break your heart? (Did they break your heart?)  
And did they cause your soul to mourn  
Remember what I said  
Boy you was battle born  
Cause you can't stop now (Cause you can't stop now)  
  
Come on show your face  
Come on give us one more spark  
So we'll start a fire  
Unless we fall into the dark  
And you can't stop now (No, you can't stop now)  
  
You never know  
If you never learn  
You never shine  
If you never burn  
The rising tide  
The undertow  
The venom and  
The overflow  
You turn away  
Welcome home
