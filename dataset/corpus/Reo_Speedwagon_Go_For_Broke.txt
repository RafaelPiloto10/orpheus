My life is runnin like a stock car race  
High speed and lots of curves  
Keep the pedal to the metal, win or lose  
But don't lose your nerve  
Some people live in fear  
If you can call that living  
I'm gonna keep my ass in gear  
And take the chance I'm given  
  
I'm gonna go for broke, play to win  
Do or die, just don't give in  
Take a shot, roll the dice  
Don't look back, just go for broke  
  
My love is spinning like a steering wheel  
Just grab it and hold on tight  
Feel the power in your hands  
Take me right to the edge tonight  
Some people love in vain  
If you can call that lovin  
So let's hit the streets again  
It's all or nothin  
  
Standing on the razor's edge  
But I'm not going under  
Every night I'm on the line  
Livin like my days are numbered
