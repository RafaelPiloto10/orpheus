Don't wanna hear the news  
What's going on  
What's coming through  
I don't wanna know  
Don't wanna know  
Just wanna hide away  
Make my escape  
I want the world  
To leave me alone  
Feels like I feel too much  
I've seen too much  
For a little while  
I want to forget  
  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb  
  
Can't find no space to breathe  
World's closing in  
Right on me now  
Well that's how it feels  
That's how it feels  
Too much light  
There's too much sound  
Wanna turn it off  
Wanna shut it out  
I need some relief  
Think that like I think too much  
I've seen too much  
There is just too much  
Thought in my head  
  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be  
  
Taken away from all the madness  
Need to escape  
Escape from the pain  
I'm out on the edge  
About to lose my mind  
For a little while  
For a little while  
I wanna be numb  
  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb
