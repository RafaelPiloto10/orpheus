Watching your bright blue eyes  
In the freeze frame  
I've seen them so many times  
I feel like I must be your best friend  
You're looking fine, so fine, oh my  
Dressed up like a lovely day, oh  
  
Babyface, babyface  
Slow down child, let me untie your lace  
Babyface, babyface  
Cover girl with natural grace  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy  
  
Coming home late at night  
To turn you on  
Checking out every frame  
I've got slow motion on my side  
Turning around and around  
With the sound and color  
  
Under my control, go  
Round and around, going down  
Dressed up like a lovely day  
  
Babyface, babyface  
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace  
Babyface, babyface  
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy  
  
Do do do do do do do do do...do do...  
Do do do do do do do do do...do do...  
  
Babyface, babyface  
Slow down child, let me untie your lace  
Babyface, babyface  
Open the door, let me unpack my case  
Babyface, babyface  
You're everywhere child  
You're all over the place  
Babyface, babyface  
You're coming to me from outer-space  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy
