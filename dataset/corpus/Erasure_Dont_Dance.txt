Anything you want  
Everything you need  
Every time you take  
What's on offer  
  
You can step on out  
You can do without  
You don't have to be  
Like every other  
  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
Do something 'bout it  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
You can do without it  
  
Always stay in line  
Fool you every time  
Wonder why it ends up in sorrow  
You don't have to go  
  
All you say is no  
There's no rhythm that you have to follow  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
Do something 'bout it  
  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
You can do without it  
Everywhere you go  
Everything you do  
  
Got to make the best  
Just that bit better  
You can step on out  
You can do without  
  
You don't have to be  
Like every other  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
Do something 'bout it  
  
Don't dance to the rhythm  
You can do without it
