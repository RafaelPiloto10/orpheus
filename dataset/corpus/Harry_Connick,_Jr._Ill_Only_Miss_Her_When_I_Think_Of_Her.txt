I'll only miss her when I think of her  
And I'll think of her all the time  
Likely I'll spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase  
Things I found hard to praise, right now, would seem sublime  
  
And the truth is  
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs  
'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
  
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears  
I'll bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years  
The truth is  
  
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs  
'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears  
  
I'll bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years.
