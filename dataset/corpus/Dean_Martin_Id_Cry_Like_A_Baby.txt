I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye,  
I'd feel like a snowball on the fourth of July,  
If you ever said you were leaving for good,  
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would.  
  
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon,  
I'd let out a wail that would be heard on the moon,  
Our love was so splendid, don't end it so soon  
Don't leave me here sighing, a-sobbing and a-sighing,  
Crying like a baby for you.
