As long as she needs me  
I know where I must be  
I'll cling on steadfastly  
As long as she needs me  
As long as life is long  
I'll love her right or wrong  
And somehow I'll be strong  
As long as she needs me  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know  
When someone needs you  
You love them so  
  
I won't betray her trust  
Though people say I must  
I've got to stay true, just  
As long as she needs me  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know  
When someone needs you  
You love them so  
  
I won't betray her trust  
Though people say that I must  
I've got to stay true, just  
As long as she needs me
