[Dolly speaking]:  
Put your hand on her waist and stand  
With her right in your left hand  
And one and one two three, ah! One two three,  
Oh, no, this one... And one two three  
One two three  
  
[Cornelius speaking]:  
Look I'm dancing!  
Well, I was.  
  
[Dolly speaking]:  
Of course you were, Mr. Hackl!  
[singing]  
Take the someone whose arms you're in  
Hold onto her tight and spin  
And one two three, one two three, one two three  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Look, I'm dancing!  
  
[Dolly:]  
Come here.  
Turn around and turn around, try floating through the air  
Can't you be a little more aesthetic?  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?  
  
[Dolly:]  
The word I think I'd use is athletic!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Well my heart is about to burst  
My head is about to pop  
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop!  
  
[Dolly:]  
That's wonderful, Mr. Hackl!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
... Look, everybody! I, Cornelius Hackl... Sport  
... I'm dancing!  
  
[Dolly:]  
You're next, Mr. Tucker!  
Glide and step and then step and glide  
  
[Barnaby:]  
And everyone stand aside!  
  
[Dolly:]  
Oh, not yet Mr. Tucker! One, two, three...  
One, two, three, ah!  
  
Cornelius  
Look, he's dancing!  
Dolly  
I think he's phenomenal!  
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so  
Or the tango filled with passion seething  
  
[Barnaby:]  
I might join the chorus of the castle garden show  
  
[Dolly:]  
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker, kee-keep breathing  
  
[All three:]  
For my heart is about to burst  
My head is about to pop  
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop!  
  
[All:]  
Make the music weave a spell  
Whirl away your worry  
Things look almost twice as well  
When you're slightly blurry  
As around and around you go  
Your spirits will hit the top  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop  
One-two-three  
One-two-three  
One-two  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop!
