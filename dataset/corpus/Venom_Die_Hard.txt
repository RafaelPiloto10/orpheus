Satan, Father  
Help me from this grave  
  
Demons, Warriors  
Ever be my slaves  
'Cause I can't reason  
With men and mortal fools  
They will die hard,  
  
Hear the golden rule  
  
  
Die Hard  
Legions iron and steel  
Die Hard  
Men of war reveiled  
Die Hard  
Captors of the Brave  
Die Hard  
  
Die Hard  
  
  
Sinner, liar  
Guard your crown of thorns  
Priestess, Parson  
Live your life of scorn  
Of Hell and blasphemy  
I can RAISE the fires  
  
We can grow strong  
Satanic royalty  
  
  
Evil, angels  
Ride the wings of Hades  
Vultures of the night  
  
Death is on our side  
Furnace burnin' bright  
'Cause we ain't getting tired
