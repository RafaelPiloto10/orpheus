Polly wants a cracker  
I think I should get off her first  
I think she wants some water  
To put out the blow torch  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly wants a cracker  
Maybe she would like some food  
She asks me to untie her  
A chase would be nice for a few  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
  
Polly said  
  
Polly says her back hurts  
And she's just as bored as me  
She caught me off my guard  
It amazes me, the will of instinct  
  
It isn't me  
We have some seed  
Let me clip  
Your dirty wings  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself  
I've got some rope  
You have been told  
I promise you  
I have been true  
Let me take a ride  
Don't cut yourself  
I want some help  
To please myself
