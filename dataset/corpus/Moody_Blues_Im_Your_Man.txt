Here I go again  
Finding it so hard to explain  
The way I feel when I hold you near  
Still it hurts when you cry  
Maybe you think love has passed you by  
Don't you know I need you so  
But I guess you need to know  
  
I'm just a man, that's all I am  
I'm just a man, that's yours  
I'm yours you know I'm yours  
  
Life keeps changing key  
I'll look to you please look back at me  
See I'm changing every day  
Reaching out for happy days  
  
But I'm just a man that's all I am  
I'm just a man I'm yours  
I'm simply yours  
  
Life keeps changing key  
I'll look to you please turn and look at me  
You'll see I'm changing every day  
In my search for happy days  
  
But then I'm just a man  
That's all I am  
I'm just a man I'm yours  
That's yours, simply yours  
  
See me as I am, for I'm just a man  
I'm just a man but I'm yours  
Oh I'm yours I'm simply yours
