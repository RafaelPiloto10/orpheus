Got to grab a pen and a paper  
Got to write a tiny note to you,  
I can't get you out of my system  
There's something very difficult 'bout you  
  
Hook:  
It's possible,  
When I get that feeling  
It's so revealing  
It's possible,  
When you're givin' that look  
I just wanna oh-oh-oh!  
  
People tell me all the wrong things  
People tell me I don't have a clue  
There's something in the air, I just know it!  
Like patches on the skin it stick like glue.  
  
Hook:  
I''s possible,  
When I get that feeling  
It so revealing  
It's possible,  
When you're givin' that look  
I just wanna oh-oh-oh!  
  
[Break]  
  
The sound of your heartbeat, promise so much (x2)  
  
Du du do do do do  
Got to write a tiny note to you  
Du do do do do do  
There's something very difficult about you!  
  
Hook:  
It's possible,  
When I get that feeling  
It's so revealing  
It's possible, when givin me that look  
I just wanna oh-oh-oh!  
  
When I get that feeling it's so revealing  
It's possible,  
When you're givin' that look  
I just wanna oh-oh-oh! (x3)
