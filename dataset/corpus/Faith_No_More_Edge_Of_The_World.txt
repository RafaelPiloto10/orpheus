Come here, my love  
I'll tell you a secret  
Come closer, now  
I want you to believe it  
I'll tell you all the things  
You want to hear  
Don't worry, baby  
There's nothing to fear  
Hey, little girl  
Would you like some candy?  
Look into my eyes  
I've seen it all  
Hand in hand  
Together we fall  
We'll sing and dance  
And we'll find romance  
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world  
Come sit right down  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
It's not the point  
That I'm forty years older  
You can trust me  
I'm no criminal  
But I'd kill my mother  
To be with you  
We'll sing and dance  
And we'll find romance  
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world  
Give me a smile  
Let me see those pearlies  
I'll do anything  
For the little girlies
