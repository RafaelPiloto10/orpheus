Just keep a movin' wherever you were movin'  
They told me you were movin' on  
Just keep a goin' wherever you were goin'  
The day you left me here all alone  
You were in such a hurry such a tizzy such a flurry  
To leave me for the new love you found  
  
So just keep scratchin' gravel hit the road and start to travel  
I don't want to do time I'm not hangin' round  
Oh just keep a goin' wherever you were goin'  
The day ya broke my heart and said so long  
Just keep a movin' wherever you were movin'  
The day you told me you were movin' on  
  
Just keep a movin' wherever you were movin'  
The day you moved right out of my door  
Just keep a love for you and keep him under cover  
Your secret love's no secret anymore  
  
When you gave me the go sign I didn't even know why  
You were actin' mighty high and mighty then  
Now your new love's grown colder than a well digger's shoulder  
And you wanted me to take you back again  
  
Oh just keep a goin' wherever you were goin'  
The day ya broke my heart and said so long  
Just keep a movin' wherever you were movin'  
The day you told me you were movin' on
