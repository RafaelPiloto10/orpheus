Completely want to give my love  
Completely  
I'd rather be alone than be in love half the way  
I want to find someone that I can trust completely  
want to give my heart completely  
To someone who'll completely give their heart to only me  
And when I find that one  
That's when I'll fall in love  
  
Completely  
Not half but whole  
With heart and soul  
Completely not in between  
But everything  
Completely  
That's the way it's got to be  
The way I want someone to fall in love with me  
  
Forever want to feel the word  
Forever  
And know there'll be somebody forever by my side  
And when that feeling comes  
That's when I'll give my love  
  
Completely  
Not half but whole  
With heart and soul  
Completely not in between  
But everything  
Completely  
That's the way it's got to be  
The way I want someone to fall in love with me  
  
It's all or nothing for this heart of mine  
And I won't give up this heart till the day I find  
Somebody who can be  
Someone who loves me  
  
Completely  
Not half but whole  
With heart and soul  
Completely not in between  
But everything  
Completely  
That's the way it's got to be  
The way I want someone to fall in love with me  
  
Completely...
