I choose to be his confidant  
And to keep him from the fire  
I choose to be quietly discreet  
But that is his desire  
I touch with gossamer wings  
To be quiet around you  
There is so much going on  
You could easily  
Wake up with a stranger  
  
It's not something that you plan  
One night in a world of pain  
You finally understand  
Not all the king's horses  
Not all the king's men  
Could put it back together  
  
You said you wouldn't do this for very long  
It is so defining  
Well it bounces off the wall  
And you  
When the miracle is happening  
High priestess  
She's the keeper of the peace  
And there's Twice as much... intensify  
What people will do  
To get... this... high...  
  
It's not something that you plan  
One night in a world of pain  
You finally understand  
Not all the king's horses  
Not all the king's men  
Could put it back together  
  
And now alone in my room  
As it all begins again  
Was I so wrong  
Why am I always so intense  
In this same place I sit  
The same place as before  
I came all the way here  
Just to watch you walk out that door  
  
I didn't ask when you shook your head  
I always accepted what you said as the truth  
And the truth only  
Well, it's not enough that you depend on me  
It's not enough that you say you love me  
It's not enough to just save face  
  
Because sometimes you just fall from grace  
Sometimes you just fall from grace  
  
Maybe I am calmer now  
Maybe things are fine  
Maybe I made the whole thing up  
Maybe it isn't a lie  
Maybe the reason I say these things  
Is to bring you back alive  
Maybe I've fought this long and this hard  
Just to make sure you survive  
Just to make sure you survive
