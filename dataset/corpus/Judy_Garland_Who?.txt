[Chorus]  
Who, stole my heart away  
Who, makes me dream all day  
Dreams I know can never come true  
Seems as though I'll ever be blue  
Who, means my happiness  
Who, would I answer yes to  
No one, but you!  
  
A woman's intentions, her famine inventions  
A seldom if ever defined  
And I am no different, why should I be different?  
I simply can't make up my mind  
How can I solve this situation  
Except by the process of elimination  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can it be, can it be, who can it be?  
You'll never guess who has stolen my heart away Dreamin' dreams I know  
Can never come true  
  
Seems as though  
I'll never be blue!  
Oh who, means my happiness  
Who, would I answer yes to  
Well you oughta guess who, who...  
No one but you!
