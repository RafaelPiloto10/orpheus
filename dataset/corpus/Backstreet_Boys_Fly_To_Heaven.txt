This song is not a Backstreet song,  
althought Howie sings it with his sister.  
I think it's important to say that  
  
  
Yesterday is now a memory  
Just a picture on the wall  
Of a life I once shared with you  
Someone who listened when I called  
(Bridge)  
So many things I should have said to you  
I had the chance and let it slip away  
If I could fly to heaven (if I could fly up)  
Just to see you one more time (just to see you one more time)  
I'd fly all the way to heaven (to heaven)  
Just to say that I love you  
The last three words you said to me  
I love you  
Remain an echo in my mind (remain an echo in my mind)  
Never imagined that you'd leave so soon  
I will miss you sweet Caroline  
(Bridge)  
(Chorus)  
If I could fly to heaven (vuelvo a cielo)  
Just to see you one more time (quiero verte otra vez)  
I'd fly all the way to heaven (directo al cielo)  
Just to say that I love you  
(Angel de la guardia) Now I lay me down to sleep  
(Dulce compania) I pray my heart and soul I'll keep  
(No me desampares) And if I should die before I wake  
(Ni de noche, ni de dia) In your arms my soul you'll take  
(Chorus)  
Te Amo  
(Chorus 2 x's)  
  
  
(This song is in the album of Pollyanna. written by Howie D and Pollyanna
