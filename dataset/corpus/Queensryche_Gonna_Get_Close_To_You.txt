I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall  
I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall  
Outside your balcony I have a room with a view  
And I'm watching you  
  
I dial your telephone each and every afternoon  
I wait by your door till you're asleep at night  
And when you're alone I know when you  
Turn out the light  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm gonna get close  
  
You fumble for your keys  
I'm six or seven steps behind you  
I'm so close to you  
Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you  
How did I find out?  
You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic  
Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it  
It's as plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh so close  
  
If you knew my infinite charm  
There'd be no reason to be so alarmed  
Maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right  
Maybe I'm some kind of lunatic  
You say I'm wasting all of my time  
But I know what to do with it  
It is plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm like a hungry Criminal  
and your protection is minimal  
So minimal
