Some people think they jive me  
But I know they must be crazy  
They can't see their misfortune  
Or else they're just too lazy  
Je suie le grand zombie  
With my yellow chaffen of choisen  
Ain't afraid of no tomcat  
And gonna fill my guts with poison  
I walk through the fire  
And I'll fly through the smoke  
I want to see my enemies  
On the end of my rope  
Walk on pins and neeedles  
And I see what they can do  
Walk on guilded splinters  
With the King of the Zulu  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Come to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
  
When I roll out in my coffin  
Drink poison in my chalice  
Pride begins to fade  
And you all feel my malice  
I put gris-gris on your doorstep  
So soon you be in the gutter  
I'll make your heart melt like butter  
I say I can make you stutter  
  
[Chorus x3]
