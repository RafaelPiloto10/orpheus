I know now, how much I love you  
I knew it surely  
When I saw my blood  
I cried with my wet eyes  
I said I love you  
I said I love you dying in the mud  
It's funny you know  
I'm not the one that feels bad  
Some guy is gonna knock  
At our front door  
Honey he's gonna try  
And tell you in a nice way  
That Mrs., your not Mrs. anymore  
  
Just one more time  
I wish that I could see you  
Just one more time  
I wish that you were near  
Just one more time  
I wish that you could hear me  
But bitterness won't make me reappear  
  
I love you, my God, how I love you  
I see you all around me  
It's time now  
It's time to say good night  
But this time, my love  
I won't have to get up and fight  
I love you
