I never know why  
Why we can't see eye to eye  
And like a fool I believed  
We would find a way to survive  
  
I wish we could be more than just a memory  
'cause we loved, we laughed, we cried  
And there's no good in goodbye  
  
You tell me you need some time  
Some time to be on my own  
Right now when I need you so  
Don't know how long it will take  
Do you expect me to wait  
But baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go  
  
If you must go, you ought to know  
I will get along, I will live without you  
And if you should leave I hope you see  
I won't be around baby if you shoud leave  
You're gonna need me  
  
You might think that leaving is easy  
I had no right to lead you on  
I should have told you the moment the feeling was gone  
What I'm trying to say is that I need some space,  
I need to be sure  
  
No, you'll never find another love like me  
All around this world  
Still you tell me  
  
You tell me you need some time  
Some time to be on my own  
Right now when I need you so  
Don't now how long it will take  
But baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go  
  
You said you'll always be mine  
I need to be on my own  
I gotta be on my own  
Not gotta beg you to stay  
But I'll be back boy I know  
Baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go
