Lights on, stage set  
I guess I gotta put on a show again  
Cause everyone's waiting  
Females, fly jets  
When I turn the radio on  
I hear all my songs playing, yeah  
Whatever money can buy  
I probably got it  
That's real talk, yeah  
I see my name in the sky all over the world  
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
  
Plenty of my loved ones wanna be stars  
Cause nobody said it would be so hard  
Wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me  
  
So exclusive  
I don't have to wait in the line  
It's like the club is mine now  
If it was only that simple  
Then what I'm saying is easy to do  
And we know that's not true  
Whatever money can buy  
I probably got it  
That's real talk, yeah  
I see my name in the sky all over the world  
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
Complaining to my loved ones I wanna be a star  
But no one ever told me it would be so hard  
I wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me  
  
My dream and it's my heart  
The life of being a star  
You don't even know how hard it is, do you, yeah  
Now I'm thankfully for everything  
And I'm finally becoming a man  
Now I gotta bigger a show to do  
Lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
Complaining to my loved ones I wanna be a star  
But no one ever told me it would be so hard  
I wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me
