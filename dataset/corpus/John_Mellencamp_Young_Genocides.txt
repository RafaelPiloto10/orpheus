Destiny shares the eyes of the young genocides  
Suicides that are still alive  
Their success has been so well disguised, yeah  
And on their face, is a razors blank stare  
As if to know their destiny is going no where??  
But no where is not so hard to bare  
Where their parents can decide  
Hand and hand they walk together  
With their broken pride  
Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers  
And the whole world to decide??  
Desperately searching and dangerously.....  
I deserve....  
Not much worse than they are, of the young genocides  
Facing the world with your back to the wall  
Its hard to feel important at all  
The Grand Illusion that'll never come  
Its disguised itself as tomorrow
