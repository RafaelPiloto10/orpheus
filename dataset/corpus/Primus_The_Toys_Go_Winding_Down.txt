An overaged boy of 39 has left the wing today  
The first time in his life he's made that step  
Be numbed by the society and plagued by insecurity  
He's entered in a race that must be won  
One of the animals has left its cage today  
In search of better things, so it seems to be  
But in this land of polyurethane,  
things are apt to get a bit hot  
  
As the toys go winding down  
  
C.G. The Mexican is a friend of mine  
We used to sit around the house watching Evil Dead  
Talking about the way it used to be  
Skit dat daddle dee dee  
We used to pull the strippers out of San Pablo Bay  
Now the delta waters go down So. Cal.  
And the strippers start to fade away  
  
It's pudding time!  
  
As the toys go winding down
