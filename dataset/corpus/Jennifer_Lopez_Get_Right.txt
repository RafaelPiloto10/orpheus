You lookin' just a little too hard at me  
Standin' just a little too close to me  
You sayin' 'Not quite enough' to me  
You sippin' just a little too slow for me  
No doubt you're playin' real cool homey  
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me  
Trippin' (trippin') a little more than I should be  
So let yourself go and get right with me!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm about to sign you up  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to fill your cup  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right, tonight  
We can get right  
  
Your lips talkin' about I play too much  
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?  
My hips movin' oh so slow (so slow)  
Bar tab lookin' like a car note (car note)  
All I need is you here right by my side  
Take whatever you want baby let's ride  
And whatever you want you let me decide  
Just put your name on the dotted line  
  
I'm about to sign you up  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to fill your cup  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right, tonight  
We can get right  
  
So much we got to say, but so little time  
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind (don't leave this
love behind)  
Baby take my hand I'll show you why  
  
I'm about to sign you up  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to fill your cup  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right, tonight  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to sign you up  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to fill your cup  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right, tonight  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to sign you up  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right, get right  
We can get right  
  
I'm about to fill your cup  
We can get right before the night is up  
We can get right, get right  
(right-ahh-y-ahh-iyight- right-ooo-iyight)
