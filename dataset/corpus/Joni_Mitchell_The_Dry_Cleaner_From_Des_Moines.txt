I'm down to a roll of dimes  
I'm stalking the slot that's hot  
I keep hearing bells all around me  
Jingling in the lucky jackpots  
They keep you tantalized  
They keep you reaching for your wallet  
Here in fools' paradise!  
  
I talked to a cat from Des Moines  
He said he ran a cleaning plant  
That cat was clanking with coin  
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp  
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it  
He kept ringing bells  
Nothing to it!  
  
He got three oranges  
Three lemons  
Three cherries  
Three plums  
I'm losing my taste for fruit  
Watching the dry cleaner do it  
Like Midas in a polyester suit  
It's all luck!  
It's just luck!  
You get a little lucky and you make a little money!  
  
I followed him down the strip  
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus  
Where the cowgirls fill the room  
With their big balloons  
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose!  
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears  
And lions, pink and blue there  
He couldn't lose there!  
  
Des Moines was stacking the chips  
Raking off the tables  
Ringing the bandit's bells  
This is a story that's a drag to tell  
(In some ways)  
Since I lost every dime  
I laid on the line  
But the cleaner from Des Moines  
Could put a coin  
In the door of a John  
And get twenty for one  
It's just luck!
