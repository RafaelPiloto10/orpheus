What happened to me  
Oh it seems so long ago  
The cuts run deep  
But the scars still show  
  
I live in the shadows  
Where it's been so hard to grow  
I'm still a servant in a nobleman's robes  
  
You know my weakness girl you know my kind  
You helped me see when I was blind  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
Afraid of the hurricane  
I hide in my domain  
I need release from all this pain  
Please don't forsake me  
In these ruins of your home  
I can't wait forever  
Don't leave me alone  
  
I have a secret if you want to learn  
I will surrender in return  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
You know my weakness girl you know my kind  
You helped me see when I was blind  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance
