If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
If being right means being without you  
I'd rather live a wrong doing life  
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame  
It's a downright disgrace  
Long as I got you by my side  
I don't care what your people say  
  
Your friends tell you there's no future  
In loving a married man  
If I can't see you when I want to  
I'll see you when I can  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
  
Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you  
Knowing I got a wife and two little children  
Depending on me too  
And am I wrong to hunger  
For the gentleness of your touch  
Knowing I got somebody else at home  
Who needs me just as much  
  
And are you wrong to fall in love  
With a married man  
And am I wrong trying to hold on  
To the best thing I ever had  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
  
Are you wrong to give your love  
To a married man  
And am I wrong trying to hold on  
To the best thing I ever had  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right  
  
I don't want to be right  
If it means sleeping alone at night  
I don't want to be right  
If it means coming home at night  
I don't want to, I don't want to  
I don't want to never, never, never be right
