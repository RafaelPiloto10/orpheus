Hey girl, we should take this up tomorrow uh  
'Cause I wanna lay it down you some dirty things to you  
In between the shits you and me, girl I'm a freak  
I'ma give it up, guarantee to go all night  
You're late, round and round, round my head on my shoulders  
You can tease me girl, it's all  
  
Chorus:  
All it takes is one drink, one touch, one kiss to open you up  
Girl your body turned me on right now, on right now  
But know I got the key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
I know I got the key 2 your heart, your heart  
  
Hey girl, once you sleep indeed a sexy lingerie alike, oh yeah  
I wanna play it girl, so baby show me all the games you like  
In between the sheets you and me girl I'm a freak  
I'ma give it up, guarantee to go all night  
You're late, round and round, round my head on my shoulders  
You can tease me girl, it's all  
  
Chorus:  
All it takes is one drink, one touch, one kiss to open you up  
Girl your body turned me on right now, on right now  
But know I got the key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
Key 2 your heart, your heart  
I know I got the key 2 your heart, your heart  
  
... too more bottles, baby do we know if you I'm on  
Tell em what we don't need no ice  
'Cause baby girl your car  
You make me come on to rock close  
I just wanna make you say oh  
And baby we can give right to it  
We can skip the whole play  
I can't wait to see you riding  
Now I'll be the...  
  
[Chorus:]
