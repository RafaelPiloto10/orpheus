I'm just as proud as I can be  
And everytime you're out with me  
I'm hopin' everyone will see  
'Cause I'm so proud of you  
When we go walkin' down the street  
I show you off to all we meet  
You roll your eyes and look so sweet  
I'm just so proud of you  
When we go home together after school each night  
I don't want no other, you're a doll all right  
I'm just so proud when I'm with you  
The way you wear that cute hair-do  
And when you blush, I love that too  
I'm just so proud of you
