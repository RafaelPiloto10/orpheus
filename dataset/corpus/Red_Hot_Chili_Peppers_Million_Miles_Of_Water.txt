Broke down, I found  
Even when you think you need a rest  
You will live to fight another round  
I know it's too bad, so sad  
All the things that we could've been and could've had  
  
Hey girl, what sound  
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground  
Now, I found you right here  
A million miles of water  
  
You were my muse  
Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you light the fuse  
I know that my girl, big lie  
Four years in and you never even said goodbye  
  
Hey girl, what sound  
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground  
Now, I found you right here  
A million miles of water dear  
  
Hey girl, what sound  
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without  
Now I found it right here  
I want you to remember dear  
  
We were two of a funny kind  
So damn blind but now we got to nevermind  
I know that this is the end, we tried  
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend  
  
Hey girl, what sound  
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground  
Now, I found you right here  
A million miles of water dear  
  
Hey girl, what sound  
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without  
Now I found it right here  
I want you to remember dear
