You were so blind to let me go  
You had it all but didn't know  
No one you'll ever find will be  
Closer to all your dreams than me  
Believing the grass would be greener  
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"  
But I know you'll soon discover  
You're never satisfied with any other  
  
[Chorus:]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score  
  
You'll change your mind and call my name  
Soon as you find they're all the same  
And when you find yourself alone  
Don't come back crying  
You should have known  
Believe me I'm not pretending  
It's not hard to predict  
This ending now  
'Cause I know you'll soon discover  
You're needing me in spite of all the others  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score  
  
Maybe now you just can't conceive  
That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely  
Baby, how could you ever believe  
That another could replace me  
The one and only  
But when your down  
In your time of need  
And you're thinking that you  
Might be coming back to own me  
Just think again 'cause  
I won't need your love anymore!  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
