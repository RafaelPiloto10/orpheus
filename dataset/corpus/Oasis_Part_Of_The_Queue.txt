So then be off, find that I've lost my way in the city.  
The streets and the thousands of colours all bleed into one.  
I fall down, Heaven won't help me.  
I call out, no-one would hear.  
All of a sudden I've lost my way out of the City.  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning is breaking it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town.  
  
Name on the faces in places - they mean nothing to me.  
It's all they can do to be part of a queue in this town.  
I fall down, Heaven won't help me.  
I call out, no-one will hear.  
"There'll be no tomorrow" they say, well I'll say "more's the pity."  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning has broken it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town.  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning has broken it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town.  
  
Finding my soul in this town.  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
  
Na na na na na na na na....
