I don't care if you won't  
Talk to me  
You know I'm not that kind of girl.  
And I don't care if you won't  
Walk with me  
It don't give me such a thrill.  
And I don't care about the way you look  
You should know I'm not impressed  
'cause there's just one thing  
That I'm looking for  
And he don't wear a dress.  
  
I need a man  
I need a man  
  
Baby baby baby  
Don't you shave your legs  
Don't you double comb your hair  
Don't powder puff  
Just leave it rough  
I like your fingers bare.  
When the night comes down  
I can turn it round  
I can take you anywhere.  
I don't need love  
Forget that stuff  
You know that I don't care  
  
I need a man  
I need a man  
  
I don't need a heart breaker  
Fifty-faced trouble maker  
Two timing time taker  
Dirty little money maker  
Muscle bound cheap skate  
Low down woman hater  
Triple crossing double dater  
Yella bellied alligator  
  
I don't care if you won't  
Talk to me  
You know I'm not that kind of girl.  
And I don't care if you won't  
Walk with me  
It don't give me such a thrill.  
And I don't care about the way you look  
You should know I'm not impressed  
'cause there's just one thing  
That I'm looking for  
And he don't wear a dress.
