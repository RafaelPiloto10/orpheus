I'm back to life  
From the walking dead  
No more demons in my head  
I'm sick of ugly lies  
Leave this ball and chain  
As the hatred dies, so does pain  
  
My soul is free  
I've got wind beneath my wings  
Yesterday's gone  
My heart sings  
  
Time to believe  
In the better part of me  
Tomorrow is here  
Awaiting  
  
My resurrection  
My resurrection  
  
One chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make a right  
I have never felt so alive
