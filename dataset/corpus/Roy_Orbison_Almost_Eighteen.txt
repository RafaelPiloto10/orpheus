Almost eighteen, a lot of sugar and lace  
Almost eighteen with an angel face  
She says, I'm her kind of guy and if I leave her, she'll die, uh, uh  
I'll flip upside down and all the way around  
I'm acting like a clown because I think I've found  
The cream of the crop, I know I'll never stop  
I'll go on lovin' my baby, she's a grown up lady now  
Full skirt, don't flirt, ballerina shoes  
Pin slips, two lips that never sing the blues  
Almost eighteen, a ribbon in her hair  
Almost eighteen, my baby's young and fair  
0h, oh, I'll never let her go because, oh, I love her so, oh, oh  
She's gonna have her birthday then we'll run away  
We're gonna find a preacher, let him be the teacher  
Gonna honeymoon all through the month of June  
Darlin', we'll have a time until we're ninety-nine, yeah, yeah  
Wedding bells gonna ring, we're gonna be together  
I love her, she loves me, our love'll live forever  
Almost eighteen, she's a swingin' queen  
Almost eighteen, oh, what a lovely dream  
Until the end of time, my baby's mine, all mine, uh, uh  
Almost eighteen, almost eighteen, almost eighteen, almost eighteen
