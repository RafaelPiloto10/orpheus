I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love  
  
Bum luck will you ever know  
I'm not in love with you  
A nice girl flown around in pretty girl limbo  
I'm not in love with you  
Not a mean bone in her body I said  
I'm not in love with you  
I love her like a bullet to the back of the head  
I'm not in love with you  
  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love  
  
Lookin' like a school girl dressed to kill  
I'm not in love with you  
A pretty girl dress would make a mean girl ill  
I'm not in love with you  
Like Jon Bonham locked to a doctor beat  
I'm not in love with you  
I need a mean girl to knock me off my feet  
I'm not in love with you  
  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love  
  
I just want mean girl to be nasty and fine  
You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine  
So what you say  
I just want mean girl to be nasty and fine  
You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine  
1 2 3 4  
I just want mean girl to be nasty and fine  
You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine  
  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love  
  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with  
I'm in love with mean girl  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love
