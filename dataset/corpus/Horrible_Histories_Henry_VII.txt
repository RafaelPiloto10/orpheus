Of all the kings called Henry, I'm the one you've rarely heard.  
Shakespeare wrote four, five, six, eight but seven not a word.  
People think I'm dreary, to some extent I am.  
But look a little closer, glam, bam, thank you mam!  
  
I didn't agree with King Richard three,  
So I fought him at Bosworth field and won, victory!  
How cool does it sound, that I'm the king who found,  
Richards crown in a hedge on the winning battle ground.  
The only way to end war and avert further disaster,  
There's got to be a way to unite York and Lancaster.  
  
I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor,  
Founder of that dynasty.  
The man who closes, the Wars of the Roses,  
That's right, that's right, that's me!  
  
I launched attacks on lords who earned stacks,  
Mine was a noble cause to tap them all for tax.  
They paid their share, was only fair,  
To making good rich and be a millionaire.  
Elizabeth York became my wife for life, that make me a bore?  
Joined our family seats, that's neat, made my rule secure.  
  
I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor,  
Returning power to the state.  
It seemed quite toothless but actually ruthless,  
I made the monarchy great.  
  
Spent a long time fighting, pretenders to the throne,  
Lambert Simnel, Perkin Warbeck said my throne was their own.  
They claimed they'd been the princes, in the tower their rule delayed,  
I said 'this crown aint big enough for the three of us' and had one slayed.  
  
I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor,  
King of foreign policy.  
Doing hostile relations with enemy nations,  
I asked them a-make friends with me.  
  
Yeh, the original ch-ch-ch Tudor,  
They say dullness my main trait.  
Well that's a sad endightment, cause if you're looking for excitement,  
My son was Henry the Eighth.
