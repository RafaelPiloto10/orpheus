Everytime I see you now it makes me feel so bad  
Reminds me of the memories I wish I never had  
Standing in a crowded room too dark for me to see  
Someone's pushing from behind, just leave me room to breathe  
  
And go away from me, just go away  
To another time, another place  
To another world, another dream  
Go away from me...  
  
Walking down the sidewalk in a crowd that doesn't care  
Bumping into shoulders every eye is on the street  
There's a man with tattered clothes who's cursing at the air  
Everyone is slowing down to catch a little peak  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Everytime I wake up and I see myself again  
Staring in the mirror like a burnt out piece of wood  
Searching every feature for a single trace of life  
Couldn't find the answer 'cause the mirror never lies  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
