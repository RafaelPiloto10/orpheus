The dark is filled with dreams  
So many dreams which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which dream of all the dreams  
  
When there's a dream for every star  
And there are oh so many stars  
So many stars  
The wind is filled with songs  
  
So many songs which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs  
When there's a song for every star  
  
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars  
Along the countless days, the endless nights  
That I have searched so many eyes  
So many hearts, so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell  
How will I know, out of, oh  
So many stars, so many stars  
  
Yes, the wind is filled with songs, so many songs  
Which one is mine, one must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs  
When there's a song for every star  
  
And there are, oh, so many stars, so many stars  
Along the countless days, the endless nights  
That I have searched so many eyes  
So many hearts, so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell  
How will I know, out of, oh, so many stars  
So many stars, (so many stars) oh, so many stars  
  
(So many stars) oh, there are so many stars  
(So many stars) lots and lots of stars, oh so many (so many)  
Oh, so many (stars), many  
So many, many (so many) stars (stars)...
