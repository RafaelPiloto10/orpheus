Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
So you want to believe  
  
Everything that you read  
And you think that you're makin' the grade  
(and) just when you're getting it made  
You're still in love with her  
She'd love you to kiss her  
Hopin' you'll miss her  
  
By takin' your mind off the load  
Just when you're ready to go  
You turn your back on her  
You just got your mind on the things ahead  
At last you're gonna be free  
You'll only miss her  
Just after you kiss her  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
So you turn on the smiles  
'cause you think of the time  
And nobody knows who you are  
You don't think you'll get very far  
I don't even know your name  
At last they accept you  
In case you go next year  
  
And ask you to reach for the sky  
And just when you're ready to die  
They turn their back on you  
So they put you on ice  
In survival hotel  
  
And wish you would die from the cold  
When all you want is a night alone  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
Dancing, and the song you sing  
Dancing, every move you make  
Dancing, makes my body go  
Dancing, right across the floor  
Dancing  
Dancing  
Dancing
