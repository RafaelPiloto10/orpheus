Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over  
  
A two-legged being on all fours  
I take him for a walk  
Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed, totally disappointed  
  
Bend over  
Your face doesn't interest me  
  
The two-legged one has bent over  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The biped stammers a prayer  
Because he's scared I'm feeling even worse  
He tries to bend over even more  
Tears run up his back  
  
Bend over  
  
Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over once more  
  
Bend over
