(You know)  
(You know listen to me)  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
(Thats true, so true)  
(You're the only girl I love to)  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world  
  
(So true, so true, listen)  
  
I wasn't tryin to lead her on  
See I didn't wanna be alone  
But when she smiles she braught me home  
So I brought her home,  
Its not that the fealin of love is gone  
Cant expect a car little girl to be grown  
I cant give a fuck what so and so says  
Crushes hurt both ways  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young  
Young girl, so in love with you  
  
The single girls are out tonight  
But you have one word, my heart, one life  
And I'm not lookin' around  
So why you lookin' down  
(What you lookin' down for?)  
  
I fucked up a long time ago  
See I should have never let you know  
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say  
(As the people magazine)  
And crushes hurt both ways  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
  
[Jay-Z]  
Hove got a young girl  
Hove got a young girl  
Still not quite 21  
So high string  
Such a vibrant thing  
I introduce myself, (hi miss thing)  
You're 19?  
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow  
The scene that follows  
Screams of horror  
Classic Steven King novel  
Momma don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance  
You should just wait  
Poppa don't preach  
Hov don't bight  
Hopin' threw it I might mo your life  
Cause ima show you right  
Proper etecit how to hold your knife  
Keep it competitive with Opras ice  
Be like Janet (take control of your life)  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do (young girl)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
Young girl, so in love with you  
(Cause I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(Cause I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
(Cause I'm never to young!)  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
  
(This is where the story begins baby)
