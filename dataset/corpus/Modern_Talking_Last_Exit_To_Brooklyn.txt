I cannot sleep - the night is young  
I cannot eat - I want some fun  
I pick you up - Route 66  
Life gives me the kick  
I cannot live - I love this life  
I cannot die - can I survive  
I cannot breathe - without your love  
I can't get enough  
  
It's the last exit to Brooklyn  
New York City, oh is waiting  
You're a new boy, you're a party guy  
Baby let's dance, and have some joy  
West coast, east side, that is the place where  
New York, L.A. I wanna live there  
New York City boy, L.A. party girl  
Baby let's dance, in a brand new world  
  
4 - 6 - 0 - 1 - East Avenue  
Why does my heart - beats just for you  
I cannot give - you more I'll give  
Baby please forgive  
I cannot tell - you thousant lies  
I have the love - right in my eyes  
The night is young - I want your heart  
Baby can we start  
  
In between  
Hold on, baby, baby hold on  
Party up, party up, party up, baby, party up, party up  
  
I can't believe - oh what I see  
I can't control - it's extacy  
I can't explain - oh what I feel  
My dream comes so real  
I cannot leave - your love alone  
I cannot go - I'm not a stone  
I cannot say - good bye to you  
When my dream comes true
