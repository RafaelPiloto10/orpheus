Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts  
First had they ear now I have they're heart  
Rappers came and went, I've been hear from the start  
Seen them put it together, watch them take it apart  
  
See the rollers roll up wit ribbons  
I see the we poe, we sold then we driven  
So when I reload, he holds number one position  
When you hot I'm hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin'  
  
It's plain to see, nigga's can't fuck wit me  
'Cuz I'ma be that nigga for life, this is not an image  
This is got given, this is hard liven  
Mixed wit crystall sippin', it's the most consistent  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma  
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat  
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in  
With that in my blood I was born to be different  
  
Now niggas can't make it to battles to chose leadership  
But we can make it to jacobs to [unverified] the dealership  
That's why I hear new music and I just dun b feelin' it  
Racism still alive they just be concealin' it  
  
But I know they don't want me in the damn club  
They even made me show I. D. To get up in to sam's club  
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed  
That why I've baptized at least 3 or 4 times  
  
But in the land where nigga's pray, you con's are getting paid  
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get [unverified]  
Notin' sadder than that day my girl father past away  
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter  
  
And you know I'd like to thank you for they way that she was brought up  
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her  
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye  
'Cuz look what a accident did to left eye  
  
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die  
I know a got angels watchin' me from the other side  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
