Remember me, I was your teacher's pet at school  
You taught me everything and how we broke the rules  
Well now I'm back to show you everything I've learned  
You play with fire you know you're getting burned  
  
[Pre-chorus:]  
Get on down, teacher, teacher get on down  
Come on, get on down, teacher , teacher get on down  
  
She's got a fire raging in between her thighs  
I got a hose to put it out, try this for size  
Well, teacher swallowed every inch of floppy love  
Guess this is what they mean by
