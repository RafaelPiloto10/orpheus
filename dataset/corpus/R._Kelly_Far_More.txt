Mansions, hill and acres  
Women, drinks and caterers  
I would toast until the break of dawn  
Swimming pools and strippers  
Conversation six figures  
Never crossed my mind to call home.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a note on the bathroom mirror  
Telling me that you've had enough.  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Than this planet to me  
Than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
Hanging out with friends  
Never calling to check in  
Neglecting you in every way  
Taking the home front for granted  
What was straight, is now slanted  
And I don't know what to do about this letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far More  
  
More than this planet to me  
More than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
I realize girl just what it is I had at home  
Oh Baby, you mean far more  
Than this planet to me  
Than this air I breath  
Nothing can compare to your love for me.  
To your love for me  
To your love for me  
To your love for me
