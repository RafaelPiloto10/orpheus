I steal the night away  
Drivin' my life away, dancin'  
I was a romeo  
I knew the art of romancin'  
I was just one of the guys  
And I thought I had it made  
I needed someone to show me how to love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
The night was magic when we first met  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
For me and my baby, Juliet  
  
Fighting with destiny, fortune and fame but kept losing  
Playin' a joker's game, only myself I was foolin'  
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams  
You've broken down all the walls with your love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
  
Close your eyes, Juliet, don't let go  
  
On and on, our love is like the sun  
It keeps going strong throughout eternity  
I wanna love you in my life, sweet Juliet  
Livin' without you in my life, oh my girl Juliet  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet, Ah...  
Juliet, oh Juliet
