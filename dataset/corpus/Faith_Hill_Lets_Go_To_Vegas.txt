Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life good-bye  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
Lyin' on the bank of the river  
Stars are dancin', Lord it's hot  
Holdin' you is what I live for  
I just had a crazy thought  
  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life good-bye  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
We'll find a little wedding chapel  
A pair of rings and a preacher too  
Underneath the neon steeple  
We'll take a gamble and say "I do"  
  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life good-bye  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
Viva Las Vegas, sparklin' lights  
Dangerous livin', tumblin' dice  
You're my ace in the hole now honey  
And I'm your lady luck  
Pack a few things and a little money  
And put 'em in the truck  
  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life good-bye  
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride
