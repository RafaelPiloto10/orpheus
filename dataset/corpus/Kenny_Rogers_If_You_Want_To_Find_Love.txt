He was sitting on a bar stool  
A picture from a cheating song  
She'd been standing by the jukebox  
Dropping quarters all night long.  
  
He said, tell me: are you lonely?  
Is there some place we can go?  
She said: cowboy, you know I'm lonely  
But there's something you should know:  
  
If you wanna find gold  
Go looking in the mountains  
If you wanna find silver  
Go digging in stones  
If you wanna find heaven  
Go reading in the Bible  
If you wanna find love  
Go looking at home.  
  
She touched the gold ring on his finger  
And held it to the jukebox light  
And she said. Stranger, think what you're losing  
If you leave here with me tonight.  
  
So he hold her body closer  
She felt feelings she'd never known  
And he said: thank you, for the lesson  
And if you need me I'll be at home.  
  
If you wanna find gold?
