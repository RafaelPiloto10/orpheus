Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town  
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around (you'll stay around)  
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in  
Chicago, Chicago, the folks who visit  
All want to settle down. (all want to settle down in my hometown)  
  
On state street, that great street, I just want to say,  
They do things they don't do on Broadway,  
You'll have the time, the time of your life  
Bring all your friends, all your kids and your wife to  
Chicago, Chicago my hometown. (Hey now baby)  
(Oh baby)  
You'll have the time, the time of your life  
Bring all your friends, all your kids and your wife to  
Chicago, Chicago my hometown.  
Oh, to Chicago, Chicago my hometown (yeah)
