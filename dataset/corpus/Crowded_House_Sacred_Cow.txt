Deliberate provocation  
Is what you gave to me  
You got me going  
You got me going  
  
How could such a simple thing  
Get so out of control  
You let me down again  
You let me down againI know my place inside your heart  
  
The painted figure that glows in the dark  
No you're not mysterious now  
I don't worship that sacred cow  
In my head  
  
In my head  
In my head  
You'd never know it  
You'd never know it  
  
I went home in a jealous rage  
You were rolling on the glass in a younger age  
You know what's good for me  
I know you're too good for me  
'Cause I have seen inside your heart  
  
Religious figures that glow in the dark  
No you're not too precious now  
And I don't worship that sacred cow  
Go and try as you may  
  
To get a sharp shift on Judgment Day  
You let me down again  
You let me down again  
I know my place inside your heart  
  
The painted figure that glows in the dark  
No you're not too precious now  
I don't worship that sacred cow  
Go and try as you may  
  
To get a sharp shift on Judgment Day  
Sacred cow  
Judgment Day  
Coming your way
