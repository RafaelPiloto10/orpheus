Well my temperature is rising got my feet on the floor  
Crazy people rocking 'cause they want to go more  
Let me in baby I don't know what you got  
But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot  
  
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it  
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme gimme some lovin'  
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high  
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire  
  
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do  
Wait a minute Baby, this could happen to you  
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high  
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire  
  
Been a hard day nothing went too good  
Now we're gonna relax just like everybody should.
