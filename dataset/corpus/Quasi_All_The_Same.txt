I'm not gonna give it up for free anymore  
And I don't really care if you label me a whore  
Frayed at the edges, busted at the seams  
I can walk with a song, sleep with my dreams  
  
You can cover up your chains, and call yourself free  
It doesn't really matter,  
It's all the same to me  
  
You're the new newest thing and we've seen it all before  
In fact I've seen it many times and I'll see it many more  
You know it won't last, you know it never does  
But better to be a has-been than to be a never-was  
You can get out with it clean or prolong the agony  
Which ever you prefer,  
It's all the same to me  
  
You worship the future like it's some kind of saint  
But it's just like the past with a new coat of paint  
Try to save a world that doesn't want to be saved  
Stolen like a child, the one you think is misbehaved  
You can say what you want or say what you see  
You can say nothing, its all the same to me
