We kill the fagots, we kill the lesbians,  
I said goddammit we kill them all!  
  
We were taught to kneel and bow our heads.  
I tried simply standing up instead.  
Heard rumors of transparent legs  
And walks for days and days.  
  
These days we reach for so much more  
We reached the point where we can't go home.  
Alone we wait here underground  
Amidst the others waiting  
  
So pray, then, if it makes you feel safe.  
But all I can is we go our own way.  
We go our own way.  
So save us.  
  
Who would guess you were the chosen one?  
The right place, you were the firstborn son.  
Once questioned stable state of mind  
To spend some time in the gutter.  
  
A full collapse and caving in  
Just wait for faith to kick in  
I lost track of time as i stood in line  
Amidst the other believers.  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
We go are own way  
So save us  
  
Over and over and I still can not believe  
We can't save ourselves  
Give me a chance up on the cross and watch me bleed.  
Now ask for help  
  
Having faith in something you can't see  
Takes something else  
Over and over and i still can not believe  
We can save ourselves  
  
So pray that if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
Send your prayers our way  
To save us  
  
Kill 'em again cuz they didn't die hard enough
