Bless my heart and soul  
I've discovered gold  
Spread the news around  
Get the ship afloat  
A rock and roll the boat  
Let's get into town  
  
I am living down by the creek  
Getting mired in the mud  
No liquor for a week  
I feel the cold in my blood  
  
Here's a very busy lady  
On her knees in the sludge  
Well I do believe she's crazy  
You know she's working like a drudge  
  
Bless my heart and soul  
She's discovered gold  
Spread the news around  
Get the ship afloat  
A rock and roll the boat  
And let's get into town  
  
Even though she smelt like a drain  
She's an angel to me  
Her intentions are plain  
And the whiskey is free  
  
Breaking out another bottle  
Keep it cool in the dirt  
Well it's a water baby heaven  
I got the papers in my shirt  
  
Bless my heart and soul  
We've discovered gold  
Spread the news around  
Get the ship afloat  
A rock and roll the boat  
And let's get into town  
  
Bless my heart and soul  
We've discovered gold  
Spread the news around  
Get the ship afloat  
A rock and roll the boat  
And let's get into town  
  
You work hard all your life little honey  
But you can't afford to save any money  
You lay it down you leave the town  
To see what you could find  
  
For more than 20 years you're a diggin'  
Then you can't believe what you are a pickin'  
It's a piece of change just like a mountain range  
Whoopee we're gonna lay it down
