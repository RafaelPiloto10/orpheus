When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always seemed  
To stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
One look was all it took  
And now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh baby, give me one more chance to  
Show you I love you  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go  
Let you go baby  
Now since I've been true where it's at  
I want you back!
