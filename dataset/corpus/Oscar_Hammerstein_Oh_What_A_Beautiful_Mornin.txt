There's a bright golden haze on the meadow  
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow  
The corn is as high as an elaphant's eye  
And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin'  
Oh what a beautiful day  
I've got a beautiful feelin'  
Everything's going my way  
  
All the cattle are standing like statues  
All the cattle are standing like statues  
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by  
But a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin'  
Oh what a beautiful day  
I've got a beautiful feeling  
Everything's going my way  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree  
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me!  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin'  
Oh what a beautiful day  
I've got a beautiful feeling  
Everything's going my way  
Oh what a beautiful day
