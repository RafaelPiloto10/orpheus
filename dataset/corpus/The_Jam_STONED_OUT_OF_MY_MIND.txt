Baby when I found out you were lying  
Playing around and conniving  
Undesired tears I was crying  
'Cause sugar coated as I was buying  
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love  
Going wherever you take me  
Don't know why I put up with the pain  
Cause no one else can make me  
  
You've got me going - stoned out of my mind  
And when you led me to the waters I drank it  
But I drank more than I could hold  
And you took my mind off my body  
And now you want to take my soul  
  
Where can I run?  
Where can I hide?  
Who can I talk to?  
Tell me what more can I do?  
  
You've got me going - stoned out of my mind  
Playing around with every guy in town  
It's funny I just can't put you down  
See my head - its spinning around  
Since the day you let me down
