I keep waiting for a song to come and sing you back to me  
I never felt so free as when I had you  
Our rhythm was the best that's touched the likes of me  
I was really me when I had you  
Give me back that old familiar feeling let me feeling like I was someone  
Give me back that song we sang in harmony just you and me singing together  
My radio still plays the songs you like to hear I wish you were here oh I need
you  
I'll take the time and tune the station in real clear as if you were here oh I
love you  
Give me back that old familiar feeling...  
Give me back that old familiar feeling...  
Give me back that old familiar feeling...
