[Verse 1]  
Hey what's up, it's been a while  
Talking 'bout it's not my style  
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
Know it's late but I'm so wired  
Saw your face and got inspired  
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, oh  
It's probably gonna sound wrong  
Promise it won't last long  
Oh, oh  
If we can never go back  
Thought you'd like to know that  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
  
[Verse 2]  
Talkin' don't want me, cause I want you  
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through  
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, oh  
It's probably gonna sound wrong  
Promise it won't last long  
Oh, oh  
If we can never go back  
Thought you'd like to know that  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
  
[Bridge]  
He can't love you like I would  
He can't love you like I could  
He don't know your body  
He don't know your body  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would
