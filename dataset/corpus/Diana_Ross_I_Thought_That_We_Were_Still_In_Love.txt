Last night while we were talking, the way that old friends do  
I suddenly got lost in my yesterdays with you  
I told you that in my heart, you would always be the one  
That I'd lie waking in the dark, pray that you will come  
But I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Oh I knew just what I'd done when you stood up so fast  
And say the friends that we'd become, can't hold on to the past  
You said it's been a long, long time, since love came to an end  
If I hadn't learned to draw the line, it's useless to pretend  
But I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
I don't think I could take goodbye, that much is still the truth  
Won't you forgive me just for one night, it's what a friend would do  
'Coz I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Still in love  
I thought that we were still in love
