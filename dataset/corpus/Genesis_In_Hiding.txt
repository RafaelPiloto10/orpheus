Pick me up, put me down  
Push me in, turn me round  
Switch me on, let me go  
I have a mind of my own  
In hiding  
Far from the city of night  
And the factories of truth  
I stand upon the mountain  
A million miles from my home  
And the faces of fear  
I have freedom to think  
In hiding  
I may take off my clothes  
That I wear on my face  
I float upon a river  
A million miles from the plains  
That are piercing the clouds  
I am lost in the beauty  
In hiding  
Pick me up, put me down  
Push me in, turn me round  
Switch me on, let me go  
I have a mind of my own  
I wish you were here  
In hiding  
I lie silent at last  
I am free from my past  
I walk among the tall trees  
This is beauty I know  
I am in love with it all  
I have freedom to love  
In hiding  
Pick me up, put me down  
Push me in, turn me round  
Switch me on, let me go  
I have a mind of my own
