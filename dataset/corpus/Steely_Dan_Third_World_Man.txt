Johnny's playroom  
Is a bunker filled with sand  
He's become a third world man  
Smoky Sunday  
He's been mobilized since dawn  
Now he's crouching on the lawn  
He's a third world man  
  
Soon you'll throw down your disguise  
We'll see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guy  
  
I saw the fireworks  
I believed that I was dreaming  
Till the neighbors came out screaming  
He's a third world man  
  
Soon you'll throw down your disguise  
We'll see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guys  
  
When he's crying out  
I just sing that Ghana Rondo  
E l'era del terzo mondo  
He's a third world man
