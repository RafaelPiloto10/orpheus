While I sit here trying to think of things to say  
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere  
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go  
I've seen all I want to see today  
  
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can  
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere  
And it would seem that we've got a long long way to go  
But I can't take it anymore  
  
Turn it off if you want to  
Switch it off it will go away  
Turn it off if you want to  
Switch it off or look away  
  
While I sit and we talk and talk and we talk some more  
Someone's loved one's heart stops beating in a street somewhere  
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go, I know  
I've heard all I want to hear today  
  
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)  
Switch it off it will go away (switch it off it will go away)  
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)  
Switch it off or look away (switch it off or look away)  
  
Switch it off  
Turn it off
