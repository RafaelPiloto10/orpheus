Don't say it's over  
Coz your girl in you ear  
All the time  
It's paranoia  
They've been playing  
Tricks on you mind  
Do they control ya  
Girl you know me better than I  
Oh let me show ya  
Oh let me show ya  
No I would never do that to you  
Girl look in my eye  
You know me won't lie  
And I would do all I can to prove  
Girl I will prove it  
If I'm guilty I would pay  
For the crime you said I made  
But I swear it wasn't me  
No I didn't do it  
If I'm giulty I would pay  
Girl I know I made mistakes  
But before you sentence me  
No I didn't do it  
I'm pleading innocent innocent  
You know me wouldn't do that to you  
Girl, I'm pleading innocent innocent  
  
I'm innocent  
They say I'm creepy  
Well they never give no evidence  
Why you belived them?  
Thought you would come to my defense  
Now you deceived it  
When I thought we were on the same side  
I see you weepin' baby just dry your eyes  
  
No I would never do that to you  
Girl look in my eye  
You know me won't lie  
And I would do all I can to prove  
Girl I will prove it  
If I'm guilty I would pay  
For the crime you said I made  
But I swear it wasn't me  
No I didn't do it  
If I'm giulty I would pay  
Girl I know I made mistakes  
But before you sentence me  
No I didn't do it  
I'm pleading innocent innocent  
You know me wouldn't do that to you  
Girl, I'm pleading innocent innocent  
I'm innocent
