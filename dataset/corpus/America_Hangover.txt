Who's that knockin' on my door this mornin'  
Can't they see I'm dead  
There ain't nothin' left to do this mornin'  
'Cept to make it to my bed  
I was out till all hours  
Raisin' Cain once again  
I don't care about the hours  
Only how much did I spend  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
I started slow after sundown  
I tiptoed right up till ten  
Then after while I went downtown  
It was the beginning of my end  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Oh, how am I gonna stake my claim on the future  
When I cannot lift my head  
Oh, I ain't nothin' but a drunken loser  
And my liver's overfed  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
So just leave me where I lay
