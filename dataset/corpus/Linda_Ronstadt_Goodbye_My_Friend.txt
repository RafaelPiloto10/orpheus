Oh we never know where life will take us  
I know it's just a ride on the wheel.  
And we never know when death will shake us  
And we wonder how it will feel.  
  
So goodbye my friend  
I know I'll never see you again  
But the time together through all the years  
Will take away these tears  
  
It's OK now...  
Goodbye my friend  
  
I see a lot of things that make me crazy  
And I guess I held on to you  
I could of run away and left  
Well, maybe...  
But it wasn't time we both knew  
  
So goodbye my friend  
I know I'll never see you again  
But the love you gave me through all the years  
Will take away these tears  
  
It's now...  
Goodbye my friend  
  
Life's so fragile and love's so pure  
We can't hold on but we try  
We watch how quickly it disappears  
And we never know why  
  
But I'm OK now  
Goodbye my friend.  
I can go now  
Goodbye my friend.
