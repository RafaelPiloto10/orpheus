Stones falling down  
Rollercoaster, heart pound?  
Fears overplayed...  
Two left feet emergency.  
  
Wide open space  
Catch my tail,  
Fishing net.  
Fold up my frown  
Take the rage  
And smooth it out.  
  
Stick to my skin,  
Paper mache face to live in.  
Same view to paint,  
Watercolour your name  
  
Face your mistakes  
(You will never have to feel that way again)  
Oil your chains, under rate.  
(You will never have to feel that way again)  
Read every page,  
Press the dents (of my) fighter plane  
  
I held the fort, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken
the falls oh I have fought, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I
have broken the falls  
  
Fighter Plane  
Fly away!
