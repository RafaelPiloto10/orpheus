All Along  
Deep inside secret's burning  
I Should have known all the while what's true  
I went along, to fool myself  
  
Can't go on, I can't escape it  
All along  
I think I really knew  
It was there in the words unspoken  
  
All along  
Still believed in you  
Now I stand here betrayed and broken  
Close my eyes from the burning  
  
All along all the while it's true  
Take it on, or turn your back  
Either way, you can't escape it
