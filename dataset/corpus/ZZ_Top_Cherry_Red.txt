Strange things goin' through my head. Oh!  
Crazy things that I think she said.  
Slides so slinky that it's gotta be real.  
she just want to know how to feel.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
She just want to feel cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
She just want to feel cherry red.  
This town of killer tits is doing me in.  
Tried to leave once want to do it again.  
But this one little thing's such a thoroughbred.  
I'm addicted to the feel of her cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
Addicted to the feel of her cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
I want to keep thinkin' 'bout cherry red.  
Whip out a bottle of your favorite rave  
I think you better tend to your cherry crave  
Ain't nothin' stupid what we're talking about  
Take a little twist and then you pour it on out  
Cherry red, cherry red  
Think you better tend to your cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
I think you better give me that cherry red.
