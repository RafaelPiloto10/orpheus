I have been unfaithful  
I have been unworthy  
I have been unrighteous  
And I have been unmerciful  
  
I have been unreachable  
I have been unteachable  
I have been unwilling  
And I have been undesirable  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes, I have been unwise  
I've been undone by what I'm unsure of  
But because of you, and all that you went through  
I know that I have never been unloved  
  
I have been unbroken  
I have been unmended  
I have been uneasy  
And I've been unapproachable  
  
I've been unemotional  
I've been unexceptional  
I've been undecided  
And I have been unqualified  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unaware, I have been unfair  
I've been unfit for blessings from above  
But even I can see the sacrifice you made for me  
To show that I have never been unloved
