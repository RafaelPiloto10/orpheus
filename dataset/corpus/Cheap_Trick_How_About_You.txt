Never started out first  
Never finished last  
Like to change the pace  
Like to change it fast  
And I'm ready to try  
Just can't sit around here too long  
I can feel the wheels are spinning strong  
Does anyone feel the same as me  
Does anyone disagree  
Well how 'bout you  
I said goodbye to bad luck  
I've had enough  
But I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you  
  
Do you like your love soft and warm  
Do you like it hard, hot and long  
Like you're ready to die  
Sometimes I feel all wound up  
Head starts spinnin', it'll never stop  
Does anyone feel the same as me  
Does anyone disagree  
Well how 'bout you  
I said bad times kiss them goodbye  
I want changes, but  
I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you  
  
I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you
