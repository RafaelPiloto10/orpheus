Oh, Danny boy  
The pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen  
And down the mountainside  
  
The summer's gone  
And all the roses falling  
It's you, it's you must go  
And I must bide  
  
But come ye back when  
Summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed  
And white with snow  
  
It's I'll be here in  
Sunshine or in shadow  
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy  
I love you so  
  
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy  
I love you so
