It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart  
If you accidentally crush it on the ides of March  
I'd prefer you were straight forward  
You don't have to go through all of that  
I'm a New York city man, baby  
Say "go" and that is that  
  
New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that  
I'm a New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that  
  
It's far too complicated to make up a lie  
That you'd have to remember and really why  
I wouldn't want to be around you  
If you don't want to have me around  
I'm a M-A-N-N man  
Slink your eyes and I'll gone  
  
I'm a M-A-N-N man, slink your eyes, honey, I love you, and I'll gone  
New York city man, slink your eyes and I'll gone  
  
Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed  
Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain  
Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play  
But I'm no Lear with blinded eyes  
Say " go " and I am gone  
  
The stars have shut their eyes up tight  
The earth has changed it's course  
A Kingdom sits on a black knight's back  
As he tries to mount a white jeweled horse  
While a clock full of butterflies on the hour  
Releases a thousand moths  
You say " leave" and I'll be gone  
Without any remorse  
No letters faxes phones or tears  
There's a difference between  
Bad and worse  
  
I'm a New York city man, blink your eyes and I'll be gone  
New York city - man, blink your eyes and I'll be gone  
  
New York city, I love you, New York city man  
New York city, I love you, blink your eyes and I'll be gone  
Just a little grain of sand  
New York city, ooohhh, I love you  
New York city, baby, blink your eyes and I'll be gone  
I love you
