I'm comin' out  
Mmmm.....  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin' out

(I'm comin')  
I'm comin' out (comin') I wan the world to know, I got to let it show.  
  
There's a new me comin' out  
And I just have to live  
And I wanna give  
I'm completely positive  
  
I think this time around  
I just wanna do it  
Like ya never knew it  
Ya know I'll make it through  
  
The time has come for me to break out of this shell  
I have to shout, that I am comin' out  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
There's a night to show the world  
All that I want to be  
And all my abilities  
Cuz there's so much more to me  
  
Some how I'll have to make them  
Just understand  
I've got it well in hand  
And oh how I have planned  
  
I'm spreding love, there is no need to fear  
And I just feel so good, every time I hear  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm comin' out  
I'm comin'  
I'm, comin', out  
I'm comin'  
I'm, comin', out  
I'm comin'  
I'm, comin', out!!!  
Said I'm comin' out! Yeah!  
  
[Chorus:]
