Southern trees bear Strange Fruits  
Blood on the leaves, blood at the roots  
Black (belly's) body's swinging in the southern reek  
Strange fruit hanging from the popular tree.  
  
Past star will sing from the gallon south  
Bulging eyes and a twisted mouth  
Send up magnolia, sweet and fresh  
And the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is the fruit for the crows to pluck  
For (but) the rain to gather for the wind to suck  
For the sun to rot for the tree to drop  
Here is the strange and bitter crop.
