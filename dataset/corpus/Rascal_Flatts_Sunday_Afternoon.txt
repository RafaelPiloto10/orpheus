I swear it feels just like  
The clocks slow down for a while  
And the air tastes sweeter  
And breathing gets deeper  
As the clouds dance around the sunshine  
  
I hear the church bells ring  
Blowing in with the breeze, yeah  
As I stare in your eyes  
Thanking God for this life that he's given me  
You're a gift to me  
  
If I had the chance to make one wish  
Every single moment would be like this  
Laying here baby, just me and you  
Yeah, and every day would be Sunday afternoon  
(Sunday) oh yeah Sunday (Sunday)  
  
Just the touch of your hand  
It fixes everything  
It gets my heartbeat moving  
Like it's singing hallelujah  
You're the only place I wanna be  
Right where I wanna be  
  
If I had the chance to make one wish  
Every single moment would be like this  
Laying here baby, just me and you  
Yeah, and every day would be Sunday afternoon  
Oh yeah, baby  
  
If I had the chance to make one wish  
Every single moment would be like this  
Laying here baby, just me and you  
That's exactly what I'd do, yeah that's what I'd do  
  
If I had the chance to make one wish  
Every single moment would be like this  
Laying here baby, just me and you  
Yeah, and every day would be Sunday  
Every day would be Sunday afternoon  
Oh, just the touch of your hand  
Sunday afternoon  
Everything Sunday, Sunday afternoon
