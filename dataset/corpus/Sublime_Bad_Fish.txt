When you grab a hold of me  
Tell me that I'll never be set free  
But I'm a parasite,  
Creep and crawl I step into the night.  
Two pints of booze  
Tell me are you a badfish too?  
Are you a badfish too?  
Ain't got no money to spend  
I hope the night will never end  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Baby you're a big blue whale  
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails  
I swim, but wish I'd never learned  
The water's too polluted with germs  
I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead  
Grab the reef underneath my bed (it's underneath my bed)  
Ain't got no quarrels with God  
Ain't got no time to grow old  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Ain't got no quarrels with God  
Ain't got no time to get old  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef
