I'm better off without you  
I'm better off you know  
We're nothing more than strangers  
With nowhere else to go  
But like a fool I'll stay by your side  
Knowing that you won't believe me  
When I say I've tried  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
We made no commitment  
We made only words  
It's no consolation that we're free like the birds  
'cause who needs to fly like they do  
There's only one reason I'm staying  
It's 'cause I love you...i do  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
Tonight it's gonna break  
Don't know if I'll make it  
Through' the night...oh oh oh oh...
