I've been saying that I'd  
Leave well enough alone  
Now I'm behaving  
Like I'm begging you for a bone  
When it feels good you can't help it  
You just hang by the phone  
And it felt that good last night  
I can't give it up  
  
You come on like a prince  
You got everyone convinced  
That you're a prince of a man  
But I'm the one who knows you  
I'm the one you show that you  
Don't give a damn  
Can't give it up, oh no, can't give it up  
  
I've been dreaming you'd fall in love with me  
No cold blooded scheming  
If it could be that easy  
But you still fight it  
And I must like it  
That I have to reach for what I want  
And as long as it feels that good  
I can't give it up  
  
I don't want to want you  
I don't want to want you  
'Cause you can't give, can't give  
No, I don't want you cause you  
Can't give
