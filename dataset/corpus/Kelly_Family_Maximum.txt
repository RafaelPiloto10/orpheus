Maximum, maximum, power on my side  
But it's minimum, minimum without you  
Maximum, maximum, power on my side  
But it's minimum, minimum without you  
It's my therapy you can never understand  
What it means to me I'm an Ironman  
It's my therapy it's a battle inside of me  
It's a battle I fight for my family  
Chorus  
It's my therapy it's my way of curing me  
It's my recipe for my liberty  
It's my therapy it's too hard to understand  
What I'm going throu' I'm a happy man  
Chorus  
Chorus  
But it's minimum without you
