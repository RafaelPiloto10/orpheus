Chorus:  
I'mma make your body love when you leave the club  
Oh, all I really want you to do is scream my name  
And nobody else... love me girl!  
Cause you got...  
  
Who is she? She got a special type of perfume  
And... full of tricks looking her move.  
I feel guilty, cause I ain't offered her no free VIP yet  
Girl I know you wanna drink, just dance for me?  
You not gonna regret cause I ain't got... all that hundreds,  
Girl you look so amazing when you do it!  
There's no one to... to play my music, for her! Huh, I bet you!  
  
I can feel you looking my way  
And my body is all alone here in the days, oh!  
You think you gonna take me home,  
You know I'm thinking it too  
It's on my mind!  
Cause I got... all I got...  
Don't look so amazing when I do it  
Why we're still wasting time, let's do it  
Get your car!

Can you love? Yeah!  
Yes I do! Do you love me!  
Baby we can do it all night  
Till the morning like a rodeo  
And you read by my side,  
I got the glasses, I got the liquor,  
I got the... I'm about to switch her... !
