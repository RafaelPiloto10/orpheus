Valhalla the gods await me  
Open wide thy gates embrace me.  
Great hall of the battle slain  
With sword in hand.  
All those who stand on shore  
Raise high your hands to bid a last  
Farewell to the viking land.  
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair  
I'm now immortal, I am there  
I take my place by Odin's side  
Eternal army in the sky.  
I point my hatchet to the wind  
I guard the gates and all within  
Hear my sword sing as I ride across the sky  
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.  
Valhalla the gods await me  
Open wide thy gates embrace me  
Great hall of the battle slain  
With sword in hand.  
Behold the kingdom of the kings  
Books of spells and magic rings  
Endless knowledge, endless time  
I scream the final battle cry.
