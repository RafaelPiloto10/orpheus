They tell me you're a shy boy  
But I want you just the same  
Don't play innocent with me  
You know it's not just fun and games  
When I look into your eyes  
So much passion burns inside  
But if you need some coaxing  
I will do it  
Step by step there's nothing to it  
  
1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me  
5-6-7 times  
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting  
Until you are mine  
  
Come out of your shell, boy  
You know we go like hand in glove  
You're afraid of giving in  
But I am never giving up on your love  
And no matter what it takes  
I will steal your heart away  
Take a chance for once you won't regret it  
Want my love just come and get it  
  
1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me  
5-6-7 times  
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting  
Until you are mine  
  
So no matter what it takes  
I will steal your heart away  
Take a chance for once you won't regret it  
Want my love just come and get it  
  
1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me  
5-6-7 times  
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting  
Until you are mine

5-6-7 times  
You got to give me your love  
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting baby  
Until you are mine
