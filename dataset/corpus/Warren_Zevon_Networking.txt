There's a way to live that's right for us  
Like Mayans in Manhattan and Los Angeles  
I'm scaling up, I'm breaking down  
And I'm doing lunch all over town  
  
Networking, I'm user friendly  
Networking, I install with ease  
Data processed, truly Basic  
I will upload you, you can download me  
  
There's a long, hard road and a full hard drive  
And a sector there where I feel alive  
Every bit and every byte  
Is written down once on the night  
  
Networking, I'm user friendly  
Networking, I install with ease  
Data processed, truly Basic  
I will upload you, you can download me  
  
There's a prayer each night that I always pray  
Let the data guide me through every day  
And every pulse and every code  
Deliver me from the bypass mode  
  
Networking, I'm user friendly  
Networking, I install with ease  
Data processed, truly Basic  
I will upload you, you can download me
