Stop, na, na, na, you better save me  
Stop! Stop! Stop!  
You better save me yeah, yeah!  
  
When we played tag in grade school,  
you wanted to be it.  
You chased those boys, you testified,  
You crossed your heart, you quit.  
When we grew up you traded your promise  
For my ring. Now just like back in grade school  
You're doin' the same old thing.  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Darlin' take it slow or someday you'll be all alone,  
better stop the love you save may be your own.  
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me  
You're heading for a danger zone.  
  
I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one you need.  
Those other guys will put you down, As soon as they succeed.  
They'll ruin your reputation, they'll label you a flirt.  
The way they talk about you. They'll turn your name to dirt.  
Issac said he kissed you, underneath the apple tree.  
When Benji held your hand, you felt the electricity.  
When Alexander called you, you said he rang your chimes.  
Christopher discovered you're way ahead of your time.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
S is for Save me!  
T is for Take it Slow!  
O is Oh No!  
P is for Please, Please don't go!  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Someday you may be all alone.  
Stop it, save me girl. Baby you better stop  
The love you save may be your own.  
  
Darlin' take it slow or someday  
You'll be all alone. I'm the one who loves you.  
I'm the one you need. Those other guys will put you down,  
As soon as they succeed.  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Baby stop it,stop it, stop it,  
girl you're heading for a danger zone.
