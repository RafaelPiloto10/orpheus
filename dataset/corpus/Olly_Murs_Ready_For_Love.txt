There's a line and it's hard to cross  
Scared to say the things will be both feel  
And all my life I have been so lost  
Running for every reap that's real  
Now I wanna see the lights and I wanna see it all  
I'm ready for the rise even if we fall  
I don't wanna be alone, I wanna wake and see the sun  
Dive and hear those only, just begun  
  
And I'm singing  
Shouting out, singing loud, I got some things to say  
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name  
Can I kiss you cuz the night is closen in  
Ooh I, ooh I I'm ready for this  
I come alive, feel alive with you on my way  
There's a room in my heart, do you want to stay?  
And I show you that you all Im thinking of  
Oh I, ooh I'm ready for love  
  
If what you have make you insecure  
But I don't mind if you feel, I'm sure  
I heard you say it will be before  
But close your eyes and fit with you no more  
  
Do you wanna see the lights?  
Do you wanna see it all?  
Are you ready for the rise even if we fall?  
I don't wanna be alone, want that we can see the sun  
Cuz darling we have only just begun  
  
And I'm singing  
Shouting out, singing loud, I got some things to say  
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name  
Can I kiss you cuz the night is closen in  
Ooh I, ooh I I'm ready for this  
I come alive, feel alive with you on my way  
There's a room in my heart , do you want to stay?  
And I show you that you all Im thinking of  
Oh I, ooh I'm ready for love  
  
And I know what we've been throw, the hard times we living  
Just take my hand and I will lead you to something new  
You and I will walk in time  
There's no need to running  
Take my hand and I will show you my love is true  
  
And I'm singing  
Shouting out, singing loud, I got some things to say  
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name  
Can I kiss you cuz the night is clones in  
Ooh I, ooh I I'm ready for the  
I come alive, feel alive with you on my way  
There's a room in my heart, do you want to stay?  
And I show you that you all Im thinking of  
Oh I, ooh I'm ready for love  
Oh I, ooh I'm ready for love
