I used to live around here  
I was the boy with the flash clothes  
She was the girl with the acid stare  
I saw her at The Place  
You know she knows you know  
How she shakes when she jacks her body  
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones and  
Jocelyn Brown  
  
Oh spread your wings before they fall apart  
Home is where the hurt is darling  
Follow your heart  
  
So she walks into this dead end bar  
Sticks her handbag on the chair  
So she walks into this dead end bar  
Puts hers handbag on the chair  
And she weights the words we shared  
When we were fifteen and still cared  
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound  
That time can't heal  
  
And I said  
Don't let your dreams out of your head  
Stick it to the man instead  
Don't fool your heart lying about  
The feelings that you had back then  
Did you try to change your life?  
Did you ever try to change your life?  
You repeat and repeat  
And repeat and repeat  
Now what's up with that?  
  
Now she loves somebody else  
In flash clothes  
She was the girl with the acid stare  
And now she'd pay to have one of those  
  
And she weighs the word she says  
And she knows you exist  
Now she feels  
I'm the scar from the wound  
That time can't heal  
  
Oh spread your wings before they fall apart  
Home is where the hurt is darling  
Follow your heart  
  
Spread your wings before they fall apart  
Home is where the hurt is darling  
Follow your heart  
Heart, heart
