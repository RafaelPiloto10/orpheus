I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall  
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall  
I know he's there, but I just had to call  
  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
I heard your mother now she's going out the door  
Did she go to work or just go to the store  
  
All those things she said, I told you to ignore  
Oh why can't we talk again  
Oh why can't we talk again  
Oh why can't we talk again  
  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long  
If I don't get your call then everything goes wrong  
I want to tell you something you've known all along  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation  
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation  
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection  
  
Oh I can't control myself  
Oh I can't control myself  
Oh I can't control myself  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
Hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah oh oh oh run to me
