In this ever-changing world  
Where things become unfurled  
And tethered  
Like a lioness in her pride  
I was gonna stay by your side  
Forever  
  
As a planet keeps her moon  
Your love I had assumed  
And taken  
And if this love can't come to pass  
Then I would be alas  
Forsaken  
  
[Chorus]  
The drama of the chase  
The look upon your face  
Make up your mind  
It would be a waste  
If you didn't love me  
It would be the drama of all time  
  
If I'm not good enough for you  
What else could I do?  
I could change  
You know, they say like wine  
You get better with passin' time  
How strange ?.  
I wish that in your eyes  
You saw me like the others  
See me  
I could never say enough  
Darlin' just how much I  
Wish you'd keep me  
  
[Chorus]  
Drama, drama of all time  
It's been ten long years  
Since I fell in love so dear  
It's got to be the drama of all time  
Called you on the telephone  
And wondered if you were alone  
It's got to be the drama of all time  
When I called you back, it was busy  
What was that?  
It's a drama, drama of all time  
Who were you with last night?  
Busy, busy, you must be busier  
Than a one-legged man in a kick fight  
Got to be the drama of all time  
Drama, drama of all time
