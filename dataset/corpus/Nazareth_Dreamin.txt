Dreamin? I saw a spirit in the sky  
I'm dreamin? Dreaming away again  
I felt a cold wind rushing in  
And carry me up high  
Far above the maddening crowd I fly  
Its so exciting  
Electrifying  
And I can see theres no dreams  
  
Dreamin? I saw a strange light in the sky  
I'm dreamin? Dreaming away again  
  
I felt this power touching me  
Reelin? In my lies  
Visions came,  
My heart began to rise  
Its so exciting  
Electrifying  
I feel the sun is in my dreams  
  
I've seen the wild side of city lights  
Walked the streets where the lightning strikes  
I've heard the thunder and I know  
But I've never had such feelings before  
In my dreams  
Dreamin? Away again  
Dreamin? Away again  
Dreamin? I saw a spirit in the sky  
I'm dreaming  
I saw a strange light in the sky  
I'm dreaming  
I saw a shadow passing by  
I'm dreaming  
Dreamin? Away again  
I'm dreaming  
Dreamin? Away again  
Dreamin? Dreamin? Away again  
Dreamin.......
