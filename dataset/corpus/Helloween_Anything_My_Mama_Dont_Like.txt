I'm no believer  
I just listen to my own head  
I'm no believer  
I just call you liar instead  
  
Keep all your sorrows  
Words might be the  
pathetically vain  
Life is a fire  
Light and you can read your name  
  
I'm the king of a night generation  
I'm anithing my  
mama don't like  
I'm a slave of a perveted nation  
Anything my mama don't like  
  
I am a flyer  
Rising in the wake of my dreams  
I am a tumbler  
Life can be as good as it seems  
  
I'm a child playing chess with tomorrow  
I'm anything my  
mama don't like  
I'm a clown, I'm a beg steal and borrow  
Anything my mama don't like  
  
I'm the king of a night generation  
I'm anithing my  
mama don't like  
I'm a slave of a perveted nation  
Anything my mama don't like
