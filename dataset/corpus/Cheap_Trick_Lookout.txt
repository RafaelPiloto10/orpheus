There is somewhere, someplace  
In this world I want to take you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
I am one boy, one boy in a thousand  
That wants to make you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
If you're hiding and I'm hiding  
From some bum that wants to get you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
If you're lonely and I'm lonely  
And I'm near you I can hear you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
Sea over yonder when the rights are read your name-ah  
You search for the riddle to the clue the river she came  
Look out on the land to the south  
To the east three said-ah  
Cancel Colorado in the march  
By request  
Don't go on the look out of a whim  
Aye she said
