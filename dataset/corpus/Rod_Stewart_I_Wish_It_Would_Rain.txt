How you doin', Annaheim? I don't know what else to call ya'  
If I knew all your names, I'd call ya' your bloody names  
Here's one that we did when we was here  
Were many of you here last night?  
  
Alright, well I changed me shirt anyway  
No, I haven't changed me trousers  
  
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away  
My love has found another, gone away  
Withered up my future, my life is filled with gloom  
Day after day I stay locked up in my room  
I know to you it might sound strange  
But I wish it would rain  
  
Curse so badly, I don't want to go outside  
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry  
Listen, I've got to cry, 'cause crying sheds the pain  
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain  
I wish it would rain  
  
Let it rain  
  
Looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane  
But I search the sky desperately for rain  
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops, no one will ever know  
When I'm crying, crying when I go outside  
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain  
I wish it would rain  
  
Let it rain  
Like that number [unverified]
