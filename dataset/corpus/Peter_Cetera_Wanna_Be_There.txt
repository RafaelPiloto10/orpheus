I want to be there  
When you turn out the lights  
I want to be there  
  
But I'm here on this lonely highway  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
I want to hold you  
If you wake up in the night  
I want to hold you  
  
I want to be there in the morning  
I want to touch you  
'Cause you know tonight  
There's nowhere else that I would rather be  
  
I'm not the same when you're not here with me  
Close your eyes and say a little prayed  
And baby I'm gonna be there  
  
I want to be there  
I want to be there  
want to be there in the morning  
Oh, I want to be there
