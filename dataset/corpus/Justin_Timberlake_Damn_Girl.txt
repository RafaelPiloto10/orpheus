Really special girls  
Gave all my time and money  
But, there something 'bout ya  
Something that's kinda funny  
It's what you do to me  
  
Don't need no Maybelleine  
'Cause you're a beauty queen  
Don't need no L'Oreal  
'Cause, bitch, you're bad as hell  
  
If I'm a Casanova  
Then you're a supernova  
Girl, it's what you do to me  
That's got me saying

The way you let me put it down

When I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of you  
When you're gone, I've been screaming for ya

Take you out to dinner and catch the funky stuff  
Can we spend time, I'll never get enough
