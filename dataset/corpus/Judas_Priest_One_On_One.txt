I am your darkest hour  
I am your fall from power  
I am the voice you dread and I'm  
Screaming out inside your head  
  
I am the final count  
I am your demons out  
I am the worst demise  
I'm gonna cut your big words down to size  
  
What is this?  
I hear you shout  
Face to face  
I'm gonna take you out  
  
One on one, bring it on  
One on one, take me on  
  
I am the awful truth  
I am the fearless youth  
I am the cross to bear  
And the one who dares to return your stare  
  
I am the fist of God  
I am the underdog  
I'll always stand my ground  
While the others scatter all around  
  
Against all odds  
Despite it all  
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall  
  
One on one, bring it on  
One on one, take me on  
  
I am the bloodstained past at last  
That's finally caught up with you like  
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last  
Thing you will feel - I'm outgunned, I'm out  
  
Run, I'm undead and then I found the skin  
You shed I am the questions asked  
That send the shivers down your back  
  
So I am holding out  
And I'm much stronger now  
So take me on  
  
One on one, bring it on  
One on one, take me on  
  
I am the darkest night  
I am the viper's strike  
I'll see you all consumed  
As you start to lick your mortal wounds  
  
Like the condemned man  
Who just won't die  
I'll show no remorse  
I'll never walk away  
  
One on one, bring it on  
One on one, take me on
