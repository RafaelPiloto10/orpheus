I threw a party. Nobody came.  
I bought all the tickets. They cancelled the game.  
I give you my picture. It didn't fit your frame  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
  
Now you bring the glasses and Ill bring the wine  
Ill rub your shoulders just like they were mine  
I won't make no passes till its passing time  
If you're only gonna be my buddy tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
  
Well, Ill mind my manners. My p's and q's  
I won't give you nothing that you can't use  
Ill whip out that old guitar and sing you the blues  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
Be my friend tonight. be my friend tonight.  
  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on darling, be my friend tonight  
Oh, come on honey, be my friend tonight  
Please, be my friend tonight.
