Since you're the delegate from Kansas  
Will you kindly take the floor?  
Now tell us, what is Kansas thinkin'?  
What is Kansas for?  
  
Well Kansas is for the farmer  
We stand behind the little man  
We need a fire house in Topeka  
So help us if you can  
  
I see the gentleman from Utah  
Our friendly Beehive State  
How can we help you Utah?  
How can we make you great?  
  
We got to irrigate our deserts  
We got to get some things to grow  
We got to tell this country about Utah  
'Cause nobody seems to know
