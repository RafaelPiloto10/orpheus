Don't you know, so many things they come and go  
Like your words that once rang true  
Like the love I thought I found in you  
And I remember the thunder,  
Talkin' 'bout that fire in your eyes  
But you walked away when I needed you most  
Now, maybe baby, maybe baby  
  
Chorus:  
I found someone, to take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness  
I've been feelin' since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
  
Dry your eyes, I could never bear to see you cry  
Someday your love will shine through  
Show ya the feelins' that ya never really knew  
But baby don't ya lose that thunder  
Talkin' 'bout that fire in your eyes  
You're lookin' at me but ya don't believe  
Now, maybe baby, maybe baby  
  
Chorus:  
  
Too long on the borderline  
Wonderin' if your love was really mine  
But you left me with open eyes  
That's when I realized, and I realized  
  
Chorus:  
And baby, I found someone  
To take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness  
I've been livin' with since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone
