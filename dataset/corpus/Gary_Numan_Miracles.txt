I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in forgiving  
I don't believe in I can go on  
I won't remember why  
I don't believe in long goodbyes  
Never look back for me  
  
It's over  
And everything has gone  
And everything has gone away  
  
I don't remember the faces  
I don't remember the feelings  
I don't remember your stories  
I won't remember you  
I don't remember our secrets  
My God just look at me
