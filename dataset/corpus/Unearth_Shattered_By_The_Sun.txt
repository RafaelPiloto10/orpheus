Crossed a plain that left behind dark days.  
Filled a void that I thought could not be replaced.  
Now gone it seems so out or reach.  
  
I have lived. I have felt.  
It's what we need.  
Gone.  
What have I done?  
Found what I've been looking for.  
One time I believe my eyes. This time.  
  
This time my instincts controlled me.  
No need to search on for any more.  
I feel as one with myself. I look no more.  
  
Now a lifetime decision.  
What will the future hold?  
This time they lied.  
  
I felt you slip away.  
A feeling under my skin.  
I tried again and again.  
I did not save you this time.  
  
Holding on to something that I once believed in.  
Will time show me if this was really meant to be.  
  
Show me what this really means to you  
Fall even though I showed you ev-ery-thing that I stand for.  
I hate everything without you.  
Life falls and crumblers in my hand.  
Faith is dead.  
It's something I can't stand.  
Dreams, hope, gone.  
Just a one time thing.  
Far away are the days that we once shared.  
  
I never thought I could change.  
I would be walking a dead day.  
You believed in me and knew I could change.  
Came in my life and became my best friend.  
Now I have been forced away.  
Unwillingly out on my own.  
I never wanted to lose this much.  
You broke a trust that was our own.  
I feel shattered by the sun.  
Now I'm shattered by the sun.
