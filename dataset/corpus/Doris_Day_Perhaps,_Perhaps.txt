Ba da, ba da, ba da da da  
Ba da, ba da, ba da da da  
  
You won't admit you love me  
And so how am I ever to know?  
You always tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
A million times I've asked you,  
And then I ask you over again  
You only answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't wanna wind up  
Being parted, broken-hearted  
  
So if you really love me  
Say yes, but if you don't dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
Perhaps, perhaps, (giggle) perhaps
