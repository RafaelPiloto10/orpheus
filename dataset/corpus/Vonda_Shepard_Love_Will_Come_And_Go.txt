Do you want me to read your mind?  
Oh if I only could  
I wonder if I'd find the same  
Hopes I've been having  
'Cause baby I came alive  
When you caught my eye  
I'm falling in love you see  
And it's the kind of love  
That makes me breathe  
  
I would share all my secrets  
I would tell you anything  
You know I'd let you in darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
If only you would take it from me  
  
Sometimes love comes quickly  
Sometimes love comes slow  
Let's not miss this moment...'cause  
Love will come and go  
  
I never thought I could feel  
Such emotion in me  
I'm not the kinda girl who falls in love so easily  
It's all so clear to me now  
Ain't no shadow of a doubt  
Now I understand what this mystery is all about  
  
I would be there for you baby  
In a special kind of way  
If I only had the say darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
Baby will you take it from me  
  
Sometimes love comes quickly  
Sometimes love comes slow  
Let's not miss this moment...'cause  
Love will come and go  
  
Let's not miss this moment  
Let's not take too long  
I think we both know it  
Our love would be that strong, be that strong, be that strong  
  
I would be there for you baby  
In a special kind of way  
'Cause I love you darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
Baby will you take it from me
