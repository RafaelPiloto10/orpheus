What I need from you is understanding  
How can we communicate  
If you don't here what I say  
What I need from you is understanding  
So simple as 1,2,3  
Understanding is what I need  
  
You don't even know me  
You just wanna do what you wanna do  
That's not the way it should be no  
You should listen to me, boy  
I tried so very hard to make you understand  
But the chooses you make  
Baby they're all demands oh  
  
I tried so very hard  
To keep our love alive  
But you don't wanna meet me half way  
Then the understanding dies  
  
There's no way that we can work it out  
If we don't pull together  
I don't mean to be demanding  
I want some understanding  
I wanna be with you
