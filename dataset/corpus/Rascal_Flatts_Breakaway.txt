Opened my eyes this morning with a smile on my face  
My arms wrapped around you, took me away  
And it got me to thinkin', what we need to do  
Is take a Sunday drive, and drive on through  
Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday too  
  
Let's disappear, gotta jet out of here  
Feel the wind across our face  
We'll have some fun, gonna dance on the run  
It's a perfect day to break away  
  
We'll hit Tulsa by Tuesday, follow the stars above  
Spend the weekend in Vegas and gamble on sweet, sweet love  
It don't matter what we do, as long as I'm with you  
  
Let's disappear, gotta jet out of here  
Feel the wind across our face  
We'll have some fun, gonna dance on the run  
It's a perfect day to break away  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Break away  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Let's disappear, gotta jet out of here  
Feel the wind across our face  
We'll have some fun, gonna dance on the run  
It's a perfect day to break away  
  
Let's disappear, gotta jet out of here  
Feel the wind across our face  
We'll have some fun, gonna dance on the run  
It's a perfect day...  
  
Girl, it's a perfect day to break away
