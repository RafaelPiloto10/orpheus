Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
  
To live without my music  
Would be impossible to do  
In this world of troubles  
My music pulls me through  
  
Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
And music of the past  
And music of the past  
  
Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
  
To live without my music  
Would be impossible to do  
'Cause in this world of troubles  
My music pulls me through
