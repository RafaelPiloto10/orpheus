I woke up this morning, and I fell out of bed  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Should've quit while I was ahead  
Trouble waiting to happen  
  
I turned on the news to the Third World War  
Opened up the paper to World War Four  
Just when I thought it was safe to be bored  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Trouble waiting to happen  
  
The mailman brought me the Rolling Stone  
Trouble waiting to happen  
It said I was living at home alone  
Trouble waiting to happen  
  
I read things I didn't know I'd done  
It sounded like a lot of fun  
I guess I've been bad or something  
  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Teardrops ready to start  
Trouble waiting to happen to my heart  
  
This just ain't gonna be my day  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Things just ain't gonna go my way  
Trouble waiting to happen  
  
My day was over by a quarter to ten  
I climbed right back into bed again  
I'd write this down if I could hold a pen  
I might get better, but I don't know when  
So I'm gonna wait right here till then  
  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Trouble waiting to happen  
Teardrops ready to start  
Trouble waiting to happen to us all
