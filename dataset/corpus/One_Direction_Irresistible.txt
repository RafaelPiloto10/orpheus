Don't try to make me stay  
Or ask if I'm okay  
I don't have the answer  
Don't make me stay the night  
Or ask if I'm alright  
I don't have the answer.  
  
Heartache doesn't last forever  
I'll say I'm fine  
Midnight ain't no time for laughing  
When you say goodbye.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible.  
  
I've tried to ask myself  
Should I see someone else?  
I wish I knew the answer.  
  
But I know, if I go now, if I leave  
Then I'm on my own tonight  
I'll never know the answer.  
  
Midnight doesn't last forever  
Dark turns to light  
Heartache flips my world around  
I'm falling down, down, down,  
That's why.  
  
I find your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible).  
  
It's in your lips and in your kiss  
It's in your touch and your fingertips  
And it's in all the things and other things  
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
Irresistible.
