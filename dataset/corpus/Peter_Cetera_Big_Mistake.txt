Keeps them all waiting  
They're standing in line  
He never has to worry about being alone  
He's taking his own sweet time  
  
The man's mighty hot  
Believe it or not  
Every woman's after what the big boy's got  
They know it's all a lie but they're taking their shot  
  
He is such a smooth-talking man  
They never want to let him go  
He'll be gone when the morning comes  
Then they'll be the first to know  
  
It's just a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Well, it won't be the first  
It definitely won't be the last one you make  
Just a big mistake  
  
Sooner or later they're gonna find out  
He never cares about the hearts he's breaking tonight  
He's letting it all hang out  
The man's mighty tough  
Better leave before it starts to get too rough  
  
He such a smooth-talking man  
They never want to let him go  
He'll be gone when the morning comes  
Then they'll be the first to know  
  
It's a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Well, it won't be the first  
It definitely won't be the last one you make  
  
Such a big mistake  
Just a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
  
You might think you ought a call him Mr. Right  
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight  
You might think you ought a call him Mr. Right  
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
It's a big mistake  
You know you've been lied to  
In the morning when you know you're wrong  
Such a big mistake  
There's no one to cry to  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
It's a big mistake  
You know you've been lied to  
In the morning when you're so alone  
Such a big mistake  
When you're so alone  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
In the morning when you know you're wrong  
In the morning when you find him gone  
In the morning you'll be so alone, so alone
