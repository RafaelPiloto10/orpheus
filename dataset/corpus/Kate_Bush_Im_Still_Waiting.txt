Somewhere a door is opening  
Somewhere a door is closing  
Somewhere somebody dies  
Somewhere a newborn baby cries  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
The storm is coming back  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
'Cause I'm still waiting  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmnamm  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
Somewhere a door is opening  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
'Cause there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
There's still a heart that's beating  
Maybe the sun will come out  
They say the storm will be coming back  
Maybe you'll be coming back 'Cause I'm still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmna  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
Ooh, I'm waiting  
Mmmmmmmmoooh  
YAYAYAYAYAYA!  
Oh, I'm waiting  
Oh
