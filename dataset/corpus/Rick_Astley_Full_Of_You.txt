Cardboard boxes on the floor  
They contain memories and so much more  
Black and white photographs  
Faded now but I remember how we laughed  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
I've an empty house, full of you  
  
Pour myself a glass of wine  
Let it breathe but I don't give it too much time  
Take another and set it down  
I kid myself there's nobody else around  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
I've an empty glass, full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I can't fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
  
I hear footsteps by the door  
Could it be there's nothing else that I want more  
There you stand in front of me  
I see your face my heart has wings you set me free  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
Now my empty heart, is full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I can't fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
Let me tell you darling  
Never did I doubt you  
I can't live without you  
It's so good you're back with me
