You only hurt the one you love  
That may be true  
But better said, you only hurt the one who loves you  
  
We went through hell  
Just to get to hell  
Die of thirst of drink up form the poisoned well  
  
I kept the things inside  
At least I never lied  
I'm not trying to document my suicide  
  
You won't live long  
But you may write the perfect song  
Please excuse those who choose to not play along
