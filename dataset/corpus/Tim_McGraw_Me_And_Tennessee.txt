Baby I think we both know it's gone wrong, wrong, wrong  
And I know you don't think we can carry it on  
Baby I think we both know it's gone bad, bad, bad  
Think of all the good times we had  
Driving to your house  
Remember when we first met  
Dancin' on a Friday night  
Under the moon light  
Talkin' till the night was gone  
In the back of my truck with the radio on  
  
Then that ol' song comes on  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
When that ol' song comes on  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
That ol' country song  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Baby I think we both know  
It's alright, alright  
But how could I forget what you did that night  
Baby you told me you loved me in Tennessee  
Where we were gonna live  
But now you've done a few things that I can't forgive  
Driving to her house  
Tellin' her you love her  
Lying on a Friday night  
Ring in your pocket  
Lying to me all along  
In the back of your truck with the radio on  
  
Then that ol' song comes on  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
I know we went wrong  
But we belong  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
That ol' country song  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Then that ol song comes on  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
I know we went wrong  
But we belong  
Together we're singin'  
Forever we're singin'  
That ol country song  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
