You said we'd light the firmament  
You said our love was permanent  
You said we'd stick through thick and thin  
Through up and down, through lose and win  
But comes the first sign of stormy weather  
You're packin' your bags in the trance  
But you gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance  
  
you can't pretend it's Camelot  
Then start to run when things get hot  
When love explodes there's always heat  
There's always bitter with the sweet  
There's always times when your legs feel broken  
But you still don't drop out of the dance  
You gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance
