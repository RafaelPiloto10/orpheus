If you've been thinking you're all that you've got,  
Then don't feel alone anymore.  
When we're together, then you've got a lot,  
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore.  
And it goes on and on, oh, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.  
Winding and swirling and dancing along,  
We pass by the old willow tree  
Where lovers caress as we sing of our song,  
Twisting together when we greet the sea.  
And it goes on and on, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.  
And it goes on and on, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.
