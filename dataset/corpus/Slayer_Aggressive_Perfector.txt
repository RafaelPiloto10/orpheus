Follow me, I'll lead the way, your fears will soon overtake  
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break  
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive  
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive  
  
He'll have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
He'll satisfy your every need  
You'll never be the same  
  
Take my hand, I'll show you how,  
You've just one life to live  
The road you're on goes straight to hell,  
Your life is yours to give  
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see  
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me  
  
He'll have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
He'll satisfy your every need  
You'll never be the same
