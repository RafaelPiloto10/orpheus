Like a queen bee's honey your as sweet as can be  
I'm the king baby, buzz with me  
Dive in your hive and into your life  
Tell me little baby that you'll buzz me all the time  
  
'Cause the way we kiss just can't miss  
Don't make me wait to feel your warm embrace  
Each and every time that we get the chance  
  
Come on little baby let's make some romance  
  
Yeah you really groove me baby when you move your hips  
Shake it all around and change me pound for pound  
I want you all the time just because  
You know you really have give me a buzz
