Chorus: Regine Velasquez...  
I can live... I can love  
I can reach the heavens above...  
I can right what is wrong...  
I can sing just any song...  
I can dance... I can fly...  
And touch the rainbow in the sky...  
I can be your good friend...  
I can love you... Until the end  
  
Mikee Cojuangco:  
What took you so long to make me see...  
How lucky I am cause I am free...  
Free to do the things I wanna do...  
  
Donna Cruz:  
What took you so long to make me feel...  
I can give love...  
A love so real...  
What took you so long to let me know...  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Mikee, Donna, Regine:  
What took you so long to make me cry...  
So I would know the reason why...  
I'm so lucky I can smile... I didn't notice for a while...  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I can dance... I can fly... And touch the rainbow in the sky...  
I can be your good friend...  
I can love you... Until the end...
