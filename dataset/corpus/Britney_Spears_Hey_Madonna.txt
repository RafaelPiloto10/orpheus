I've got a madonnaI've got a big black shiny maddona  
Maybe tonight we could go for a ride  
Out on the road  
Out on the wide wide open road  
Baby lets see what we can find  
Alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets drive  
Anywhere you wanna go i will take you there babe take you there baby  
Yeah lets drive  
Anywhere your dreams go i will take you there take you there baby  
Lets drive  
  
I got a ride  
I've got a smooth slick shiny ride  
Let's open her up and lets get away  
Back out by the shore  
Top down, seats back  
Lights shinning low  
Tonight's the night we go all the way  
All the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything that you wanna find  
Is waiting for you here inside  
Lets drive  
  
I've got a car  
I've got a big black shiny car  
Maybe tonight we can go for a ride
