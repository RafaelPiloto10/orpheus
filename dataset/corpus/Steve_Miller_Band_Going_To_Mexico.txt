Pack my bags  
Don't be too slow  
I should have quit you baby  
A long time ago  
Left you flat  
And split for Mexico  
Don't try to stop me  
Child, you're talkin' too fast  
You and your friends babe  
You are a thing in my past  
You're much too slow  
I'm goin' to Mexico  
I've got four or five hundred miles to go  
Down that southbound highway  
'53 Studebaker goin' for broke  
I'm pushin' it night and day  
I've had enough of your lies  
To last a long, long time  
You and your mother, babe  
You're like a nursery rhyme  
You're much too slow  
I'm goin' to Mexico  
Yeah, come on baby  
Yeah
