I give a shit about the kick that's been coming from the underground spot  
beating the pop up, the fuck up that lays all around. Now give me sound from
the other side every night it's gonna go on and flow on and on and on and on.  
  
Mister son of a gun I got a run now. My time is over run you over like a Range
Rover. Oh my god incredible superstar, throw some lyrics make them run like a
supercar. When you know where I'm at, your fatter than fat, cause help me god
if I ain't the cool cat. Unequal, it's not even legal I'm chased by the rap
police like Bugsy Seagel.  
  
  
Baseline, baseline we've got fools on the case and their giving me baseline.
Baseline, baseline.  
Baseline, baseline we've got fools on the case and their giving me baseline.
Baseline, baseline  
  
Now we're back in the game. The Quarashi pain it's plain I see the suckers
fall out and the fuckers call out: Pick me up. But they don't know what it's
about. I do my shit on the mic and I'm pleasing the crowd. Jump back, get back
or else your getting a smack on your face just like your daddy used to smack
you way back in the days. This ain't no silly ass game I'm playing, hear what
I'm saying, now start praying  
  
  
  
What we have is breaking us down. x6
