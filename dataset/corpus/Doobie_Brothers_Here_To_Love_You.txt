I've heard it said that the weight of the world's problems  
Is enough to make the ball fall right through space  
That it ain't even worth it to live  
With all that's goin' wrong  
Well, let me just go down as saying  
That I'm glad to be here  
Here with all the same pain  
And laughs everybody knows  
Some men think they're born to be king  
Maybe that's true  
But I think passing love around  
Is all we were born to do  
Let them build their kingdoms  
Let them make the laws for this world to heed  
'Cause you and I make life worth living  
Right here in each other's arms  
I'm here to love you, baby  
No more loneliness, yeah  
No more emptiness, oh  
I'm here to love you, yeah, yeah  
Let them build their kingdoms  
Let them make the laws for this world to heed  
'Cause you and I make life worth living  
Right here in each other's arms  
I'm here to love you, baby  
No more loneliness, yeah  
No more emptiness, oh  
I'm here to love you  
I'm here to love you  
Just let me go on loving you  
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you
