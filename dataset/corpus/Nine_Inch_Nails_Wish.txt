This is the first day of my last days  
I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down  
Real far  
No need for me to stay the last thing left I just threw it away  
I put my faith in god and my trust in you  
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I'm the one without a soul I'm the one with this big fucking hole  
No new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to hell  
Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck  
Don't think you're having all the fun  
You know me I hate everyone  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I want to but I can't turn back  
But I want to
