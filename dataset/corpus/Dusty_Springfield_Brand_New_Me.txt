This is my same old coat  
And my same old shoes  
I was the same old me  
With the same old blues  
And then you touched my life  
Just by holding my hand  
And oh I look in the mirror and see  
A brand new girl, a brand new voice  
And a brand new smile  
Boy since I found you  
I've got a brand new style  
  
Just because of you boy  
Just because of you  
I've got the same old friends  
They got the same old  
I tell the same old jokes  
Get the same old grins  
Now the joke's on you  
It happened somehow with you  
Every day of my life is as fresh as morning dew  
And you know I love you boy  
  
I go to the same old places  
To see the same old faces  
Look at the same old skies  
See them all with brand new lives  
You get all the credit baby  
'Cause I love you baby
