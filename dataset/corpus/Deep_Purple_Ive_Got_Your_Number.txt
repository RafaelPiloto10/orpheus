So many signs  
So many ways  
It's a living thing  
No need to rush  
The buzz will last for days  
  
When you discover  
I'm just a man  
Take it girl  
Or leave it  
Don't be reading out the label on the can  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
I'll be your lover  
I'll be your friend  
I'll be your friend  
And your brother in love  
But that's where the story ends  
  
If you say jump  
I'll do it with affection  
But don't get pissed  
If I don't move  
Too fast in your direction  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
It's that same old nonsense  
That same old look  
But now I'm turning back  
And I can read you like a book  
It all means nothing  
Nothing at all  
It's the same old business  
Man it drives me up the wall  
  
You made the potion too strong  
I feel I'm going soft  
I've been that way far too long  
You see, now it's wearing off  
  
So many times  
So many days  
It's a spiritual thing  
That loving touch  
I thought you'd be amazed  
  
I like the distance  
I like the space  
The money's good  
The rent is cheap  
And I can read suspicion on your face  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number
