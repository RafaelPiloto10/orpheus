It took one look  
And forever laid out in front of me  
One smile and I died  
Only to be revived by you  
  
There I was  
Thought I had everything figured out  
Goes to show just how much I know  
'Bout the way life plays out...  
  
Chorus:  
I take one step away  
Then I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only, one and only you... Ooh...  
  
Now I know  
That I know not a thing at all  
Except the fact that I am yours  
And that you are mine  
  
Ooh  
They told me that this wouldn't be easy  
And no  
I'm not one to complain...  
  
Chorusx2:  
I take one step away  
When I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only, one and only you... Ooh...
