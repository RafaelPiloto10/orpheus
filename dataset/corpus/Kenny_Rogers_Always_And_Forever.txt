Always and forever, each moment with you  
It's just like a dream to me that somehow came true  
And I know tomorrow will still be the same  
Cos we got a life of love that won't ever change.  
  
Every day lend me your own special way  
Melt my heart away with a smile  
Take time to tell me you really care  
And we'll share tomorrow together.  
  
There's always be sunshine when I look at you  
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do  
If you get lonely, call me and take  
A second to give to me the magic you make.  
  
Every day ...  
I'll always love you .....forever  
Every day ....  
Baby, baby, baby, I'll love you forever  
I'll always love you forever  
Together, forever.
