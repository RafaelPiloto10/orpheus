Through these misty eyes  
I see lonely skies  
Lonely road to Babylon  
  
Where's my family  
And my country  
Heaven knows where I belong  
  
Pack my bags tonight  
Here's one Jacobite  
Who must leave or surely die  
  
Put me on a train  
In the pouring rain  
Say farewell but don't say goodbye  
  
Seagull carry me, over land and sea  
To my own folk, that's where I want to be  
Every beat of my heart  
Tears me further apart  
I'm lost and alone in the dark  
I'm going home  
  
One more glass of wine  
Just for auld lang syne  
And the girl I left behind  
  
How I miss her now  
In my darkest hour  
And the way our arms entwine  
  
Seagull carry me, over land and sea  
To my own folk, that's where I want to be  
Every beat of my heart  
Tears me further apart  
I'm lost and alone in the dark  
I'm going home  
  
And we'll drink a toast  
To the blood red rose  
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle  
  
And to the northern lights  
And the swirling pipes  
How they make a grown man cry  
  
Seagull carry me, over land and sea  
To my own folk, that's where I want to be  
Every beat of my heart  
Tears me further apart  
I'm lost and alone in the dark  
I'm going home  
  
Every beat of my heart  
Tears me further apart  
I'm lost and alone in the dark  
I'm going home
