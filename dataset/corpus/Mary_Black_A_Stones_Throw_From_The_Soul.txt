Love showed me it's riches late last spring  
Took me to it's breast and gave me wings  
I truly did believe  
And still I was deceived  
Love made me it's witness one fine spring  
  
Life seemed dark and beautiful at once  
All mixed upside down and back to front  
It was hard to know what's what  
The light went on and off  
Life was stark and plentiful at once  
  
Maybe time really does heal wounds  
Maybe love doesn't know  
A mere heartbeat from happiness  
A stone's throw from the soul  
  
Days lived with a will  
Days as fine as can be  
Days grace on my morning pillow  
Days I'm longing to see  
  
Sunlight blows the winter one last kiss  
Me I hold my breath and make my wish  
We live through thick and thin  
Where evil sometimes wins  
Me I try my best and think of this  
  
That maybe time really does heal wounds  
And maybe love doesn't know  
A mere heartbeat from happiness  
A stone's throw from the sould
