By a fountain back in Rome I fell in love with you  
In a small cafe in Athens You said you loved me too  
And it was April in Paris when I first held you close to me  
Rome, Georgia, Athens, Texas And Paris, Tennessee  
  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
There's no Riviera  
In Festus, Missouri  
  
And you won't find Onassis  
In Mullinville, Kansas  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
Our steak and martinis  
Is draft beer with weenies  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
The Prine and DeMent set  
Ain't the flaming suzette set  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love
