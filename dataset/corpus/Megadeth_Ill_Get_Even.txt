I'm lonely and abandoned  
Washed up, left for dead  
I'm lost inside the desert  
Of every word you said  
Like a nuclear reactor  
Or TNT  
I'm thinking about the times  
When you lied to me  
All the innuendo  
Caught up on your hook  
I was just a name  
In your little black book  
Ah, I'll get even with you  
I'm bitter and I'm twisted  
I haven't slept in days  
I'm lonely and I'm angry  
I can't make it go away  
I'm like a bomb that's ticking  
I got voices in my head  
I got a doll with needles in  
Wishing you were dead  
I'll get you back somehow  
That's what I'm gonna do  
I'll get you back somehow  
Your nightmare coming true  
Ah, I'll get even with you  
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do  
Gonna get even with you  
You better look behind you  
'Cause there I'm gonna be  
I'll be standing in the shadows  
With who I used to be  
He's slightly schizophrenic  
Me and me and me and me agree  
That you are gonna pay  
For what you did to me  
Ah, I'll get even with you  
Gonna get even with you  
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna...  
Ah, I'll get even with you
