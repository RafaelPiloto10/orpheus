Just a perfect day  
Drink Sangria in the park  
And then later  
When it gets dark, we go home  
  
Just a perfect day  
Feed animals in the zoo  
Then later  
A movie, too, and then home  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
Just a perfect day  
Problems all left alone  
Weekenders on our own  
It's such fun  
  
Just a perfect day  
You made me forget myself  
I thought I was  
Someone else, someone good  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow
