Say you know you've got to run  
You know you've got to hide  
You don't know who to follow  
Or who is on your side  
You don't know where you're goin'  
You won't talk of where you've been  
And I may see you tomorrow  
Or nevermore again.  
  
And I've seen you in the cities  
I've seen you on the road  
And your face is all a-twisted  
'cause your brain is a heavy load  
And then you turn and ask me  
Say how will I ever know  
And you talk of all your searchin'  
But I think it's all for show  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on, let her in  
Open up again.  
  
And I hear your mournful songs  
I hear your painful crys  
And I've seen the light of hunger  
Linger deep within your eyes  
And you talk about your sinkin'  
And what a hole you're in  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself my friend.  
  
And you've got yourself a potion  
Oh to keep you from your sleep  
In that dark and lonely hour  
Well I've heard you laugh and weep  
But you'll always be a-runnin'  
Runnin' till you find your doom  
'Cause you never face your lonely soul  
You never face the gloom.  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on, let her in  
Open up again.
