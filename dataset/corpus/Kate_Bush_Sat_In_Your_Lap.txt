I see the people working,  
And see it working for them.  
And so I want to join in,  
But then I find it hurts me.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have.  
  
I see the people happy,  
So can it happen for me?  
'Cause when I am unhappy,  
There's nothing that can move me.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have.  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.  
Some say that heaven is hell.  
Some say that hell is heaven.  
  
I must admit, just when I think I'm king,  
(I just begin.)  
Just when I think I'm king, I must admit,  
(I just begin.)  
Just when I think I'm king,  
(I just begin.)  
  
I've been doing it for years.  
My goal is moving near.  
It says, "Look! I'm over here."  
Then it up and disappears.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.  
Some say that knowledge is ho-ho-ho-ho.  
  
I want to be a lawyer.  
I want to be a scholar.  
But I really can't be bothered.  
Ooh, just gimme it quick, gimme it, gimme gimme gimme gimme!  
  
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho.  
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho.  
Some say that heaven is hell.  
Some say that hell is heaven.  
  
I must admit, just when I think I'm king,  
(I just begin.)  
Just when I think I'm king, I must admit,  
(I just begin.)  
Just when I think everything's going great,  
(I just begin,)  
Hey, I get the break,  
Hey, I'm gonna take it all--  
(I just begin.)  
When I'm king--  
(-- just begin.)  
  
In my dome of ivory,  
A home of activity,  
I want the answers quickly,  
But I don't have no energy.  
  
I hold a cup of wisdom,  
But there is nothing within.  
My cup, she never overfloweth,  
And 'tis I that moan- and groaneth.  
  
Some grey and white matter,  
"Give me the karma, mama!"  
I'm coming up the ladder,  
"A jet to Mecca,"  
I'm coming up the ladder,  
"Tibet or Jeddah,  
Up the ladder...  
"To Salisbury,  
A monastery,  
The longest journey,  
Across the desert,  
Across the weather,  
Across the elements,  
Across the water!"
