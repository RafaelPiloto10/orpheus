There's a black wind blowing  
A typhoon on the rise  
Pummelin' rain  
Murderous skies!  
I'm gonna take my books  
I'm gonna wear my coat  
I'm gonna find my scarf  
And wrap it around my throat  
And you can  
Come with me  
Through the drivin' snow  
We're gonna ride on up to  
Medicine Bow  
Well I spent too long  
Just stuck on the shore  
There's a man in my head  
But he isn't me any more  
I'm gonna find me a ship  
Stowaway on a boat  
I'm gonna burn all the words  
And letters and cards that I ever wrote  
And you can  
Sail with me  
Where the current flows  
We're gonna move on up to  
Medicine Bow  
I'm gonna change my colors  
Cancel my things  
Stop my squawkin'  
Grow some wings!  
Well I will not sleep  
And I will not rest  
I will put my soul  
And my will to the test  
I'm gonna tug at my tether  
I'm gonna tear on my lead  
I'm gonna test my knowledge  
In the field of deeds  
And you can  
Run with me  
Fast as we can go  
Over the hills to  
Medicine Bow
