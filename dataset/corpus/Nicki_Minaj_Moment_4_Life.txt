I fly with the stars in the skies,  
I am no longer trying to survive,  
I believe that life is a prize,  
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,  
Don't worry bout me and who I fire  
I get what I desire it's my empire  
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire  
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire  
In this very moment I'm king  
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,  
This very moment I bring  
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,  
And I will retire with the crown, yes!  
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes!  
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me!  
But I couldn't do it all alone, we!  
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley  
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy  
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me  
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't phase me  
Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done  
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know, this night just remind me of  
Everything that they deprived me of  
Put ya drinks up,  
It's a celebration every time we link up  
We done did everything they can think of  
Greatness is what we on the brink of  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive (yeah, yeah, yeah uh)  
  
What I tell 'em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees  
Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil' Cease  
I'm in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz  
Doin' target practice all these bitches just aiming to please  
Shout out to the C.E.O. five hundred degrees  
Shout out to the O.V.O wear rings and fatigues, ow!  
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental  
This supposed to be ya'll year we ain't get the memo  
A young King, pay me in gold  
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled  
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold  
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!  
Yeah, be very afraid  
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away  
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today  
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh  
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five  
Are we drinking a lil' more I can hardly decide  
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear  
Damn, this one for the books, man!  
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!  
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is,  
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah!  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life  
  
This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell its time  
Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life
