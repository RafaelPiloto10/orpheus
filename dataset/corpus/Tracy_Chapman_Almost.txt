Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One green light  
One more ring of the telephone  
One more step  
One more second  
And I almost  
Almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One hello  
Just one kiss before the tears come  
One yes  
One chance  
And I almost  
Almost almost almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One day one year  
5,000 weeks  
A life of good works and good deeds  
Let me be let me be closer  
Or let me be  
Let me be  
Let me be  
  
When I've almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One good guess  
A question with an answer that I know  
One idea  
One grand notion  
And I almost  
Almost almost almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
Never does  
Never does
