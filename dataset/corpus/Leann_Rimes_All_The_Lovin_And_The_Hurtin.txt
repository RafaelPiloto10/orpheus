Do you ever get past the pain you go through?  
When you give all you can and you can't understand  
Why a dream won't come true?  
  
It's one sided romance you can't undo  
When you do all the loving and hurting, too  
You can't take it back once you give your heart  
Trying not to recall how you did all is the hardest part  
  
And you can't change the reason you feel like a fool  
'Cause you did all the loving and hurting, too  
  
That's the price you pay for doing more than your share  
When you love enough for both of you, no one else has to care  
And though it's all over, you look back on the truth  
You did all the lovin' and the hurting, too  
  
And though it's all over, it's over for you  
You're still doing all the lovin' and the hurting, too  
You did all the lovin' and the hurting, too
