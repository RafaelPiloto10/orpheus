Sometimes I feel I've been hung on a line,  
Wasting my time,  
Sometimes I feel I've been hung upside down,  
You turned me around just a fool about you.  
  
Sometimes I feel I've been left on the moon,  
Fed with a spoon,  
Sometimes I feel like a dog with no bone,  
Or a toad with no stone, just a fool about you.  
  
Sometimes I feel like saying goodbye,  
Cause I'm living a lie,  
Sometimes I feel like a clock with no time,  
Or a verse with no rhyme, just a fool about you.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a bird with no wing,  
Or a bee with no sting,  
Sometimes I feel like a train with no line,  
Or a glass with no wine, just a fool about you.  
  
Everybody knows I'm a fool about you  
Just a fool just a crazy fool,  
Everybody knows I can't live without you,  
So what am I gonna to do.
