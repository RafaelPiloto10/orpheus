And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom  
And I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard  
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on  
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain  
I'll wake up in Strawberry Fields every day  
And the atrocities of school I can forgive  
The happy phantom has no right to bitch  
  
Oo who  
The time is getting closer  
Oo who  
Time to be a ghost  
Oo who  
Every day we're getting closer  
The sun is getting dim  
Will we pay for who we been  
  
So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom  
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jewel  
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera  
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand  
And then these seven little men get up to dance  
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen  
I'm still an angel to a girl who hates to sin  
  
Oo who...  
  
Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back  
You found a girl that you could truly love again  
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep  
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see  
  
Oo who...
