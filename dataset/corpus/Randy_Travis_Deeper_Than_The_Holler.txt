Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love  
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above  
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all  
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall  
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you  
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill  
  
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between  
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing  
And everyone is different and everyone's the same  
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill
