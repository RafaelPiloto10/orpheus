I'm dreaming of a white christmas,  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white christmas,  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white christmas,  
With every christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright,  
And may all your christmases be white
