When You found me  
My whole world changed  
I'm redeemed by Your life  
  
Let the earth see  
You are freedom  
Turn my darkness to light  
  
You welcome me in  
With open arms  
Into unending light  
  
I'm not ashamed of the gospel Lord  
Your power, your love  
You saved my soul  
Now I'm alive in You  
I live in the risen Son
