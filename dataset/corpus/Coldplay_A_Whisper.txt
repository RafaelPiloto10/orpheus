A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper  
A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Night turns to day  
And I still have these questions  
Bridges will break  
Should I go forwards or backwards  
Night turns to day  
And I still get no answers  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
(Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper)  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And I am just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah
