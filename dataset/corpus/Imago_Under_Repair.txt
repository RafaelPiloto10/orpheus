La La La La...  
La La La La...  
  
I understand you feel that I get tired of looking after you  
You even start to think that I've been meaning  
To do this to you  
If you only knew how much of me wants to tell you  
All this passes...  
  
Take your time, reconsider (til I find my place in you)  
Take your time to let your ache go away.  
  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
  
La La La La...  
La La La La...  
  
Sick and tired of taking the mellow beating of the  
Stupid games we play.  
We run around but I'm done needing this hurt  
I've stayed too long but I'm taking you with me  
You're too beautiful to be seen here  
  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
No harm done, you're under repair.  
  
La La La La...  
La La La La...
