You're much too young  
To be a part of me  
Too young  
To get a hold on me  
  
You're much too young  
You're much too young  
You're much too young  
To mess around with me  
  
Hey  
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks  
But I've never met a girl with all her own teeth  
That's why I love you babe  
That's why we could be  
But you're too young  
Too young  
  
The past doesn't matter [Repeat x12]  
  
Hey  
Sophisticated lady  
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks  
But you've got style  
You've got class  
But most of all  
You've got love technique.
