Glory Lord Jesus, glory to your Holy Name.  
Glory Lord Jesus, your blood,  
It has removed my shame.  
When the Son of Man returns,  
Will He find faith on the Earth?  
Well I hope so, I want to be found ready.  
  
Holy, Lord Jesus, holy is your righteous throne.  
Holy, Lord Jesus, my praises go to you alone.  
Worthy art thou Lord our God,  
To receive all glory honor and power,  
For there is none beside thee.  
  
Faith is believin', faith is for overcoming.  
And if I'm going to love you.  
I sure got to trust you.
