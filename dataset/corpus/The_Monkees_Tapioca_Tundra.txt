Reasoned verse some prose or rhyme  
Lose themselves in other times  
And waiting hopes cast silent spells  
That speak in clouded clues  
It cannot be a part of me  
For now it's part of you  
Sunshine, rag time, blowing in the breeze  
  
Midnight looks right standing more at ease  
Silhouettes and figures stay  
Close to what he had to say  
And one more time the faded dream  
Is saddened by the news  
It cannot be a part of me  
For not it's a part of you
