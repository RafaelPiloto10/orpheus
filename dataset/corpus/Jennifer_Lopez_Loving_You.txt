Would you mind  
If I took the time to get to know you  
Cause its been a while since all we been through  
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change  
Nothing stays the same, oh  
I can see  
When I look in your eyes you mean no harm  
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm  
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong  
And there ain't nothin' wrong with me still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had  
We just need to take it slow  
  
In the past  
You would act as if you don't really care  
You fight and argue almost anywhere  
Lookin' back sometimes I feel like such a fool  
For putting up with you oh  
Baby please, understand if it seems I'm confused  
Its just that it might take me  
Some time to get used to you  
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby  
I just find myself still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had, baby  
We just need to take it slow  
  
I believe you and me had a chance to make this right  
Oh baby if your heart is in it  
I'm still with it  
Even after all of this time has passed  
Oh I'm still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through, yea  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had, baby  
We just need to take it slow  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing, never give up  
Never gave up on the love we had, love we had  
We just need to take it slow
