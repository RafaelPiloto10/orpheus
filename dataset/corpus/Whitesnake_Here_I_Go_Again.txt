I don't know where I'm goin'  
But I sure know where I've been  
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
Here I go again, here I go again  
  
Tho' I keep searching for an answer  
I never seem to find what I'm looking for  
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
  
Just another heart in need of rescue  
Waiting on love's sweet charity  
An' I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
And here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
But here I go again, here I go again,  
Here I go again, here I go  
  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
