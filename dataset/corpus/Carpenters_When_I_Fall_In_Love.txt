Maybe I'm old fashioned feeling as I do  
Maybe I'm just living in the part  
But when I meet the right one, I know I'll be true  
My first love will be my last  
When I fall in love, it will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before it's begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
When I give me heart, it will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
And the moment I can fell that you fell that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you
