Well I see the souls of so many friends  
And I see us all back here again  
With sandy floors and ceiling fans  
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs  
That fill my memories like a tip jar  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
I see tourists at Christmas time  
And I taste beers with a hint of lime  
I feel lonely 'cause it's not the same  
Different faces and different names  
Living like pirates out among the stars  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
And I see a kid coming into his own  
And a man learning to move on  
Somehow trying to find his way  
A dreamer betting on blind faith  
Chasing that sun and following his heart  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
A few have moved on back to Maine  
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne  
Some are still living the dream  
Stuck in still life it seems  
No matter where they've been  
Or where they are  
Yeah, I see 'em here  
When I see this bar  
When I see this bar  
  
I wonder where we go from here  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
Life ain't over but it's always near  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
I think about all the good times that we had  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
Makes me happy and it makes me sad  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
How could we be so close, now so far apart  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
That's what I feel, that's what I see  
Yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars  
That's what I see when I see this bar  
  
That's what I see when I see this bar
