You must be dreamin'  
Or going out of your mind  
There's no way of changin'  
The world over one night  
  
Baby you need to recover  
From all the things you've been through  
Baby you need to discover  
There ain't much to do but  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
The wings of tomorrow  
Ride, ride, ride  
To change the world  
  
You feel sorry for the nations of 1984  
And it cuts you like a razor  
Cause you've seen it all before  
  
You've seen one war after another  
So many lives on the line  
You must take care of one another  
Or reach the end of time  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
The wings of tomorrow  
Ride, ride, ride  
To change the world
