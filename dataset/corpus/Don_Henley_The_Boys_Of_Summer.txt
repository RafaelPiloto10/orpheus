Nobody on the road,  
Nobody on the beach.  
I feel it in the air,  
The summer's out of reach.  
Empty lake, empty streets,  
The sun goes down alone.  
I'm driving by your house  
Don't know you're not home.  
  
But I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got your hair combed back  
And your sunglasses on, baby.  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I never will forget those nights.  
I wonder if it was a dream.  
Remember how you made me crazy,  
Remember how I made you scream.  
I don't understand what happened to our love.  
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
I see you walking real slow  
And you're smiling at everyone.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.  
A little voice inside my head said:  
"Don't look back, you can never look back."  
I thought I knew what love was.  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that top pulled down,  
And that radio on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that hair slicked back,  
And those Wayfarers on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.
