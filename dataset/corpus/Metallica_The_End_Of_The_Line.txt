Need  
More and more  
Tainted misery  
  
Bleed  
Battle scars  
Chemical affinity  
  
Reign  
Legacy  
Innocence corrode  
  
Stain  
Rot away  
Catatonic overload  
  
Choke  
Asphyxia  
Snuff reality  
  
Scorch  
Kill the light  
Incinerate celebrity  
  
Reaper  
Butchery  
Karma amputee  
  
Bloodline  
Breeding fine  
Death contagious deity  
  
Hooked into this deceiver  
Need more and more  
Into the endless fever  
Need more and more  
  
New consequence machine  
Burn through all your gasoline  
Asylum overtime  
Never mind  
You reach the end of the line  
  
Time  
Choke the clock  
Steal another day  
  
Die  
Faithfully  
Narcissistic fade away  
  
Twisted  
Jump the rail  
Shout at the crowd below  
  
Breaker  
Chase the ghost  
The latest high to all time low  
  
Hooked into this deceiver  
Need more and more  
Into the endless fever  
Need more and more  
  
New consequence machine  
Burn through all your gasoline  
Asylum overtime  
Never mind  
You reach the end of the line  
  
Drop the hourglass of time  
Spinning sand we will not find  
As we gather here today  
We bid farewell  
  
The slave becomes the master  
The slave becomes the master  
The slave becomes the master  
The slave becomes the master  
  
Need more and more  
Right now and ever after  
Need more and more  
  
New consequence machine  
Burn through all your gasoline  
Asylum overtime  
Never mind  
  
Dead hourglass of time  
Sand we will not ever find  
We gather here today  
Say goodbye  
'Cause you've reached the end of the line  
  
The end of the line  
The end of the line  
The end of the line  
You've reached the end of the line
