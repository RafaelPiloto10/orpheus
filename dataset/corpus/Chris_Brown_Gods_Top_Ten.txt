(written by Andrew Farriss)  
(feat. Suzie Mcneil)  
  
Romance is gone, he's drifting with the stars  
The lyric in his pocket, little girl in his heart  
When you hear his songs on the radio I don't need to tell you what you already
know  
He's in God's top ten where heaven never ends  
  
You saw the world and the world saw you on the stage  
Wild, wild, wild, Colonial Boy  
Roquefort le Pont  
Your gypsy heart is free, pictures on the wall of your family  
He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten  
  
Baby's got mama's eyes, she was always beautiful  
When you hear his voice, feel his arms around you  
You remember mama's smile and daddy's little girl  
Bad weather, cold media storm  
He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten
