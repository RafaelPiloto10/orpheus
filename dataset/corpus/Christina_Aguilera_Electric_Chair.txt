Where I've been all my life...  
  
The dress is Chanel  
The shoes ysl  
The bag is Dior  
Agent Provocateur  
My address today, la by the way  
Above Sunset Strip, the hills all the way  
  
My rings are by Webster  
It makes the heads twirl  
They all say, "Darling, what did you do for those pearls?"  
"What"! I am a good girl The age I adore, the day oh no more  
Breakfast Polo Launch and pools at the shore  
The Chateau for cocktails  
The Courtyard at night  
Downtown is for dinner  
The hell is divine  
You know I have found the words goin' round  
They all say my feet never do touch the ground  
"What"! I am a good girl...
