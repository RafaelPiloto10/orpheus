I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine  
I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line  
But times were hard, and though I tried, the money wasn't there  
And bankers came and took my land, and told me "fair is fair".  
  
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no  
"Hire you now," they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"  
The government they promised me a measly little sum  
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum  
  
Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,  
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
You'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large  
But just the other day I saw an unsuspecting barge  
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser  
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.  
  
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river  
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver  
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is waiting in the bay,  
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
Well, Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat  
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,  
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job  
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.  
  
A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,  
I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T. (Screw it!)  
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, the terror of the sea  
If you want to reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here  
I heard that in Alberta there's a band of buccaneers  
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay  
And you're bound to lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way  
  
Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze  
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze  
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've got to go  
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
