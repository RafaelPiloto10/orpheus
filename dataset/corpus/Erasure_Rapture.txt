Toe to toe, dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotized  
And they're stepping lightly  
  
Hang each night in rapture  
Back to back, sacroiliac  
Spineless movement and a wild attack  
Face to face sightless solitude  
  
And it's finger popping  
Twenty- four hour shopping in rapture  
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly  
DJ spinning I said "My My"  
  
Flash is fast flash is cool  
'Francois c'est pas flashe non due'  
  
And you don't stop sure shot  
Go out to the parking lot  
And you get in your car and drive real far  
And you drive all night and then you see a light  
  
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground  
And out comes a man from Mars  
And you try to run but he's got a gun  
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head  
  
And then you're in the man from Mars  
You go out at night eating cars  
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too  
Mercury's and Subaru  
  
And you don't stop  
You keep on eating cars  
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night  
And eat up bars where the people meet  
  
Face to face  
Dance cheek to cheek  
One to one  
Man to man  
  
Dance toe to toe  
Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars  
He's eating bars  
Yeah wall to wall  
  
Door to door  
Hall to hall  
He's gonna eat 'em all  
Rapture  
Be pure  
  
Take a tour through the sewer  
Don't strain your brain  
Paint a train  
You'll be singing in the rain  
  
Said don't stop to the punk rock  
Toe to toe, dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotised  
  
And they're stepping lightly  
Hang each night in rapture  
Well now you see what you want to be  
Just have your party on TV  
  
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on  
And now he's gone back up to space  
Where he won't have the hassle with the human race  
And you hip hop  
And you don't stop  
  
Just blast off  
Sure shot  
Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars  
And eating bars  
And now he only eats guitars  
  
Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Rapture  
Rapture  
Rapture
