Wish someone would  
Write me a song  
Or tell me a story  
So I don't need to worry  
I need a little love  
And a hand to hold  
Somebody old  
To watch over me  
I need a little time  
So I don't have to hurry  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
But  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta wake up  
To the situation  
  
I wish someone  
Would answer  
The phone  
Stop leaving me  
Hanging on  
I'm feeling  
Like a little ship  
Out on the ocean  
I need a little love  
And a hand to hold  
Somewhere  
To hold the frustration  
I need a little cause  
For celebration  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta wake up  
To the situation  
  
Growing up  
Checking notes  
So you know  
Just  
Just which way to go  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x4]  
You've just gotta  
You've just gotta  
You've gotta  
You've just gotta  
You've gotta gotta  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up
