There's too much light in this room  
But soon the moon will be gone from view  
There's too much fight 'til we bruise  
One step from saying goodbye to you  
  
And maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out  
Maybe it's the darkness all around, all around  
Tore this love apart, what happens now?  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late if I stay?  
  
My bags are packed in a row  
Don't think I'm ready to let you go now  
This hurts me more than you know  
The sound of silence before the showdown  
  
Maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out  
Maybe it's the darkness all around, all around  
Tear this love apart or stand my ground?  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late?  
  
If I stay right here, hold you forever  
For a thousand years, for worse or for better  
We can't stop now, we'll make it together someway  
If I stay, ooh if I stay  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late if I stay?
