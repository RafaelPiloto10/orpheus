I need Thee every hour,  
Most gracious Lord.  
No tender voice like thine,  
Can peace afford.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
Stay thou nearby.  
Temptations lose their pow'are  
When thou are nigh.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
In joy or pain.  
Come quickly and abide,  
Or life is vain.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
Most holy One.  
Oh, make me thine indeed,  
Thou blessed Son!  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!
