Sunset on the highway to old mexico  
Ruby like the wind upon my face  
Thunder from a storm on the horizon far away  
Ruby cut directly to the chase  
She said,  
"anywhere you're going baby  
You just gotta know I'm on your side. (I always was)  
When you climb upon the stallion  
You are bound to let him take you for a ride  
All the way."  
Chorus:  
I know I'm still wild enough for you  
And you know you, you can always count on me  
Baby, we used to be worth fighting for  
So tell me, are we?  
Anything like anything we used to be  
Or tried to make believe before the fall?  
Tell me how the hell you keep your spirit (remember spirit? )  
Strong enough to answer to the call  
Ruby closed her eyes and faced the heavens  
She said, "take me to the stars one more time"  
I was doin' eighty, but I pushed her through the floor  
And watched her climb  
Outta sight, outta mind  
Chorus:  
I know I'm still wild enough for you  
And you know you, you can always count on me  
Baby, we used to be worth fighting for  
So tell me, are we?
