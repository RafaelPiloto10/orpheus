Nothing I can say  
Can make your picture talk  
I feel so tired and  
Nothing I can do  
Will make your picture move  
I feel so helpless but  
I can feel  
A child with the ghost here  
You let your heart slip away  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever  
I wonder  
If God is all they say  
I can't believe in such things.  
I suppose  
Some games are hard to lose  
But you don't have to play 'cause  
I can feel  
A child with the ghost here  
You let your heart slip away  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever  
Sometimes my mind remembers  
Sometimes my mind remembers  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever
