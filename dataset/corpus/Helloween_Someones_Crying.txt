What keeps on telling me to stay on the way I chose  
What keeps on giving me all the strength to carry on  
  
Give me some time, can't sleep anymore at night  
I want to show I'm here with an aim of mine  
  
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know  
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go  
  
Don't need to stone my brain, I need my head for something else  
I want to live and learn, step by step I'm going on  
  
Send me a sign, don't want to resign too soon  
What situation will come I can't endure
