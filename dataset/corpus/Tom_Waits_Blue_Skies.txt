Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
  
Ain't got no money, cupboards are bare  
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear  
She walked out without a word  
Now the only sound left is the morning bird  
singing ...  
  
Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
  
Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
Give me another woman to take her place
