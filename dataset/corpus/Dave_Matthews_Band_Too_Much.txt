Straight in, suck up and go,  
Cool it swallow, swallow  
Oo Breathe deep, take it all it comes cheap  
Push it through the doors  
'Cause in between the lines  
I'm gonna pack more lines  
So I can get down in  
  
Ooh traffic jam got more cars  
Than a beach got sand  
Suck it up, suck it up,  
Zip suck it up,  
Fill it up 'til no more  
I'm no crazy creep, I've got it coming  
To me 'cause I'm not satisfied  
The hunger keeps on growing  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
I've got to get it somewhere  
I mean, you never know, maybe  
You're dreaming  
Who do you think you're watching  
Who do you think you need  
Play for me, play more,  
Ten times in the same day  
I need more, I'm going  
Over my borders  
I'm going to take more, more  
From you, letter by letter  
  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
I told, god, I'm coming  
To your country  
I'm going to eat up your cities,  
Your homes, you know  
I've got a stomach full it's not  
A chip on my shoulder  
I've got this growl in my tummy  
And I'm gonna stop it today  
  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
Suck it up...
