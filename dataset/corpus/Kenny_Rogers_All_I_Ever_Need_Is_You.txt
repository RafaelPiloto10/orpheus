Sometimes when I'm down and alone  
I feel just like a child with out a home  
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey  
All I ever need is you  
  
Your my first love, your my last  
Your my future, your my past  
Oh loving you is all I ask, honey  
All I ever need is you  
  
Winters come and then they go  
And we watch the melting snow  
Sure summer follows spring, all the things you do  
Give me a reason to build my world around you  
  
Some men follow rainbows I am told  
Some men search for silver, some for gold  
But I found my treasures in my soul  
And all I ever need is you  
  
Without love I'd never find the way  
Through ups and downs of every single day  
And I won't sleep at night until you say  
Honey, all I ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La  
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on  
Honey, all I'll ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La  
But I found my treasures in my soul  
Honey, and all I ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La
