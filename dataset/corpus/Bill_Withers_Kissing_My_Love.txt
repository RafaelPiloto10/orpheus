Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Yeah thump a thumping in my head  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
I close my eyes and see a pretty city  
With a million flowers babe  
  
Now I can hear the angels sing  
Songs that only angels sing  
She's such a pretty thing  
That I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
She's such a tender sender  
With her sweet young friends  
  
She's so good at what she does  
All she wants to do is kiss and hug  
She's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
[Repeat x8]  
Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot,  
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
She's such a tender sender  
With her sweet young friends  
  
Whoa now  
  
She's so good at what she does  
All she wants to do is kiss and hug  
She's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love
