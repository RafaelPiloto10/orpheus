Can't tell you how many times I've wanted to hold you  
Can't tell you how many dreams how many fantasies  
As I count down the hours and I count down the seconds  
Will I be able to say will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman  
Sometimes I wonder if this love will ever find expression  
Does a seed in winters arms know of springs intention  
Two spirits dancing through a body conversation  
Is this light years away will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman
