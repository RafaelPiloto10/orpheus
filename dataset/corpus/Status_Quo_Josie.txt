In view of the fact that there's a rumour going round  
I feel that I'd better state my case  
I'd like to clear up the misunderstandings that surround  
Our latest excursions into space  
  
Why, you may ask, do I still try  
And penetrate beyond the endless sky  
Up high  
  
Let me look into your eyes Josie  
Count the stars along the Milky Way  
I won't leave you, not tonight Josie  
If you'll try to love me, try to love me  
Show me you do  
The way that I love you  
  
In spite of the difficulties met with at the start  
The probe will be carried out as planned  
The problem is now the big question of the human heart  
And what kind of stress it can withstand  
  
Where, you may ask, will all this end?  
Well I can't say I really comprehend.  
  
Let me look into your eyes Josie  
Count the stars along the Milky Way  
I won't leave you, not tonight Josie  
If you'll try to love me, try to love me  
Show me you do  
The way that I love you  
  
When I look into your eyes Josie  
The world of man is very far away  
Stay with me and let me hear you say  
That you'll try to love me, try to love me  
Show me you do  
The way that I love you
