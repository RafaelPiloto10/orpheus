Well, they say that I'm too country, the way I look and sound.  
They wanna to make me over, just a little more uptown.  
Say I need to change my image, now tell me what's that mean.  
Don't they know I've got country in my genes?  
  
Well, I can't help the way I talk, I wouldn't change it if I could.  
Sophisticated ain't my style, but country fits me good.  
I ain't ashamed to wear what's been handed down to me.  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.  
  
I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.  
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.  
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.  
I'm just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing.  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.  
  
Oh that Earl Scruggs.  
  
If country's hit the big time, me, I'm still the same.  
I ain't above my raisin' and I ain't about to change.  
I wouldn't trade my Wranglers for the finest gaberdine.  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.  
  
I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.  
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.  
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.  
I'm just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing.  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.  
  
I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.  
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.  
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.  
I'm an old Kentucky hillybilly with a country song to sing.  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.  
  
Lord, I've got country in my genes.
