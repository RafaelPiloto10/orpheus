It's getting dark outside  
Daytime is done.  
The lights along the river come up  
One by one.  
Let's make love again  
We got time.  
I am yours  
You are mine.  
It's getting dark outside  
I have to go.  
Don't want my husband  
Or my friends to know.  
Zip up my dress  
  
I can't find my shoes.  
Don't fall in love with me  
Too much to lose.  
The kids are home by now  
Have to think fast.  
I really think this afternoon  
Must be the last.  
Don't say anything,  
Don't turn on the light.  
Thanks for loving me,  
Call you tonight.
