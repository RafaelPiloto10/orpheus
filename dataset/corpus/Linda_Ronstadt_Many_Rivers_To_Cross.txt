Many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way over  
Wandering I am lost  
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover  
  
Many rivers to cross  
And it's only my will that keeps me alive  
I've been licked, washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride  
  
And this loneliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be on your own  
My baby left me and he didn't say why  
Well I guess I'll have to try  
  
Many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin  
I'm playing for time  
There have been times I find myself thinking of committing  
Some dreadful crime  
  
I've got many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way over  
Wandering I am lost  
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover
