Suve, suve, hasta la nube, balante ante, no mire patra  
I hit the jack pot ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ching  
Real chico's do real things on the road to the riches  
Skip diamond rings  
Moved up from the streets graduated hustla'  
On his way to an entrepreneur  
Undefeated Don shooter  
Now baby save me from the game before it plays me  
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese  
I can care less if you love me or hate me  
Life's a bitch,  
Now fuck you pay me  
  
Suve, suve, hasta la nube, balante ante, no mire patra  
  
Ooh, oh, oh

Lose my money honey, now pay me what you owe me  
Mommis a hurricane you should see the way she blow it  
I don't make it rain I speak that global warming  
This ain't no biggy, ready to die number five there is no warning  
Now baby save me from the game before it plays me  
My life's a movie call me Martin Scorsese  
I can care less if you love me or hate me  
Life's a bitch,
