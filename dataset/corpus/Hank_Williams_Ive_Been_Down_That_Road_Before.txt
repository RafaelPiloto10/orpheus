Now friends if you'll just listen to me  
You'll get some good hard earned advice  
I don't aim to meddle in your business  
Just trying to save ya an awful price  
  
You see these teeth that I ain't got  
And these knots on my bald head  
I'll guaranty you boys I didn't get um'  
There a lying home in bed  
  
Now take the smart-aleck in any town  
Of him folks want no part  
He acts like his head was only  
Made to hold his ears apart  
  
Now he might not like what  
I'm bout to say and my words  
Might make him sore  
But I'm just trying to be helpful  
Cause I been down that road before  
  
To bully folks and play mean tricks  
Was once my pride and joy  
Till one day I was toted home  
And mama didn't know her little boy  
  
My head was swelled up so doggone big  
I couldn't get it through my front door  
Now I ain't talking just ta hear myself  
I been down that road before  
  
A little fella about my size  
Got tired of being pushed about  
So he went to work and when he got through  
He'd knocked everyone of my teeth out  
  
One time to many I rubbed him wrong  
And he even'd up the score  
Now that's what happens when you  
Get too big for your britches  
I been down that road before  
  
Now when you get to thinking your really smart  
There's somebody smarter then you  
And no matter how much you boast and brag  
You can still learn a thing or two  
  
Go get you some treatments just like I've had  
And you wont hanker for more  
I've really learned the meaning of living and loving  
Cause I've been down that road before  
  
Now the man that walks this rocky road  
Usually gets just what he deserves  
  
But he's just a helpless servant to  
A master that he servers  
Now I've learned to slow my temper down  
And not to pick no scraps no more  
  
Boys its a lot easier on the head and the eyes  
Cause I've been down that road before.
