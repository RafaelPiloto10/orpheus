I don't want you to be no slave, I don't want you to work all day  
I don't want you to 'cause I'm set for you  
I just wanna make love to you, love to you, love to you  
I don't want you to wash my clothes, I don't want you to keep my home  
I don't want you to, I don't want you to  
I can tell by the way she walks, I can see by the way the baby talks  
I can know by the way you treat your man  
I can love you baby till the morning  
I don't want you to 'cause I'm sad and blue  
I just wanna make love to you, love to you, love to you
