Right there it is!  
Pretty faces perfect hair make 'I see you' when  
You float into my vision once again, yeah  
Promises are in your eyes, never to return  
Inside your love I'm bound to burn  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands and I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want  
Pretty faces break your heart words that turn to dust  
I need to love and you I trust  
Waiting for the wheel to turn shall I waste my life  
A key to hold to paradise  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands and I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
Love a we, a love a we, love a we, I love ya  
Love a we, a love a we, love a we, I need ya  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands but I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need
