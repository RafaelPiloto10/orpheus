Sometimes I think about our good old high school days  
You would always kid about my adolescent ways  
Oh, Mary, Mary, good to see you too  
Haven't seen to many of the old crew  
The time just flew, and how are you?  
  
Strange we should meet here  
Seeing off our friends  
It's hard to draw the line between  
Beginnings and ends  
Oh, Mary, Mary, must you go so soon?  
We must be a sight to see  
Salon and saloon  
I'll look you up soon  
Maybe sing you a tune
