You're just a mile away  
One thousand five tiny steps from here  
But if I brought you near  
Would you believe when I say,  
It seems like yesterday  
That I could reach out and touch your face,  
But as I fall from grace  
Into whose arms can I lay  
  
It's always much too late  
We get the signs  
We can't communicate  
Or turn back time  
  
So what will be now, do you feel somehow  
Not so together and not quite as strong  
Now I believe  
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely, after you've gone  
  
If it's a healing wind  
That cools the flame burning in my sight  
It must accelerate  
For two wrongs they don't make a right  
  
And all these solitaires, lone victories  
Wars fought in isolation, with none to please  
  
The future's still uncertain, the past is done
