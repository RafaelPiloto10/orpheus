Sweetest angels are still crying because, my babe, the world is dying. But if
they continue crying, their wings will break- that's bad for flying.  
  
Ref.: I'm going through my crises, my crises, paying prices everyday.  
  
I need you and you need me to unblind my eyes so that I can see... I see the
lights and I'm getting closer... From the sight I get happier, even doze off.  
  
Ref.: I'm going through my crises, my crises, paying prices... I'm taking
advises, advises, the last crises, everday.  
  
Everyday- it's for the Mom.  
Everyday- it's for the truth.  
Everyday- everyday...  
Everyday- for the truth.  
Everyday- take me there!  
Everyday- everyday...  
Everyday...  
Everyday...
