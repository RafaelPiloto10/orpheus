I'm a Russian Jew American  
Impersonating African Jamaican  
What I wanna be's an Indian  
I'm gonna be a cowboy in the end I guess  
I guess I bought a gun cause it impresses  
All the little girls I see  
And then they all wanna sleep with me  
  
Oh, where do we disappear?  
Into the silence that surrounds us  
and then drowns us in the end  
Where all these people who impersonate our friends  
Say, "Come again, come again, come again"  
  
Into the dark Italian underground of disco lights and disco sound  
And skinny girls who drink champagne  
And take me on their knees again  
Then pull me up and out the door  
Past railway cars and tranny whores  
And morning spreading out across the feathered thighs of angels  
  
Oh, where do we disappear?  
Into the silence that surrounds us  
and then drowns us in the end  
Where they try to push you out to keep you in  
And say, "Come again, come again, come again"  
  
In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue  
In 1493, came home across the deep blue sea  
In 1494, he did it with the girl next door  
In 1495, he barely made it out alive  
In 1964, these sailors left me at the door  
In 1970, some people got their hands on me  
Now I'm the king of everything  
And I'm the king of nothing  
Now I'm the king of everything  
I am the king of nothing  
  
Oh, where do we disappear?  
Into the silence that surrounds us  
And then drowns us in the end  
Where all these people who impersonate our friends  
Say, "Come again, come again. come again"  
  
Oh, where do we disappear?  
Into the silence that surrounds us  
And then drowns us in the end  
Where they try to get you out to get you in  
And all these people who impersonate our friends  
Say, "Come again, come again, come again"
