Darlin' come under cover  
Another night to discover  
Let's slip where senses gather  
Let's drift between the sea and sky  
As the night goes by  
  
Sands shift  
Orchids so strange  
In the moonlight  
Brushing our faces  
Places where love blooms  
And dies  
While the night goes by  
Oh, and the spirits call  
Sun upon your shadows fall  
Tracing every breath we draw  
  
Come into my dreams  
Come into my dreams  
Darlin' let's go where the night goes  
Let's drift where senses gather  
Let's make this night last forever  
Into my dreams  
Into my dreams  
  
Darlin' let's go  
Where the night goes  
Time slips  
Oh darlin' how it flies  
When the night goes by  
  
All through the night  
Sirens call  
Come to me  
I'll come to you  
As the night softly  
goes by bye  
  
Midnight  
Moon on our shoulder  
Daybreak  
Another one older  
Darlin' heavenly blue  
Glories fade into view  
  
Let's go  
Under the stars  
That are beating  
Under the moonlight  
Stars shoot  
Dusk just a whisper  
Make this night  
Last forever  
Oh how I wonder  
Where the night goes  
Oh Let's wonder  
Where the night goes  
As the night goes  
By bye  
By bye
