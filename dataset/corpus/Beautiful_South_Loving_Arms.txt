(T. Jans)  
Originally performed by Etta James  
  
If you could hear me now  
The one who said that  
She'd rather roam  
The one who said  
She'd rather be alone  
If you could only hear me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment I could really make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
Cause I've been too long  
In the wind  
And too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
  
Looking back and hoping for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
If you could see me now  
Singing somewhere through the lonely night  
And dreaming of the love that held me tight  
If you could only see me now  
  
Cause I've been too long in the wind  
And too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
  
Looking back and hoping for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
I can almost feel your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again
