It was another day  
A perfect texas afternoon  
A mother and two children play  
The way they always do  
As they raced home from the mailbox  
A mother and her son  
Against a little girl of 6 years old  
The independant one  
  
The deputies went door to door  
Through all the neighborhood  
They said I got some news to tell you folks  
I'm afraid it aint so good  
Somehow something happened  
Someone got away  
Someone got the answers for what happened here today  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
Now the people from the papers and the local tv news  
Tried to find the reason  
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues  
Someone shouted hit and run  
The coroner cried foul  
Her blue dress was what she wore  
The day they laid her body down  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
I know tonight that theres an angel  
Up on heavens highest hill  
And no one there can hurt you baby  
No one ever will  
Somewhere someones conscience is like a burning bed  
The flames are all around you  
How you gonna sleep again  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15
