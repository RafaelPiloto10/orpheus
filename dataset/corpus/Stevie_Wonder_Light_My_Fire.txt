Oh baby, you know that it would be untrue  
Know that I would be a liar  
If I was to say to you  
Hey girl, you know we couldn't get much higher  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come, baby, light my fire, yeah  
Try to set the night on fire  
The time to hesitate is through  
There's no time to wallow in the mire  
If we try now we can only lose  
And our love may come a funeral pyre  
Hey, hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come on, baby, light my fire, yeah  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby, baby  
Hey, hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Oh baby, come on, baby, light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire, yeah baby, oh babe  
You know that it would be untrue  
And you know I would be a liar  
Don't let it [Incomprehensible] and say to you  
Hey baby, we couldn't get much higher  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come on, baby, light my fire, baby, yeah, baby  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire [Incomprehensible]  
Come on, baby, light my fire, baby  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby, baby
