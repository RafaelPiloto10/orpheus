[Verse 1]  
Can you just stay through the night?  
Turn down the bed and the blinds  
Before your turn around  
Can you just stay through the night?  
Let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends  
And we fall through the hole in the light  
Make this our kingdom  
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
Know I won't let the blue flame die  
We can't lose hope just yet  
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime  
And we're scared to love but it's alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that we're surefire, yeah  
Know that we're surefire, yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Can't keep this bed warm on the left side  
When something is cold as a goodbye  
Why don't you turn around?  
Ignore all that shit from the outside  
The world is a nightmare  
Wake up and stay here  
Let me be on your side  
We'll make this our kingdom  
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God  
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting  
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
Know I won't let the blue flame die  
We can't lose hope just yet  
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime  
And we're scared to love but it's alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that we're surefire  
Know that we're surefire  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God  
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting  
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
If we just let the blue flame die  
The devil wins this bet  
Oh it's once, just once in a lifetime  
And you're scared to love but it's alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that we're surefire  
Know that we're surefire
