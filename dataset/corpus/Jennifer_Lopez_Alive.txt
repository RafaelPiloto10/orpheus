Time goes slowly now in my life  
Fear no more of what I'm not sure  
Searching to fill your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
Love, in and out of my...my heart  
And though life can be strange I can't be afriad  
Searching to fill your soul  
  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be  
  
... Alive... hahaha (chuckling softly)
