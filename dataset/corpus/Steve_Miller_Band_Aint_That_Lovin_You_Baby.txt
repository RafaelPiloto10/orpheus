[Chorus:]  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
  
Listen to me, baby  
What I say is true  
They could drop me in the ocean  
I'd swim to the bank  
And get back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They may kill me, darlin'  
Honey, just like they do  
Well, my body might die  
But my spirit's gonna rise  
And crawl back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
Don't even know my name  
  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
Said, you don't even know my name  
Said, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name
