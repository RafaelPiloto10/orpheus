Bessie was more than just a friend of mine  
We shared the good times and the bad  
Many years have since passed me by  
I still recall the best thing I ever had  
  
Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh... To see her soon  
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do  
  
Now all the crazy things I had to try  
Well I tried them all and then some  
If you look you one day you will find out  
Where it is that your really coming from  
  
Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh... To see her soon  
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do  
  
Now in my day I've made some foolish moves  
But back then I didn't worry about a thing  
Now and again I still wonder to myself  
Was it the sweet love, or the way that she could sing  
  
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie  
Oh... To see her soon  
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do
