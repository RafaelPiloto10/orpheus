You were always were so nice  
when it came to problems you knew  
I never did think twice about ever coming to you  
  
So granny, what on earth can I do?  
Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild  
  
You always straightened me out  
When I was feeling rough  
But this one I really doubt  
Cause this one's really tough  
  
Oh granny, what on earth can i do?  
Granny, granny, what on earth can i do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild  
  
So, granny, what on earth can i do?  
Granny, granny, what on earth can i do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild
