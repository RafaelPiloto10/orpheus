Gazing through the window at the world outside.  
Wondering will Mother Earth survive.  
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her, sometime.  
  
After all there's only just the two of us.  
And here we are still fighting for our lives.  
Watching all of history repeat itself, time after time.  
  
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away.  
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days.  
  
I watch the sun go down like everyone of us.  
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign.  
A better place for those who will come after us, this time.  
  
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away. (oh yeah)  
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days.  
  
Your higher power maybe God or Jesus Christ.  
It doesn't really matter much to me.  
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us.  
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah!  
  
If only we could all just find serenity.  
It would be nice if we could live as one.  
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?  
  
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away. (today)  
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days. (ok)  
I'm just a dreamer, who's searching for the way. (today)  
I'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away. (oh yeah yeah yeah)
