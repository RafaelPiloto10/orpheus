I was taught to believe and never to doubt  
the man up above knows what he's talkin' about.  
So, when I heard that voice, so loud and clear,  
speak to my heart, I knew that she must be near.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life and treat her right.  
  
I never was the one to listen very well.  
I walked my own way and felt what I felt,  
further out of touch with the master plan,  
but she was like a flight to the Promised Land.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right.  
  
He placed an angel in the palm of my hands.  
And for once in my life, I obeyed His commands.  
I'll take her and love her forever, take care of her for life.  
Ooh, never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right.  
Ooh, just treat her right.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, treat her right.  
For life.
