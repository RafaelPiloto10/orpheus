Have you seen her? So fine and pretty  
Fooled me with her style and ease  
And I feel her from across the room  
Yes, it's love in the third degree  
  
Ooh, baby baby  
Won't-cha turn your head my way?  
Ooh, baby baby  
Ah come on! Take a chance  
You're old enough to  
  
Dance the night away  
Whoa-oh (Ah) Come on g-girl, dance the night away  
  
A live wire, barely a beginner  
But just watch that lady go  
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh  
Anything else she knows  
  
Ooh, baby baby  
Won't-cha turn your head my way?  
Ooh, baby baby  
Well don't skip romance 'cause  
You're old enough to  
  
Dance the night away  
Oh-oh-oh (Ah) Come on g-girl, dance the night away  
  
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh yeah  
  
Dance (oh) the night away. Hey, hey, yeah!  
Dance, dance, dance the night away  
Ah come on baby (Dance the night away) Hey, hey yeah!  
Dance, dance, dance the night away  
Uh, come on baby, baby , Dance the night away Ooh, ooh, yeah  
Dance, dance, dance the night away. Ah, ha ow!
