Step aside  
Step aside  
The krewe's gonna take a ride  
Better stand behind the barricade  
Here comes, here comes, here comes  
The big parade  
  
So make way  
So make way  
That's what the captain say  
Down st. Charles and esplanade  
Here comes  
The big parade  
  
"throw me somethin mister"  
I wanna dance with your sister  
Brass bands marchin by  
Throwing notes to the sky  
  
There goes  
There goes  
Second-liners and flambeaus  
I'm feelin even better  
Than the day was made  
Here comes  
Here comes  
Here comes  
The big parade
