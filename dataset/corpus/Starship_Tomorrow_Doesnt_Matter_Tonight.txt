You already made up your mind  
Just who you're looking for and what kind of love you'll find  
Holding out for a dream  
But I can see you're lonely, living isn't only a fantasy  
  
I don't fit into your plans, but you can reach for my hands  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, 'cause tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
Really hate to see you confused  
I want no promises, so what have you got to lose  
When you look in my eyes  
Don't think about tomorrow, this feeling isn't meant to be analyzed  
  
Why should you be all alone 'til your heart finds a home  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, 'cause tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, tomorrow) Let yourself go!  
(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, tomorrow)  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter at all, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
Tonight!
