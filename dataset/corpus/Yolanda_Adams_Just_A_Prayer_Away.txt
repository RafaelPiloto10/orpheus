I know that there are times in your life  
When the wheels just seem to turn  
And uncertainties about your tomorrow seem to grow  
One thing you should remember  
And you should always know  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear every word you say  
When you cry at night  
I'll wipe the tears away  
Just pray, my love  
And I'll be there right away  
You will never have to wonder about My love  
Just put your faith and trust in My care  
I will always be there to hold you in my arms  
When you're afraid don't worry  
I'll protect you from the storm  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear  
I am just a prayer away  
Call my name with your heart  
And I'll hear every word you say  
When you cry at night  
I'll wipe the tears away  
Just pray my love  
And I'll be there right away
