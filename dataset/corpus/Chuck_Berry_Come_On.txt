Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted  
All day long I'm walkin' 'cause I couldn't get my car started  
Laid off from job and I can't afford to check it  
I wish somebody'd come along and run in to it and wreck it  
  
Come on, since my baby parted, come on  
I can't get started, Come on  
I can't afford to check it  
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it  
  
Everything is wrong since I been without you  
Every night I lay awake thinkin' about you  
Everytime the phone rings sounds like thunder  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number  
  
Come on, since I been without you, Come on  
Steady thinkin' 'bout you, Come on  
Phone sounds like thunder  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number  
  
Everything is wrong since I last saw you baby  
I really want to see you and I don't mean maybe  
I'm doin' everything tryin' to make you see  
That I belong to you honey and you belong to me  
  
So come on, I want to see you baby, Come on  
I don't mean maybe, Come on  
I'm tryin' to make you see that I belong to you and you belong to me  
Come on
