I can't reach behind your eyes  
You always look away  
You hide behind your alibis  
And change your mind  
from day to day  
If there's something I can do  
Then I'll be there  
Outside your broken world  
You'll see it's me who cares  
Take me straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real  
and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know  
I've been there before  
Straight to your heart  
I watch you move  
and I watch you dance  
I watch you drift away  
And I'd give anything for you  
And you know that's bad  
When it gets that way  
You can't go on like this  
And I don't want to fight again  
I don't give a damn anymore  
Right or wrong you're gonna let me in  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know I've been there before  
Straight to your heart this time this time  
Baby I know where you are  
Cause you know I've been there before  
Then maybe I'll break down the walls  
And my love will go  
Straight to your heart  
Inside  
Take me inside yeah  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause this time we're goin' all the way  
Straight to your heart  
This time  
This time  
Baby it's straight  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
This time it's straight to your heart  
Oh yeah  
Cause this time it's real
