Just a matter of time, till you run out of breath  
Money mountains you climb, never hedging your bets  
But your luck can run out, you'd better watch your step  
Just a matter of time  
  
Just a matter of days, till the factory's done  
When they shut down the lathes 'cause the work has all gone  
And nobody cares 'cause there's no-one  
It's just a matter of days  
  
I know what you mean and I suppose I agree  
I'm a bit pushed for time, please don't bother me  
Take you guidance elsewhere, 'cause I've heard it before  
In case is not very clear, I don't care anymore  
  
Just a matter of hours until you're forgotten  
Your pushing up flowers, and you're used to the rot  
So that was your life, didn't manage a lot  
Just a matter of hours  
  
I know what you mean and I suppose I agree  
I'm a bit pushed for time, please don't bother me  
Take you guidance elsewhere, 'cause I've heard it before  
In case is not very clear, I don't care anymore  
I know... care anymore (repeat till end...)
