Madder than a mad man and bored to the core.  
Minute hand crawling can't take it any more.  
Future's up the highway, ya gotta get away.  
Gonna take a little trip and find a tijuana stray.  
  
Got the time to take it.  
Got the balls to break it.  
Gotta a car that it'll make it.  
South of the border,  
Don't drink the water.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have two tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Time bomb is tickin', my head's about to bust.  
Need your personal attention or I swear I'm gonna rust.  
Find a little place.  
No one will tell you what to do.  
Tell her I'm a rebel.  
She says.  
Yea without a clue.  
  
Just need some understanding.  
A girl who ain't demanding.  
Who ain't afraid to fake it.  
South of the border,  
Don't drink the water.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have two tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Need some understanding.  
A girl who ain't demanding.  
A little bad behavior.  
She's gonna be my saviour.  
My knees are shakin'.  
My back is breakin'.  
Oh mama mia A' senorita.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have three tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have some tequila.  
Need sneakers.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
Just heard the bell.  
That got me outta hell.  
Got a girl.  
I gotta life.
