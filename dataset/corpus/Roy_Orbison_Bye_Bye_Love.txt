Bye bye love bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness I think Im gonna cry  
Bye bye my love goodbye  
There goes my baby with someone new  
She sure looks happy I sure am blue  
  
She was my baby tlll he stepped in  
Goodbye to romance that might have been  
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness I feel like I could die  
Bye bye my love goodbye  
  
Im free from romance Im through with love  
Im through with counting the stars above  
And heres the reason that Im so free  
My loving baby is through with me  
  
Bye bye love bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness I think Im gonna cry  
Bye bye my love goodbye  
Bye bye my love goodbye
