Mystereality  
It's not the same game anymore  
A-nor the time or the places before  
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know  
  
If you see me you'll be asking  
It's always take take take take take take take take  
Oh reality don't fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
Mystereality  
Well really it's all just promises  
You know how much I hate the unforeseen  
Oh don't you know  
  
A-never never a regard for the truth  
What's the meaning of that mister are  
Oh reality don't fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
My my reality  
So where did we go wrong  
Have you seen just a-recently  
The lengths to which we've been  
  
Now you could say that it's time  
Escapes they seldom work  
Oh reality don't fool me  
I count on you to know
