Come here sister  
Papa's in the thing  
Ain't you hip, of that new green thing  
It ain't no drag  
Papa's got a brand new bag  
  
It's gone berserk  
He's going to fly  
Don't playing cheap  
You know he's not shy  
Imagnitate her, the alligator  
Jump back Jack, see you later alligator

Ain't no drag  
Papa's bought himself a brand new bag  
  
Au, come on, hey hey, come on

He's uptight, Mr. Pity that's my name  
Got it, yeah

He's doing the fly  
Don't playing cheap  
You know he's not shy  
Imagnitate her, the alligator  
Jump back Jack, see you later alligator
