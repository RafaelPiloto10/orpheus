Only a downstat  
Personality problem  
He would say things like 'I love you'  
And cry real tears  
Met him in some place  
Like a home for old mothers  
Where the cure is always death  
But no-one ever leaves  
He wore a number 7  
Badge on his collar  
He would show it with pride  
And say 'it means I can feel'  
He'd bribe the warders  
To send letters to someone  
Who didn't even know his name  
But said she'd read them anyway  
And in the evening (??)  
He writes poetry for people  
Who deny he's alive  
And say 'I'll mention that name'  
A violator of the law of no feelings  
They should be put in the chair  
Until their eyes come in (??)  
If you have reasons  
I might sell you my time  
I'll leave it under the stairs  
In a body of mine  
Old memories are slowly fading out of me  
We are the unknowns, we are all you need
