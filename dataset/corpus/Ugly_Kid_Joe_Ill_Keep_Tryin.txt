If I had the time and lotsa money  
The I'd take you 'round the world  
'N' if I had a dime for every penny  
Then I'd buy you diamonds girl  
You don't even know how much I love you  
And how much I want to be  
Your knight in shining armor, yeah, baby  
That's good enough for me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'll keep tryin'  
Yeah I'll keep tryin', to make you mine  
Mine all mine  
I hope you're buyin', I hope you're buyin'  
All of my lines  
  
Now if I was the king and had a castle  
Then you'd surely be my queen  
We would live up in the tallest tower  
And we rarely would be seen  
You don't even know how much I need you  
And how much you mean to me  
I'm dog without a bone hear me cryin'  
And it's time for you to see that  
  
[Chorus]
