Close your legs, open your mind  
Leave those compliments well behind  
Dig a little deeper into yourself  
And you may find  
  
Come over here just sit right down  
Needn't comb your hair, needn't pout or frown  
I hear you've turned our young men  
Into dribbling clowns  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
  
Make their day and go ahead  
Remove your clothes lie on their bed  
Just a last gasp chance or an outside bet  
To the easily led  
  
And before you do just what you do  
Here' one thought for you to chew  
The men who run the business that you sell  
They screw you too  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
  
You're just another 365 night stand  
But you're so handy, you're so handy  
You cheapen and you nasty every woman in this land  
But you're so handy, you're so handy  
  
Your picture's hanging pretty on the squaddies' walls  
You're Steven's, Andy's, you're Ian's, you're Paul's  
Your body's through of fondly in the rugby mauls  
But you want more  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
  
36D so what (D) so what  
Is that all that you've got?  
He was trying to save his job  
He was, he was trying to save his job.
