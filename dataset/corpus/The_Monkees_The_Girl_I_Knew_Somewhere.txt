You tell me that youve never been this way before.  
You tell me things I know that Ive heard somewhere.  
Youre standing in the places and youre  
Staring down through faces, that bring to mind traces  
Of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere.  
  
I just cant put my finger on what it is  
That says to me watch out! dont believe her.  
I cant give any reasons girl,  
My thoughts are bound down in a whirl.  
I just cant think who in the world was that girl,  
I know I met her somewhere.  
  
Someway, somehow this same thing was done.  
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong.  
  
Well, goodbye dear, I just cant take this chance again.  
My fingers are still burning from the last time.  
And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame.  
Thats as may be, I cant explain.  
  
Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere.
