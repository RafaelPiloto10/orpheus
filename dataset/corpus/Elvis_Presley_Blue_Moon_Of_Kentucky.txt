Blue moon  
Blue moon  
Blue moon, keep a-shinin' bright  
Blue moon, keep on a-shinin' bright  
You're gonna bring-a me back-a my baby tonight  
Blue moon, keep a-shinin' bright  
  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
A-well-a, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shinin' bright  
Whispered on high  
Love's said goodbye  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Well I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
A-well-a, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shinin' bright  
Whispered on high  
Love's said goodbye  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
