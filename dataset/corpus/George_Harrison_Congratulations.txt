Congratulations for breaking my heart  
Congratulations for tearing it all apart  
Congratulations you finally did succeed  
Congratulations for leaving me in need  
  
This morning I looked out my window and found  
A bluebird singing but there was no one around  
At night I lay alone in my bed  
With an image of you goin around in my head  
  
Congratulations for bringing me down  
Congratulations now I'm sorrow bound  
Congratulations you got a good deal  
Congratulations how good you must feel  
  
I guess that I must have loved you more than I ever knew  
My would is empty now cause it don't have you  
And if I had just one more chance to wind your heart again  
I would do things differently but whats the use to pretend  
  
Congratulations for making me wait  
Congratulations now its too late  
Congratulations you came out on top  
Congratulations you never did know when to stop  
  
Congratulations
