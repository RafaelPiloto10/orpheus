Why did you tell me this?  
Were you looking for my reaction?  
What do you need to know  
Don't you know I'll always be your girl?  
You don't have to prove to me  
You're beautiful to strangers  
I've got loving eyes, of my own  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You belong to me  
Tell her... tell her you were fooling  
You belong to me  
You don't even know her  
You belong to me  
Tell her that I love you  
You belong to me...  
  
You belong to me  
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure  
You belong to me  
Thought we'd closed the book and locked the door  
You don't have to prove to me  
That you're beautiful to strangers  
I've got loving eyes of my own  
Of my own...  
And I can tell  
I can tell darling...  
  
Tell her... tell her that I love you  
You belong to me  
You belong... you belong... you belong to me  
You belong to me  
Tell her you were fooling  
You belong to me  
Tell her she don't even know you  
  
Tell... her, tell her you were fooling  
You belong to me  
I know you from a long time ago baby  
You belong to me  
Don't make me go to her house  
You belong to me  
You belong... you belong... you belong to me  
  
You belong to me...  
You belong to me...  
You belong to me...  
You belong to me...
