New shoes, on my feet  
New shoes, on my feet  
Dancin' with you baby, made me feelin' good  
But these shoes I'm wearin' don't fit me like they should  
The man who put 'em on me, said they'd fit me right  
Think he done me dirty, they're feelin' kinda tight  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), they're on my feet (on my feet)  
When we're dancin' baby, I can dig the groove  
I can cut it baby, till the music starts to move  
My toes are gettin' stepped on, out here in the crowd  
Can't you hear 'em screamin', daddy-o let us out  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), they're on my feet (on my feet)  
  
Hate to see our romance goin ' down the drain  
I'll pull off my shoes, if you would do the same  
If you really love me, like I think you do  
Let your feet go crazy, I'll go crazy too  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)  
New shoes (new shoes), new blues (new blues)
