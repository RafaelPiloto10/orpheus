You say you stand by your man  
Tell me something I don't understand  
You said you loved me and that's a fact  
But then you left me, said you felt trapped  
Well some things you can't explain away  
But the heartache's in me till this day  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
All the times when we were close  
I remember these things the most  
I see all my dreams come tumbling down  
I can't be happy without you around  
So alone I keep the wolves at bay  
And there's only one thing I can say  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me?  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
  
Now I got a job and it don't pay  
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay  
But without all of these things I can do  
But without your love I won't make it through  
But you don't understand my point of view  
I suppose there's nothing I can do  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me?  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way
