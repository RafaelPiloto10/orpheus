Punctured bicycle  
On a hillside desolate  
Will nature make a man of me yet?  
  
When in this charming car  
This charming man  
  
Why pamper life's complexity  
When the leather runs smooth  
On the passenger's seat?  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I haven't got a stitch to wear  
This man said "it's gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care"  
  
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said "return the ring"  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I haven't got a stitch to wear  
This man said "it's gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care"  
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man  
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man  
  
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said "return the ring"  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things
