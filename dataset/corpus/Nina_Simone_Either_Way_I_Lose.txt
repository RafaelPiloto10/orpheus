If I stay, I know I'm that I'ma share your love and that I couldn't take.  
And if I go, we'll be apart and I know my heart would surely break.  
So, what difference does it make, which one I choose?  
Either way I lose.  
  
Though I know, my love is true.  
I'd die if you ever told me good-bye.  
Ever told me good-bye.  
And I know, she loves you too.  
She would do, the same as I.  
  
What difference does it make, which one I choose?  
Either way I lose.  
Either way I lose.  
Either way I lose.
