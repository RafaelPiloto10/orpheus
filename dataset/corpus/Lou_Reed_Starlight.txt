Starlight open wide, starlight open up your door  
This is New York calling with movies from the street  
Movies with real people, what you get is what you see  
Starlight open wide, Andy's Cecil B. DeMille  
Come on L. A. give us a call  
We've got superstars who talk, they'll do anything at all  
Ingrid, Viva, Little Joe, Baby Jane, and Edie S.  
But you better call us soon before we talk ourselves to death  
Starlight open wide everybody is a star  
Split screen 8-hour movies  
We've got color we've got sound  
Won't you recognize us, we're everything you hate  
Andy loves old Hollywood movies, he'll scare you hypocrites  
to death  
You know that shooting up's for real  
That person who's screaming, that's the way he really feels  
We're all improvising, five movies in a week  
If Hollywood doesn't call us - we'll be sick  
Starlight open wide  
Do to movies what you did to art  
Can you see beauty in ugliness, or is it playing in the dirt  
There are stars out on the New York streets  
We want to capture them on film  
But if no one wants to see them  
We'll make another and another  
Starlight let us in that magic room  
We've all dreamt of Hollywood, it can't happen too soon  
Won't you give us a million dollars the rent is due  
Andy will give you 2 movies and a painting  
Starlight open wide!
