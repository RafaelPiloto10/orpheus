All alone in a sleepless night  
Passing time with a runaway moon  
Talkin' to myself  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
It's been too long since I held you girl  
Twice a thousand miles  
But my heart won't beat alone  
I need the love I left behind  
  
Hold back the dawn awhile  
This will all work out  
Don't let this dream die  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
And I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again  
  
Now the night is dark with diamonds  
And I'm standing inside the rain  
Giving up your love  
Was the worst mistake I made  
There's a sound I hear in the distance  
Seems it's calling out my name  
Well I'll pay most any price  
I just hope I'm not too late  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Oh, it's true  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
I see a fire in the sky  
Just like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love
