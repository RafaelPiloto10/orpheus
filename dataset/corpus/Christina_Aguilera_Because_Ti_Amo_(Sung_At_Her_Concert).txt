I'm so confused  
Maybe it's because ti amo  
I wrote this whole thing  
Just because ti amo  
I sit alone and  
I'm playing the piano  
I feel so strange  
It's just because ti amo!!!  
  
I think I won't make it through  
You're always on my mind  
Please tell me you love me too  
Or else I'm gonna die  
Here is what you mean to me!  
You are an angel God sent to me  
And I just want you here with me  
Holding you all the time!  
  
When things go wrong  
Everything seems nice to me  
I don't know why  
But I think it's cause ti amo  
I can't live without you  
And I don't want to try  
The reason's obvious  
It is because ti amo!  
  
You mean the whole world to me  
You are my everything!  
You make me fly without wings  
It's just the way I feel!  
What else could I ever ask?  
You are the dream of a lifetime  
And I want you beside me  
Till the world stops to turn!  
  
I can't describe  
The way I feel inside  
I don't know why  
Maybe because ti amo  
All my friends wonder  
How I can be so lucky  
To have you in my life  
The answer's cause ti amo!
