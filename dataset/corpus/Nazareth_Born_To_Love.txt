Reach out and touch my fire  
I'll make you know you're alive  
Sweet love move in slow  
Stretching out like a wire  
I'll take you right to the top  
Girl as low as you can drop  
You'll thank the Lord up above  
Woman you'll know you've been loved  
I was born to love  
I was born to love  
Sure as there's stars up above  
I was born to love  
Born to love you  
Slow down now don't you run  
For you there's just no way out  
Made up my mind, not wastin' time  
You're what I'm thinkin' about  
I got myself on your case  
You just can't keep up the pace  
But you'll thank the Lord up above  
Woman you'll know you've been loved  
I was born to love  
I was born to love  
Sure as there's stars up above  
I was born to love  
Born to love you  
Hey girl don't be a fool  
Your bridges all have been crossed  
You've got it wrong, my love is strong  
So don't go countin' the cost  
I'm only thinkin' of you  
Give me just an hour or two  
Then you'll thank the Lord up above  
Woman you'll know you've been loved  
I was born to love  
I was born to love  
Sure, sure as there's stars up above  
I was born to love  
Born to love you  
I was born to love you
