I am waiting  
On a mountaintop  
For the moment that the sky will strike  
My apologies  
Are forever lost  
Soon to ashes in a flash of light  
  
Miles from away from me  
Hope is fading soon  
Gone forever it's a waste of time  
My intentions  
Like a sweeter room  
Only bring to me a fading light  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just teach my dark heart to feel  
All I've saved - why  
Is thrown away  
  
I am waning  
Like a single bloom  
Lost forever in the storm of life  
My intentions  
Like a sweeter room  
Only bring to me a fading light  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just show these wounds how to heal  
Here I am - oh why  
My last stand - oh why  
And I know For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show  
  
Throw me down  
  
It's been raining  
And now I will pay  
Woe is come to me  
  
I am the lightning rod  
  
I am waiting  
On a mountaintop  
Oh above me  
He will strike me!  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just teach my dark heart to feel  
All I am - oh why  
My last stand - oh why  
And I know  
For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show
