Sittin here worryin'  
While your lookin to find yourself  
Somebody else  
Me lovin' you and wantin' you baby  
And you not knowin' what you want yourself  
Why do you treat me so mean  
It hurts so bad  
All you want to do is just sit around and jive  
You don't' even know this woman's alive  
Sittin' here worryin'  
Knowin' your likin' to find yourself  
  
Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more  
You can't have love when your keepin' score  
All you pretty boys used to catch my eye  
I just want a man I can satisfy  
Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more
