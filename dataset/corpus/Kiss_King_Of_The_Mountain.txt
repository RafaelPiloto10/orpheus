Come on  
I'm gonna climb the mountain  
I'm gonna hit the top  
I wanna go where nobody's ever been  
I'm never gonna stop  
I'm gonna reign, I'm gonna shine  
I'm gonna beat the ground  
I'm gonna shoot through the night like a shot gun  
I'm gonna get on down, I wanna get on down  
I'm the king of the mountain, I'm the king of the mountain  
  
Listen, don't try to save my soul from destruction  
I'm never gonna fall  
Don't try to give me a piece of the action  
I'm gonna take it all  
All the kings horses, all the kings men  
We're gettin' crazy again and again  
Make up your mind, it's time we get goin'  
We're gonna get on down, we're gonna get on down  
  
I'm the king of the mountain, I'm the king of the mountain  
I'm the king of the mountain, I'm the king of the mountain  
Yeah, now  
Oh, yeah, king of the mountain  
Say it, king of the mountain  
I'm the king of the mountain, I'm the king of the mountain, yeah  
I'm the king of the mountain  
And the winner takes it all, let's go, let's go, let's go
