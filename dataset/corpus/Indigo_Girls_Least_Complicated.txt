I sit two stories above the street  
It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep  
There's life down below me though  
The kids are walking home from school  
  
Some long ago when we were taught  
That for whatever kind of puzzle you got  
You just stick the right formula in  
A solution for every fool  
  
I remember the time when I came so close to you  
Sent me skipping my class and running from school  
And I bought you that ring cause I never was cool  
What makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
  
So I just sit up in the house and resist  
And not be seen until I cease to exist  
A kind of conscientious objection  
A kind of dodging the draft  
  
The boy and girl are holding hands on the street  
And I don't want to but I think you just wait  
It's more than just eye to eye  
Learn the things I could never apply  
  
I remember the time when I came so close with you  
I let everything go it seemed the only truth  
And I bought you that ring, it seemed the thing to do  
  
What makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
So what makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
  
I'm just a mirror of a mirror myself  
All the things that I do  
And the next time I fall I'm gonna have to recall  
It's isn't love it's only something new

The least complicated  
The least complicated
