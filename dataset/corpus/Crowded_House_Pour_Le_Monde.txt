He imagines the world  
As the angel ascending  
Like the ghost of a man  
Who is tied up to the chair  
  
And he tries to believe  
That his life has a meaning  
With his hand on his heart  
Pour le monde, pas pour la guerre  
  
And I wake up blind  
Like my dreams were too bright  
And I lost my regard  
For the good things that I had  
And the radio was sad  
  
When you listen for good  
In a hope that comes to nothing  
'Cause the liars moved in  
And they believe their own dark medicine  
  
You act so nonchalant  
But he is not a dog  
Perform for you in the stadium  
For the world, not for the war  
  
And he won't hesitate  
Though it might lead to heartache  
In the nightclub Indigo  
For the world, not for the war  
Pour le monde, pas pour la guerre  
  
When you listen for good  
In the hope that comes to nothing  
'Cause the liars moved in  
And they believe their own dark medicine  
Believing it's good  
Behind their jaded eyes: a dilemma  
  
He's the best you've ever had  
He's so low you'll never know  
He's the best you've ever known  
He's so low you'll never know  
  
He's so low you'll never know  
(He's the best)
