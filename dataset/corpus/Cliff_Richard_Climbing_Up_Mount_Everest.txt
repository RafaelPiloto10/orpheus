Out of time  
Out of luck  
Thought I was just dreamin  
Then I woke up  
You said it was over  
The end of the line  
I'm telling everybody I'm fine  
But I'm just  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear it's like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless, like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Night after night  
I come home  
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown  
I don't understand it  
As hard as I try  
But I keep crossing over the great divide  
And it's like  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear it's like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless, like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Shine the light  
Ring the bell  
I guess you don't love me  
Well, well  
I'll go on  
I'll survive  
I don't know how but I'll try
