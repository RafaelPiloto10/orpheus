I was blinded by your love  
I was blinded by your love  
I couldn't talk to you last night  
Friends and strangers side by side  
I was blinded by your love  
  
Oh God knows  
We're walking through a fire  
Sound of breaking hearts around  
Oh you know, we're burning in desire  
City of the lost and found  
In a world of broken dreams  
We will build a better life  
You're my Venus in blue jeans  
Only the strong survive  
So come on baby, come on baby  
  
Dreams are made  
Made of deep emotion  
Love will feed a brand new world  
Baby, you need the shadows and devotion  
Living in a better world  
There's a heavy weather girl  
The clouds disappear  
The masquerade of loneliness  
Is drowning too much tears  
Come on baby, come on baby
