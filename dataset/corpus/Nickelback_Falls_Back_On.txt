No, I don't guess  
I don't sacrifice  
And I know  
I don't realize  
Just how much  
I can idolize...and I know and I know  
And then I find it falls back on  
On to me, to see, believe  
And down onto you, We do, it's true  
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe  
A word you say, and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out (find out)  
What's the deal  
And I guess you don't  
Simplify  
It's just, you had to  
Had to take, and I know and I know  
And then I guess it all falls back on you  
  
There's a fine line between right and wrong  
And I know we knew all along  
Just how much I can half belong...and I know and I know  
And then I find it all falls back on  
On to me, to see, believe  
And down onto you, we do, it's true  
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe  
A word you say, and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out (find out)  
What's the deal  
And I guess you don't  
Simplify  
It's just, you had to  
Had to take, and I know and I know  
And then I find it all falls back on you  
  
'Cause I'm really up on this  
'Cause I'm really up on this  
Time to see these people  
Where the hell do I get through to you?  
No, I don't guess  
I don't sacrifice  
And I know  
I don't realize  
Just how much  
I can idolize...and I know and I know  
And then I find it falls back on  
On to me, to see, believe  
And down onto you, we do, it's true  
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe  
A word you say, and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out (find out)  
What's the deal  
And I guess you don't  
Simplify  
It's just, you try to hesitate  
And then I find it all falls back on you  
On you
