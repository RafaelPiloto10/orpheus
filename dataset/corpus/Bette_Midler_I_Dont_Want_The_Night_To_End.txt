And I don't want,  
I, I don't want,  
I don't want the night to end.  
  
Oh, daddy, daddy.  
Oh, daddy, daddy.  
Wastin' half my life  
on platforms underground,  
the other half I'm spending  
as a desperate clown.  
My problem now is that  
you're nowhere to be found.  
In dark delicious dreams  
of you I'll drown.  
  
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hi.  
Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy.  
Ooooooooh. Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy.  
I don't want the night to end.  
  
Oh, baby, baby.  
Ohhhhh, my sweet baby.  
Wrapped around your soul  
is where I want to be.  
But in the night, blue music.  
All my eyes can see:  
Junkies in the rain,  
down on their knees.  
Tell me, what's to become  
of you and me?  
  
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  
Don't let it be, don't let it be over.  
No, no, don't let it be, don't let it be.  
I-i, I don't want the night to end.  
I don't want the night to end.  
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I don't want the night to end.  
Mmmm, say it again, now.  
I-i-i-i-i, I don't want, don't want the night to end.  
  
Don't let it be, don't let it be,  
don't let it be o-o-o-o-over.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
I don't want it to be over.  
Baby, I'm a soul to lend.  
I'm all, all alone. I don't want the night to end.  
Oh, mommy, mommy, I am falling.
