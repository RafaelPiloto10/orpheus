I remember every touch  
Every flower  
Every word you ever said  
I remember how we looked at each other  
The very first time we met  
I'll never forget  
  
I remember every smile  
Every letter  
Every kiss you gave to me  
How we'd talk, and you'd hold me for hours  
Until I'd fall fast asleep  
You said you would always be there  
Should I need your arms around me  
But now that I've fallen to my knees  
I don't think you give a damn about me  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
Did you leave in the middle of the night  
And forget to say goodbye?  
Did you feel it was time to go  
But you didn't wanna see me cry?  
It gets harder and harder  
For me to believe  
That you still love me  
So get on with it, baby, if you're gonna leave  
It's not worth saving  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
My heart is telling me it's too late  
To beg you to stay  
You wouldn't hear me anyway  
Yeah!  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
You're already gone  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
'Cause it feels like  
You're so gone
