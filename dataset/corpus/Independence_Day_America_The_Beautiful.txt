O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
  
O beautiful for pilgrim feet  
Whose stern impassioned stress  
A thoroughfare of freedom beat  
Across the wilderness!  
America! America!  
God mend thine every flaw,  
Confirm thy soul in self-control,  
Thy liberty in law!  
  
O beautiful for heroes proved  
In liberating strife.  
Who more than self their country loved  
And mercy more than life!  
America! America!  
May God thy gold refine  
Till all success be nobleness  
And every gain divine!  
  
O beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
  
O beautiful for halcyon skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the enameled plain!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
Till souls wax fair as earth and air  
And music-hearted sea!  
  
O beautiful for pilgrims feet,  
Whose stem impassioned stress  
A thoroughfare for freedom beat  
Across the wilderness!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
Till paths be wrought through  
Wilds of thought  
By pilgrim foot and knee!  
  
O beautiful for glory-tale  
Of liberating strife  
When once and twice,  
For man's avail  
Men lavished precious life!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
Till selfish gain no longer stain  
The banner of the free!  
  
O beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears!  
America! America!  
God she'd his grace on thee  
Till nobler men keep once again  
Thy whiter jubilee!
