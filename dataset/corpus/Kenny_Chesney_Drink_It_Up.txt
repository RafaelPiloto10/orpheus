[Verse:]  
Drink it up, don't waste a drop  
Squeeze every second out of that old clock  
Kick it back, man, enjoy the ride  
Keep livin' everyday like it's Saturday night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Let it roll at the big wheels turns  
Swing a lil gravel goin' through those turns  
You and me, we gotta soak it in  
Keep it plankin' like this party's gonna neva end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Get it while you can, take it to the limit  
Live out every single minute while you're in it  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up
