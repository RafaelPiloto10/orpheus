She say 'Wayne on me, Wayne on me' cause yo ass need drizzlin  
That pussy came gift-wrapped, bow and a ribbon  
And if she bounce that ass then I'm dribblin  
That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin

Clips hanging, no curfew

Riding around with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly ' ha!

Kidnap your ass, kill your ass  
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!  
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed  
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed  
Hit a nigga with a million shots  
What you call that' A million bucks  
Good weed, we pass around  
Money talks, mine got a nasty mouth

Til the motherfuckin' day I'm Cashin Out!
