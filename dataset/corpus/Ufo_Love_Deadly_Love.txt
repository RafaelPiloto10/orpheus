A greyhound bus weaves its way across town  
I'm sitting here thinking  
Never thought I could be brought down  
And low yes I'm sinking  
  
Bet on a wild one, I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming, dreaming, oh I saw you last night  
(I got a) 4 by 8 on Riker's Yard  
8 to 15 I'm doin' hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Shot through the head  
Air conditioning lead  
The honeymoon was over  
With the telephone bill  
  
Yes you've been tumbled  
With your fingers in the till  
The Chelsea Hotel with a private line  
Now it's payback time  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Through the shadows of my backyard  
Now brother I'm leaving a calling card  
This mission tonight  
Feels so right Mr. D.O.A.  
Some they can take it and some lie down  
Some just wear that thorny crown  
Like a halo round the head  
Oh now you're better off dead  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
There's a visit and one phone call  
And sometimes a stroll  
If I'm straight in five years  
Maybe remission or parole  
  
Bet on a wild one, I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming, dreaming, oh I saw you last night  
(I got a) 4 by 8 on Riker's Yard  
8 to 15 I'm doin' hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Five card stud that's your game  
I'll cut stack and lose it's all the same  
You could never say no never say no no no no  
Love deadly love, love deadly love  
Love deadly love, love deadly love  
Love deadly love, love deadly love
