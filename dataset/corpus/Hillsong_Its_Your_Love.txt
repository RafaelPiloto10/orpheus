Verse 1:  
Upon the hill on Calvary  
He came from Heaven's throne  
Our fallenness and mercy meet  
Where blood and water flow  
  
Verse 2:  
What grace divine what selflessness  
That Christ would bear the weight  
Our proof is scarred on hands that bled  
That we were worth every nail  
  
Chorus:  
And all the praise and glory to God  
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah  
For the King has carried the cross  
He is risen from the grave  
  
Verse 3:  
Beyond the tomb to holy skies  
He rose in victory  
And bridged for us the great divide  
His life is our liberty  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bridge:  
Your love  
It's Your love  
It's Your love  
That has saved me  
  
Your blood  
It's Your blood  
It's Your blood  
That has claimed me  
  
Bridge:  
Oh-Oh-oh  
Woah Woah  
(Repeat bridge x3)
