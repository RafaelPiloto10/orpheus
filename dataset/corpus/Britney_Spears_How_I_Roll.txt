Burn it all down  
Need to buy another round  
Till they light up in the sound of the speaker  
Knee socks  
Need tequila on the rocks  
Till you make your body pops to the speaker  
  
Burn it all down  
Need to buy another round  
Till they light up in the sound of the speaker  
Show your knee socks  
Put tequila on the rocks  
Till you make your body pops to the speaker  
  
(I wanna go) downtown where my posse's at  
(Because I got) nine lives like a kitty cat  
(You wanna roll, that's how I roll)  
(I wanna go) ding-ding when I hear that bass  
(I'm gonna do) my thing if you wanna taste  
(You better know, that's how I roll)  
  
Feel the earthquake  
Gonna make your body shake  
Till the seconds start to break in the speaker  
Can we get flow  
Helicopter in the sky  
'Cause we turn it up high in the speaker  
  
If you know what it takes to be my man  
We can go make love together  
You can be my fuck tonight  
We can tear it up tonight  
  
(I wanna go) downtown where my posse's at  
(Because I got) nine lives like a kitty cat  
(You wanna roll, that's how I roll)  
(I wanna go) ding-ding when I hear that bass  
(I'm gonna do) my thing if you wanna taste  
(You better know, that's how I roll)  
  
Shimmy shimmy oh  
Shimmy oh shimmy hey  
We could give them what they want  
Or we could take it away  
Try to love tonight  
We can tear it up tonight  
  
If you know what it takes to be my man  
We can go make love together  
You can be my fuck tonight  
We can tear it up tonight
