One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.  
  
"Come on girl"  
You said to me, "Let's fly away  
Follow me wherever I will go  
And we won't worry about tomorrow"  
  
One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.  
  
So things go  
And so you left, and we drifted apart  
Sorrow came, built in my heart a home  
And now I'm thinking about tomorrow.  
  
One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.
