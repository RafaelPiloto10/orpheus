[Jesse to Congregation] Don't you take me to  
Your preachers  
And blind me with  
Their teachings  
Take your sorrowed souls  
And give'em to the blind  
  
Are the Gods that made you lying  
To the bloodied faces  
And never cry  
How long you all  
Been waiting to die  
  
Blinded by your teachers  
Now they'll be hiding  
You'll be seeking  
Will you give'em mercy  
Hang'em on high  
Johnny get your guns for dying  
It's time for right'n all the wrongs they've lied  
Give me a shotgun  
Make it alright  
  
Don't tell me your  
Maker's laughing  
You're bleeding the world he made  
  
Shotgun the walls of wailing  
Come tell me  
When it starts again  
  
Running for our lives - will ya  
Tear down the walls and smile  
God in Heaven save us all tonight
