The sun is shining down  
There's not one cloud around  
Morning hits me  
Where I lay  
  
Everything was green  
A perfect day it seems  
Yeah he's got everything his way  
Oh but I've seen better days  
I've seen better days  
  
[Chorus]  
When the rain was pouring down  
And he had his loving arms wrapped around me  
I've seen better days  
  
The neighbors come and go  
They smile and wave hello  
And all the kids are out to play  
  
Lollipops and good times  
They look so much like mine  
But he has taken mine away  
Oh and I've seen better days  
Lord I've seen better days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Lord I miss 'em  
I've seen better days
