LALALALALA...............  
An old man on his death bed whispered to me "you are the master of your
destiny"  
A diamond is a diamond a stone a stone but a man's not all good nor all bad  
call them as you see them you'll stand alone You're the best friend that you
ever had oh yeah  
you're the best friend that you ever had  
  
So laugh when it's time to laugh, cry when it's time to cry, live while it's
time to live  
you'll die when it's time to die LALALALALALA....................  
  
Then he closed his eyes and left me alone, my old friend's death brought his
wisdom home  
A diamond is a diamond a stone a stone but a man's not all good nor all bad  
Call them as you see them you'll stand alone, you're the best friend that you
ever had oh yeah  
you're the best friend that you ever had  
  
So laugh when it's time to laugh cry when it's time to cry  
live while it's time to live you'll die when it's time to die  
LALALALALALALA.................
