Some time ago I told you goodbye I don't know why  
This crazy feeling has driven me mad I made you cry  
I was such a fool to see you go  
I know our love was kind and true  
Baby I can trust this feeling in me now  
Some time ago the love we shared seemed everlasting  
I never had the chance to think this paradise would end  
I was such a fool to see you go  
I know our love was oh so true  
Now I think this feeling's back in me now  
If ever I say I love you baby  
Will you ever understand me  
I figured out a way this feeling  
For quite a while it's you I'm dreaming  
Whenever I think of you there's one thing I wish  
You're thinking of me too I guess  
I hope you understand why  
That's why I'm gonna give it one more try

Hmm...
