Big Booty  
  
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more sausage  
Biscuits and gravy on the side  
You done said the wrong thing to me baby  
And you can kiss big booty good-bye  
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more cases  
Or fix you nothing else that's chicken fried  
Go on and find yourself another woman  
And you can kiss big booty good-bye  
Go on and find yourself a skinny woman  
Something a little more your size  
And don't come back to me a moaning  
When she cuts you off of burgers and fries  
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more chicken  
And no more Momma's chocolate pies  
And here's something heave for you baby  
You can kiss big booty good-bye  
play  
Go on and find yourself a skinny woman  
Something a little more your size  
And don't come back to me a moaning  
When she cuts you off of burgers and fries  
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more sausage  
Biscuits and gravy on the side  
You done said the wrong thing to me baby  
And you can kiss big booty good-bye  
And you can kiss big booty good-bye  
And you can kiss big booty good-bye
