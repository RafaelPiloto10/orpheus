Written by Lowell Alexander, Gayla Borders, Jeff Borders  
  
I'll cover, I'll cover you, I'll cover  
  
Hey now you know it's true  
After all that we've been through  
You can count on me  
When it comes down to the end  
I will always be your friend  
No matter where you go  
I want you to know now  
  
Chorus  
I promise my prayers  
I promise my heart  
I'll be thinking of you  
Wherever you are  
When the daylight is done  
When the night is so dark  
When I cannot be there  
I promise my prayers  
  
Down each road we take  
We're joined together when we pray  
No matter where life leads  
I will lift you up  
You'll be covered by his love  
The angels will find you  
I'm here to remind you now  
  
Chorus  
I'll cover, I'll cover you, I'll cover  
  
Beyond our understanding  
His hand is moving and we stand amazed  
I pray His love will guide you  
I know He's there beside you always  
  
Chorus
