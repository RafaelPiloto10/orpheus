This is the life you saved laid out before you  
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now  
Nothing can change the way I feel about you  
Better we go on our separate ways  
Nothing is left but the endless days  
Nothing to cry but your name  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Maybe this time next year we'll be together  
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies  
There was a silent dream, we made a promise  
We'd be there for each other forever  
Aboard like a ship on an ocean's roar  
Beating a path to your open door  
Nothing will keep me away  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
Each night I pray to God above  
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
Farewell to you, goodbye for me  
I will be waiting for you  
I will be lonely for you  
Don't you despair  
'Cause I will be there for you  
I will be there
