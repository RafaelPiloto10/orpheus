Restlessly turning, imprisoned and freed  
Still is the night but that' s not what I need  
Gimme repetitive motion,  
A circle, a notion  
A steam engine dream..  
  
Motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me  
  
Restlessly turning, imprisoned and freed  
Still is the night but that' s not what I need  
Tenderness found as the rhythmn goes round  
I' m caressed by the sound of my motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me  
  
Motor, motor sing your song  
Theirs or mine or his  
Motor, motor will I wake  
Close to where my true life is..  
  
Motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me..  
Transporting  
Transporting me..
