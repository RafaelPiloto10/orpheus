Oh, what a night.  
Late December back in '63.  
What a very special time for me,  
'Cause I remember what a night.  
  
Oh, what a night.  
You know, I didn't even know her name,  
But I was never gonna be the same.  
What a lady. What a night.  
  
Oh, I. I got a funny feeling when she walked  
In the room and I,  
As I recall it ended much too soon.  
  
Oh, what a night,  
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me.  
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surrender, what a night!  
  
I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder  
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under.  
Oh, what a night!  
  
Oh, I. I got a funny feeling when she walked  
In the room and I,  
As I recall it ended much too soon.  
  
Oh, what a night.  
Why'd it take so long to see the light?  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right.  
What a lady, what a night!  
  
I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder  
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under.  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)  
Oh, what a night!  
(Do, do, do, do, do. Do, do, do, do, do, do.)
