I'm running away from a feeling  
Hiding my face in the sand  
I'm scared to love and lose again  
I don't know if I can  
I don't need the night to remind me  
Where the lonely people go  
I try running away from love  
But, my heart keeps telling me no  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love  
Too many people  
Are standing in the shadow  
Standing in the shadow of love  
  
I've been living so long in the darkness  
I know the cold embrace of the night,  
When morning comes I close my eyes  
'cause I'm blinded with the light  
Taking a chance of a feeling  
Is like waiting for a flower to grow,  
So I stand at the crossroad, baby,  
Wondering which way to go  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love  
Too many people  
Are standing in the shadow.  
Standing in the shadow of love  
  
I'm running away from a feeling,  
Hiding my face in the sand  
I'm scared to love and lose again  
I don't know if I can  
I don't need the night to remind me  
Where the lonely people go  
I try running away from love  
But, my heart keeps telling me no  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love,  
Too Many people  
Are standing in the shadow,  
Standing in the shadow of love
