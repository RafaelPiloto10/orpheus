You're going crazy  
Running on empty  
You can't make up your mind  
You try to hide it  
But you had to say it  
Restless all this time  
So completely drained from everything that's in your life  
It's so wrong but you had to scream every thought you kept inside  
  
[Chorus:]  
One minute you laugh  
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black  
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts  
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back  
And you love  
And you hate  
And you wait  
'Cause one minute goes fast  
  
You just can't escape it  
You're losing patience  
You wonder what went wrong  
Everything changes  
Happy then jaded  
Always a different song  
Playin' in your head just when you think you got it down  
Out of nowhere you realize it's different music playing now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One minute goes fast  
One minute goes fast  
  
One minute you laugh  
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black  
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts  
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back  
And you love  
And you hate  
And you wait  
'Cause one minute goes  
One minute goes  
One minute goes fast
