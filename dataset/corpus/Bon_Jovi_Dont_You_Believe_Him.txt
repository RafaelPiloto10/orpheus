I know it's been a long time, since I called you last  
Remember all those dreams that we had, the time went by so damn fast  
You said I had to flaunt those girls I kept by my sides for kicks  
You let the rumors fly, it's nothing new  
What those little boys will do to get their fix  
  
You broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Since you left me baby, since you gone and stole my heart  
I remember the very night that I broke down and fell apart  
Girl you don't remember, what I'm up here to be  
Baby, baby don't you know, you're the biggest part of me  
  
It broke my heart when you said good bye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him  
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him
