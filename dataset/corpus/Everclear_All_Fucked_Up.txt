I am all fucked up  
And I am ready to break  
I don't wanna be the guy  
Who is always on the outside  
I wanna find my own  
Good place  
  
All fucked up  
And I don't know how  
How I ever got to where I feel  
Like I am dying on the inside  
I want to be happy  
But I don't know how  
  
I am all fucked up  
And it's always the same  
I always get so close,  
Then I let it get away  
I got no one but  
Myself to blame  
  
I'm all fucked up  
And I don't know why  
If the rest of my life  
Is going to be like this  
Think I would rather die  
I am all fucked up  
  
Yes, I am all fucked up  
You're happy  
When you are all fucked up  
Yes, I am all fucked up  
  
I am all fucked up  
Yes, I am ready to break  
I don't wanna be the guy  
Who is always on the outside  
I wanna find my own  
Good place  
  
All fucked up  
And I don't know how  
How I ever got to where I feel  
Like I'm dying on the inside  
I want to be happy now  
  
I am all fucked up  
And it is always the same  
I always get so close  
Then I let it get away  
I got no one but  
Myself to blame  
  
I am all fucked up  
And I don't know why  
If the rest of my life  
Is going to be like this  
Than I think I would rather die  
I am all fucked up
