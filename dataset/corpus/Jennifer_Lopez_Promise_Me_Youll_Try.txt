I know it's on your heart  
That a love like ours shall never fall apart  
You're so afraid of the rain  
So I'll take your hand  
And I'll love you in the best way that I can  
And I only expect the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't promise me forever  
Don't promise me the sun and sky  
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry  
Just hold me now  
And promise me you'll try  
  
Though I'm sure of what I feel  
Never though a love so true that felt so unreal  
And I'm a little afraid myself  
But if you love me day by day  
With all honest heart and a little faith  
Baby time will tell the tale  
  
[Chorus: x2]
