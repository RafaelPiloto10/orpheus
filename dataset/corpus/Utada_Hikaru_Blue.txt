I find hard to breathe  
As life just eats away  
At the faces that surround me  
They look tired today  
The lady at my table  
Doesn't want me here  
I just want to talk to her  
But would she laugh to my accent  
And make fun of me  
It doesn't seem like  
The blue sky's here for me  
  
There are no girls in here  
As far as I can see  
Only pin-up posters  
Looking down at me  
Watching papercups of coffee  
Growing cold before my eyes  
All the things I see  
That makes me realize  
I'm in this big world without you  
Nothing tomy name  
I never knew that  
Blue sky meant such pain  
  
I'm dying to be different  
In the coffee shop  
I lived to double strength  
Now my supplies are cut  
Oh, I'm older than my looks  
And older than my years  
I'm too young to take on  
My deepest fears  
I used to be confused  
But now I just don't know  
Since you left I've been watching  
Blue skies come and go
