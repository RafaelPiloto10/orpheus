Who colt the game  
Who colt the game  
It's not natty dready  
It must be bald heady  
Somebody play the wrong domino  
And want the world to flollow  
Someone is fillin' their sack  
In a completry? Black  
Who colt the game  
A you colt the game  
Why you play the bad card  
Now we catch you off guard  
Natty dread want to shuffle  
Not lookin' for nothin' to scuffle now  
Natty dread want to shuffle  
Not lookin' for nothin' to scuffle now  
Who colt the game  
Who colt the game  
One way in, one way out  
Some a holler some a shout  
Natty dread want to shuffle  
Not lookin' for nothin' to scuffle now  
  
Natty dread want to shuffle  
Not lookin' for no-one to hassle now  
You colt the game  
Divided in  
Why you play the bad card  
Now we catch you off guard  
Somebody play the wrong domino  
And cause the rest to follow  
Someoen is fillin' ya sack  
Well it's a completry? Black  
Who colt the game  
Who colt the game  
Now bout to fill your sack  
It's a completry black  
Natty dread want to shuffle

Speak the truth and do it ever  
Who colt the game  
'cause once you did it you'll do it again  
Who colt the game
