The sun still shines way up above  
But it don't matter now because  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory (Oh, yeah)  
If you see my dream, send it back home to me  
  
The stars still glow up in the night  
But somehow, they don't seem so bright  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory (Oh, yeah)  
If you see my dream, send it back home to me  
  
Cause I've been waiting for a long, long time  
Thought I'd found a way  
Now I just wait for someone to call  
I'm waiting for it every day  
  
Send it, on the wires  
Send it, on a plane  
Send it, on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
The music plays so loud and clear  
But somehow I can't make you hear  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory (yeah)  
If you see my dream, send it back home to me  
  
When you get what you want, it's a long way down  
And you can see for miles around  
When you lose it, nothing is for real  
If you see my dream, send it back to me  
  
Send it, on the wires  
Send it, on a plane  
Send it, on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
Send it, on the wires  
Send it, on a plane  
Send it, on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
Send it (Send it, send it)  
Send it  
Send it (Send it, send it)  
Send it on the wires (Send it, send it)  
Send it on a plane
