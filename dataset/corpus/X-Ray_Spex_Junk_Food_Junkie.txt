Johnny's got an addiction  
He's strung out without conviction  
He was raised with a microwave  
Sticky trashy fast food slave  
  
He's a junk food junky  
He could be a lot more spunky hunky  
But he's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah, you know it's bad  
  
Mother doesn't really know  
Shopping in a glossy show  
Then again her budget's low  
Her health so bad it makes her slow  
She's a junk food junky  
She's stressed and very jumpy  
She's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah, we know its bad  
Blame it on the food yeah, we know it's bad  
Jenny's in a fix  
With her arithmetics  
Poor concentration  
Boys in the classroom cause agitation  
  
She's a junk food junky  
She could be a lot more fun  
  
But she's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
You know it's bad  
You know it's bad  
be a d ! !
