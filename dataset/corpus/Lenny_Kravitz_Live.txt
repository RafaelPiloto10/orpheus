You give me straight like ??? yard  
Tired of all the talk they're talkin' all over this town  
I'm tired of all the negativity that's going 'round  
We focus all our energy on things that bring us down  
  
Let's put our voices all together and make a joyful sound  
Do just what you want to do  
Oh let the sun come shining through  
Everybody  
  
Live live  
Everybody live  
Everybody live  
You got to do it ...  
  
Life is the most precious gift I thank the Lord for mine  
I hope you feel the same my friend I hope you're feeling fine  
The choice is yours your destiny is waiting on the line  
You better get busy with living or you're busy dying  
  
Do just what you want to do  
Oh let the sun come shining through  
Everybody  
Live, yeah yeah yeah yeah, live
