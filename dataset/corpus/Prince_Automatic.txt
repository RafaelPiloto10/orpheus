You ask me if I love you, it's automatic  
Cause every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic to  
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict  
So stop the music baby, you know, You're all I want to do

You ask me if I'll kiss you, it's automatic  
And if you cry, me cry, boo-hoo, that's automatic to

Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream  
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme  
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love  
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of  
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed  
Not with our lips but with our souls  
Stop me if I bore you  
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?  
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?  
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked,  
Can you hear me?  
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me  
  
Stop the music baby, automatic fool  
  
When it comes to you I'm automatic baby  
There's no one else like me  
I'm the best you'll ever find  
No one else could understand you, you're to complex  
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you  
That's automatic to  
Can you hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure  
I'm addicted to your pain  
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Automatically insane

Hey  
Fasten your seat belts  
Prepare for takeoff  
  
(I remember how you kissed me)  
(Not with your lips but with your soul)  
(With you I'm never bored, talk to me some more)  
(I can hear you, I'm going to have to torture you now)
