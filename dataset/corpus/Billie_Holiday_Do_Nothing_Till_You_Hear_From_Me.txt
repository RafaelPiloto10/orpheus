Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams  
Of other one's dreams, is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word  
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But don't do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will
