Guess I was a fool to let you see  
Vanity got the better of me  
The loser's got to love  
Caught up in a fantasy  
I'm screaming at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
(The love grabbed a passion fatigue)  
  
Threw me a line to pull me in  
Tripping upon a flight of fancy  
Until the break of dawn  
I never thought to call  
I'm stranded at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
(The love grabbed a passion fatigue)
