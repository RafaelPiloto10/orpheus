You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad  
But while you were busy with business and booze  
I lost the wings and the halo I had  
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you can't blame me for it all  
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you don't know how it hurt me to
fall  
[ piano - steel ]  
You didn't think that your angel could wander but I'm just like you flesh and
blood  
While you had your drinkin' your buddies and business  
I guess I had too much time all alone  
You say I went...
