Somebody, please, if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille  
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly  
Somebody, please, if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this  
Lonely man  
All I ask is Lord, make her understand  
I'll die if she don't wait for me  
I heard a rumor from the guys in Cell A  
You've served your time and you are  
Leaving today  
Well, there is something you can do  
For me to help your old friend  
Help me, please  
'Cause I've got seven years in this  
Old pen  
Till I'm home again  
Somebody, please, if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille  
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly  
Somebody, please, if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this  
Lonely man  
All I ask is, Lord, make her understand  
I'll die if she don't wait for me  
To hear you tell it, you're all innocent men  
But I was guilty, and I'd do it all again  
Just to hold her for a minute or two  
I'd steal a king's crown, yes, I would  
If I don't reach that girl some way, I know  
There'll be another man around  
Somebody, please, if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille  
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing  
Her still  
Because I think about her constantly  
Ugh, somebody, please, if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this lonely man  
All I ask is, Lord, why don't you make her  
Understand because  
I'll die if she don't wait for me  
Oooooh, somebody, please, if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille  
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly...
