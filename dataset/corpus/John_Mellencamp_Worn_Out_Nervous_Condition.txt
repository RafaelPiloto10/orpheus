I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
  
I thought we were having fun  
We were walking in the sun baby me and you  
Now you give me the cheek every time we kiss  
And I don't know what to do so  
  
Go ahead and break my heart  
It's your time to break my heart  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
  
I heard the miracle in your voice  
The miracle gave me no choice  
What am I gonna do here by myself  
I'm so afraid of being all by myself so  
  
Go ahead and break my heart  
It's your time to break my heart  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
  
Go ahead and break my heart  
It's your time to break my heart  
Go ahead and break my heart  
It's your time to break my heart  
  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you  
I'm in a worn out nervous condition over you
