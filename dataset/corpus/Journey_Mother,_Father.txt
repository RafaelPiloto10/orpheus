She sits alone, an empty stare  
A mother's face she wears  
Where did she go wrong,  
The fight is gone  
Lord help this broken home  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, mother, father, sister  
Hey, come back, tryin', believein'  
Hey, mother, father, dreamer  
  
Don't you know that I'm alive for you  
I'm your sevenths son  
And when lightin' strikes the family  
Have faith, believe.  
  
With dreams he tried, lost his pride  
He drinks his life away  
One photograph, in broken glass  
It should not end this way.  
  
Through bitter tears  
And wounded years, those ties  
Of blood were strong  
So much to say, those yesterdays  
So now don't you turn away.  
  
[Chorus]
