Without your schemes my life it seems is empty,  
I spent all my time keeping you from doing wrong  
You were my only nemesis  
I'd foil your plans, but still I miss  
The moments when we didn't get along.  
So search your heart dear Doctor D  
And I am sure that you will see  
That you were always meant to be  
My only lifelong enemy  
But now your doing battle with a panda from Seattle  
I miss the moments when we didn't get along.
