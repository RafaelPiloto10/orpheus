From birth to five, you're learning  
From five to ten, you're playing  
By the time you're fifteen  
You're never wrong  
But then you turn around  
And it's all gone, your childhood  
  
Now daddy knows what he's saying  
You're in my arms and I'm praying  
That I'll be given the strength and time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood  
  
Every morning  
Your crying ends my sleep  
I kid on I'm angry  
But it's not a feeling I can keep  
There's no light outside  
I don't care 'cause I know it's true  
That in our house  
The sun shines out of you  
You've got your mother's looks  
Your're a beautiful little girl  
You'll break boys hearts  
All over this world  
Then one day you'll walk out the door  
And I know you'll break mine  
You'll break mine  
  
From birth to five, you're learning  
From five to ten, you're playing  
By the time you're fifteen you're never wrong  
But then you turn around and it's all gone  
Your childhood  
  
So you're trying to talk  
Any day now you'll walk  
You'll be running around  
Make me act like a clown  
'cause I live and I breathe  
For my little girl  
Our little girl  
The most important thing is this whole wide world  
Now daddy know what he's saying  
Your in my arms and I'm praying  
That I'll be given the strength an time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood
