Girl come running  
Girl come running  
Girl come running home  
  
When you get tired of running around  
(Runnin' around, all over town)  
All of your friends putting you down  
(Puttin' you down, all over town)  
Don't do your crying alone  
(All alone)  
Well baby girl come running home  
  
Some day you'll be feelin' so low  
(Lower than low, nowhere to go)  
Why don't you call on me girl, that's when I'll show  
(I love you so, I love you so)  
Don't do your crying alone  
(All alone)  
Hey baby  
Girl come running home  
  
Was it so bad girl?  
Just think of what we had  
I need you so  
(Come on baby, come on baby)  
Don't ever go  
(Come on baby, come on baby)  
  
You're gonna get lost feelin' so blue  
(Bluer that blue, baby it's true)  
And don't you forget that I'm feelin it too  
(Bluer than blue, baby it's true)  
Well don't do your crying alone  
(All alone)  
Whoa baby  
Girl come running  
Girl come running  
Girl come running home  
  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby  
  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby,  
Come on baby
