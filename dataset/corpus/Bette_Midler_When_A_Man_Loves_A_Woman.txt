When he held me in his arms,  
When he held me in his arms and said,  
Baby, baby, baby, you are the only one for me.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Can't keep his mind on nothing else.  
He'll trade the world  
For the good thing he found.  
Yeah, if she's bad, he can't see it.  
She can do no wrong.  
Turn his back on his best friend  
If he put her down.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Spend his very last dime  
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs.  
He'll give up all his comforts,  
Go out and sleep out in the rain,  
If she says, baby, that is how it's gonna be.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Gives her everything that he has,  
Tryin' to hold on to her precious love,  
Cryin, baby, baby please don't treat me bad.  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Down deep in his soul,  
She can bring him such misery.  
Yeah, she's bad, but, oooh,  
He's the last one to know.  
Lovin' eyes don't ever see.  
  
So, this man says he loves me, he loves me.  
He gives me everything, everything,  
Everything that he has,  
Tryin' to hold on to my precious love,  
Cryin', baby, baby, baby, don't you, don't you  
Treat me, treat me bad.  
Ohhhh, yeah.  
  
When a man loves a woman  
He can do her no wrong.  
He could never hold another girl.  
Oh, you tell me you love me, baby,  
And gonna hold me tight.  
Baby, baby, this is a man's world.  
No, no.  
Oh, baby, a change is gonna come down  
In this man's world.
