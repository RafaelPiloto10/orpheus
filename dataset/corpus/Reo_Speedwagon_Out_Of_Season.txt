I found out just a little too late.  
I had my doubt, but I decided to wait.  
Even though I could feel somethin' comin'  
It came as such a surprise.  
I should have known when you first started  
Runnin' away before my eyes.  
  
I'm so out of season  
You left me cold and I'm standin' here freezin'.  
I'm so out of season now.  
  
I lost out.  
I wasn't playing to win.  
And I think about  
How I just took it all in.  
  
Just when I thought  
I couldn't get any higher  
You cut me down to size.  
I should have noticed  
When you put out the fire.  
Instead, I just closed my eyes.  
  
I'm so out of season.  
You left me cold and I'm standin' here freezin'.  
I'm so out of season now.  
  
I'm so out of season  
You let me go and you gave me no reason.  
I'm so out of season now.
