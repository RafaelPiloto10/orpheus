was only seventeen  
I fell in love with a gypsy queen  
She told me: "Hold on"  
Her father was the leading man  
Said: "You're not welcome on our land"  
And then as a foe, he told me to go  
  
He took me to a little shack  
And put a whip across my back  
Then told her: "Leave me"  
I was out for quite a time  
Came back with her on my mind  
Sweet little girl  
She means all the world  
  
Oh, I want my gypsy queen  
Will she still be torn between  
Her father and lover  
One day I will go to him  
Strong enough to fight and win  
The kind of a man  
That he'll understand
