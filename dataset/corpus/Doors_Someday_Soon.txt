Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Familiar freaks will fill your living room  
Rugs lash out their lizard tongues  
You're not getting young  
You're not getting young  
  
But you're going to die  
And you're going to be needing all of your eyes  
  
You'll be all alone  
When the animals cry  
All by yourself  
In some infancy's lie  
  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Television bleeding like a harvest moon  
Flush the scissors down the hole  
You're getting old  
You're getting old  
  
And I hate to remind you but your going to die  
And you're going to be needing all of your lies  
  
You'll be all alone  
When the animals cry  
All by yourself  
In some infancy's lie  
  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon
