I was born on the dawn of a new society  
And I feel lucky that my eyes could see  
People standing up and being  
Who they want to be  
People made the music  
And the music may them free  
  
Now I was just a baby through  
The summer of love they say  
But it still feels like it was yesterday  
And if the road gets rough  
I pick up my guitar and play  
  
It's always been right by my side  
To help me on my way  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow  
Ain't anticipating what's to come  
And I don't need to worry 'bout  
The things I have not done  
Long as I got rock and roll  
I'm forever young  
  
Now we can't always understand this world  
Farther along we'll understand it all  
The '70s looked like we all  
Were headed for a fall  
But those who listened hard enough  
Could hear the summer call  
  
Now I was growing up through all of this  
My first beer and love and my first kiss  
You never learn the things in school  
You learn by living and going through  
You taught me to be myself  
How can I thank you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't it truth!
