(Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
You by my side  
You by my side  
(Ooh, ooh)  
  
The other day I saw you walkin' (ooh)  
You looked as pretty as a peach  
You seemed so near  
And yet somehow you're out of my reach (out of my reach)  
  
If I had you I'd have the power (I'd have the power)  
To do most anything I choose (whatever you wanted)  
Oh, oh, oh, I would not care  
Sometimes I'd win (you win, you win)  
  
Sometimes (sometimes) I'd lose, oh, wee  
I could change the world [if I could change the world]  
If I had you [by my side]  
I could change the world [if I could change the world]  
  
If I had you (by my side, yeah)  
My momma told me not to worry (I don't cheating)  
She said "It'll all come to those who wait"  
(Come to you and you won't be wait)  
  
But as I wait, I feel, oh, no  
That it's much too late  
That's why (never too late, baby)  
I could change the world [if I could change the world]  
  
(Change the world)  
If I had you (ooh, you, if I had you)  
I could change the world [if I could change the world]  
(If I could change the world)  
  
If I had you (only you) by my side (yeah) by my side  
If I could change the world  
(If I had you?ooh?)  
If I could change the world (ooh)  
  
(I could change the world)  
Oh, yeah  
I could change the world [if I could change the world]  
If I had you (just me and you, just me and you, baby, yeah) [by my side]  
  
I (ooh, ooh) could change the world [if I could change the world]  
(Whatever you wanted)  
If I had you (oh, yeah, if I had you) oh, yeah  
I could change the world (oh)  
  
If I had you (if I had you)  
I could change the world (never, never too late now, no, no)  
If I had you, oh, yeah  
I (oh, yeah, yeah) could change the world  
  
(I could change the world, I could change the world)  
If I had you (if I only, if I only)  
I could change the world  
(I could change the world, I could change the world)  
  
If I had you (by my side, oh, yeah) [yeah]  
I could change the world  
[Oh, you, whatever you need, I gave what you need]  
(I could change the world)  
  
If I had you  
I could change the world  
(I could change the world) [could change the world, yeah, yeah]  
If I had you (if I get you) [oh, yeah, yeah]  
  
I [ooh, ooh] could change the world (I could change the world)  
If I had you (if I had, if I get you)  
I?
