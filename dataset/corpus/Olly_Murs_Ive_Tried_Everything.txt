I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
  
Ooh ooh ooh (I'd try anything, to get you off my mind)  
  
We used to climb Primrose Hill  
When it was just the two of us  
We used to run up the stairs  
On the double-decker bus  
And oh, I can't do that anymore  
No, it just reminds me of before  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
I see a girl across the street  
On a sunny afternoon  
And if I look through half-closed eyes  
She looks a bit like you  
Oh, it just reminds me of before  
No, I can't do that anymore  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
All my days are messed up  
Can't break down, can't break up  
Sleepless nights that never end  
I wish I could pretend  
Oh, I can't do this anymore  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
Ooh ooh ooh (Anything anything baby, to get you off my mind)  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough
