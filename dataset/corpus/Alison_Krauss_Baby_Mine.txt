Baby mine, don't you cry  
Baby mine, dry your eyes  
Rest your head close to my heart  
Never to part  
Baby of mine  
  
Little one, when you play  
Don't you mind what they say  
Let those eyes sparkle and shine  
Never a tear  
Baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All of those people who scold you  
What they'd give just for the right to hold you  
  
From your head, down to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Sweet as can be  
Baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All those same people who scold you  
What they'd give just for the right to hold you  
  
From your head, down to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Sweet as can be  
Baby of mine  
Baby of mine
