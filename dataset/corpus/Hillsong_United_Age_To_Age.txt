[Verse 1]  
You gave me hope you made me whole at the cross.  
You took my place you showed me grace.  
At the cross where you died for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
And his glory appears like the light from the sun  
Age to age he shines look to the skies hear the angels cry.  
Saying holy is the Lord.  
  
[Verse 2]  
You gave me hope you made me whole at the cross.  
You took my place you showed me grace  
At the cross where you died for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
And his glory appears like the light from the sun.  
Age to age he shines look to the skies here the angels cry.  
Saying holy is the Lord.
