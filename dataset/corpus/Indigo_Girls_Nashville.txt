As I drive  
From your pearly gates  
I realize that I just can't stay  
All those mountains  
They kept you locked inside  
And hid the truth  
From my slighted eyes  
  
I came to you with a half-open heart  
Dreams upon my back  
Illusions of a brand new start  
Nashville  
Can't I carry the load  
Is it my fault that  
I can't reap what I sow  
Nashville  
Did you give me half a chance  
With your southern style  
And your hidden dance away  
You dance away  
And you dance away  
  
All these voices  
They whisper through my walls  
They talk of falling fast  
They say I'm losing it all  
They say I'm running blind  
To love of my own  
But I'll be walking proud  
I'm saving what I still own  
  
I fell on my knees to kiss your land  
But you are so far down  
And I can't even see to stand  
In nashville  
You forgot the human race  
You see with half a mind  
What colors hide the face  
Nashville  
I'd like to know your fate  
I'd like to stay a while  
But I've seen your lowered states today  
I've seen 'em today  
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today  
  
Now I'm leaving  
I've got all these debts to pay  
You know we all have our dues  
I'll pay 'em some other place  
Ah I never ask that you pay me back  
We all arrive with more  
I left with less than I had  
  
Your town is made for people passing through  
A last chance for a cause  
I thought I knew  
But nashville  
You tell me what you are gonna do  
With all your southern style  
It'll never pull you through  
Nashville  
I can't place no blame  
But if you forget my face  
I'll never call your name again  
No never again  
No never again  
  
I fell on my knees to kiss your land  
But you are so far down  
And I can't even see to stand  
In nashville  
You forgot the human race  
You see with half a mind  
What colors hide the face  
Nashville  
I'd like to know your fate  
I'd like to stay a while  
But I've seen your lowered states today  
I've seen 'em today  
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today  
I'm running away I'm running away  
I'm running I'm running  
I'm running away
