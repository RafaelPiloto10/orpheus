In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes  
With the freighters towering over me  
I can hear the jets flying overhead  
Making lines across the darkening sky  
  
And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town  
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
  
So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you  
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free  
And I could get away from you  
And you could get away from me  
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
  
In a CD karaoke bar  
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus  
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"  
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians  
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits  
  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
(Spinning round)  
  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
(Spinning round)  
  
(I don't know)  
Why you say you are not in love with me  
(I don't know)  
Why you say you are not in love with me  
(I don't know)
