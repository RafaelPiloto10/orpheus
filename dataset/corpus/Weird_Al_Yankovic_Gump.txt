Gump sat alone on a bench in the park  
"My name is Forrest," he'd casually remark  
Waitin' for the bus with his hands in his pockets  
He just kept sayin' life is like a box of chocolates  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
What's in his head?  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
Is he inbred?  
Gump was a big celebrity  
He told JFK that he really had to pee  
He never feels too dumb because  
His mom always told him stupid is as stupid does  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
He's kinda square  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
What's with that hair?  
Run... run... run, run, now  
Forrest Run... run... run like the wind now  
Run... run... run, run, now  
Forrest Run... stop!  
His buddy Bubba was a shrimp-lovin' man  
His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan  
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut  
He went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
He's not too bright  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
But he's all right  
Is this Gump out of his head?  
I think so  
Is this Gump really brain dead?  
I think so  
Did this Gump make lots of bread?  
I think so  
And that's all I have to say about that
