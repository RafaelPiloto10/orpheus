Don't close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
My image bends its shape  
I'll be written on the wind  
Like in every sailer's dreams  
Heading for the moon  
I reach out (echoes)  
My pulse begins to race (echoes)  
The crashing sounds  
Of fears I've never faced  
Let them echo off these waves  
With thoughts as brave as they once were  
Heading for the moon  
And, look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind, oh  
Heading for the moon  
Don't close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
Of never ending shapes  
I'll be wishing off the blue  
I'll still want to send my stars  
Heading for the moon  
And, look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind, oh  
Heading for the moon  
Ha ha  
Heading for the moon  
So don't close your eyes  
Heading for the moon  
Over the white  
Your shadows may chase from behind  
You might just put them out of your mind  
Heading for the moon
