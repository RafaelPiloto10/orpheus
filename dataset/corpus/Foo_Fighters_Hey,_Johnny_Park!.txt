Come and I'll take you under  
This beautiful bruises colors  
Everything fades in time, it's true  
  
Wish that I had another  
Stab at the under cover  
Was it a change in mind for you?  
  
It's impossible  
I can't let it out  
You'll never know  
Am I selling you out?  
Sit and watch  
Your every mood  
  
Your eyes still remind me of  
Angels that hover above  
Eyes that can change from blind to blue  
  
Now that I've found my reward  
Throw it away long before  
I'd share a piece of mine with you
