Blue I dress for every situation  
Moving through the doorway of the nation  
Pick me up and shake me down  
Baby I can't do without  
  
Move out  
Don't mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
  
Move out  
Forget about don't make a sound  
Just move out  
I remember only for an hour  
  
Moving right through me can you feel the power  
I don't know what's going on  
It's getting me but it won't be long  
Move out  
  
Don't mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
Move out  
  
Forget about don't make a sound  
Just move out  
Move out  
Don't mess around  
  
Move out  
You bring me down  
Move out  
Forget about don't make a sound  
  
Just move out  
Move out  
Don't mess around  
Move out  
  
You bring me down  
Move out  
Forget about don't make a sound  
Just move out  
  
Now he's in control he is your lover  
Nation stands against him he's your brother  
Been a long time, been a long time  
Now I've got to give somehow  
  
Move out  
Don't mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
  
Move out  
Forget about don't make a sound  
Just move out  
Well Well Well
