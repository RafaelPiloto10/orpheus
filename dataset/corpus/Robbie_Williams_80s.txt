I smoked Consulates and Park Drive, drank Nookie Brown  
Learned how to skive  
Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum  
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun  
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some  
Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son  
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done  
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didn't have an answer  
Rhythm was a dancer  
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!  
I wore a troop track suit, British Knights shoes, Kangol hat like LL Cool's  
Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large  
They nicked the BMX from out my garage  
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me, he'd smile
like we were mates  
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's  
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams  
Like a hooligan on the football stands  
And I'd throw the v's to Leeds and West Ham  
Then I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay  
Then I ran again cuz I couldn't pay, a Muslim didn't get his fare that day  
I apologize today  
  
Things are better when they start  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
  
And who are you calling poof? You like Wham, man, I hate that stuff  
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had
to nanny me  
School was a laugh, they didn't have ADD, thick was the term they used for me  
(over and over)  
Repeatedly  
(over and over)  
  
Take my breath away take my breath away  
Bidly bidly bidly bong  
Pass it on the left hand side, right turn, Clyde  
  
That girl in the fourth year, got pregnant and she was raised Catholic,
brilliant!  
I cried, she cried, we cried, her youth died  
Drank cider in the cemetery  
The year above us had discovered E and I said it weren't for me  
?12.50? I could rob me mum's purse and buy one off chalcky  
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday  
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday  
Dumped by Sunday  
  
Things are better when they start  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
The wonder years, I've played my part  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
  
Like I said, I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie, well she said
she fancied me  
And then she said "fuck me" and I thought 'fuck me, I'm all talk and it'll be
over too quickly'  
And it was but I couldn't care less, I'd seen a girl's part,made a mess on her
dress, oh yes!  
You're now rocking with the best, second person in my year that had seen a
breast  
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed  
Where are the Falklands mum? And what have they done?  
Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from?  
  
It's the 80s, what you looking at, ya mong?  
So young, so long, so young, so long  
Too short, so long  
What you looking at ya mong?  
Too short, so long, too short, so long  
So long.
