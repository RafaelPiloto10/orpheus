Twelve hours a day ain't such a long time  
It's only a means to an end  
He thinks that his pay will buy her devotion  
But he's only payin' for her to pretend  
  
What more can he do but give her his heart  
Wrapped up in a love so sincere  
Lookin' around at all that they have  
It seems clear  
  
That it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No it's never enough, never never enough  
It's so sad  
  
Is anything ever enough?  
She ran out of time for people who loved her  
Their love couldn't get her nowhere  
Isn't it sad she started collecting  
  
Friends who are strangers but she doesn't care  
Surrounding herself with phonies and fools  
Who tell her what she wants to hear  
Looking around at all that they have it seems clear  
  
That it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No it's never enough, never never enough  
It's so sad  
  
Is anything ever enough?  
Why must we want so much more than we have?  
Will we never be satisfied?  
Just look around  
  
How can we feel so denied?  
But it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No, it's never enough, never never enough  
  
It's so sad  
Is anything ever enough?  
Enough
