Non-stop dancing, truly out on the floor  
Non-stop moving, baby, baby  
Still you scream out for more  
We don't care if it rains or shines  
Cause everything's fine inside, when we're dancing  
Non-stop dancing  
I said, non-stop loving, with my girl by my side  
Everything's just cool, now baby, baby  
She's the sweetest thing I know  
I don't even mind guys trying to compete  
I know our love's as strong as the beat, when we're dancing  
Non-stop dancing  
People say we're wasting our time  
They don't seem to understand  
Cause when you're dancing all night long  
It gives you the feeling that you belong  
Non-stop dancing, I'm truly out of my head  
But I ain't sleepy, baby, baby  
You see the dance is my bed  
Things are really getting wild  
The kids are screaming for that James Brown style, when we're dancing  
Non-stop dancing
