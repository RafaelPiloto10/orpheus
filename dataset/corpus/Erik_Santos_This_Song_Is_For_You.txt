If only a song could capture a memory  
I would be with you  
If only a heart could fall for a melody  
I know you'd love me too  
  
But a song is just a song  
And a melody won't do  
If you don't belong to me  
In the way I'd want you to  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
I'd always remember  
The way you are to me  
And that's how you'd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
If only a dream could be realized  
I'd have you here with me  
Here in my arms  
Here in my life  
The way it's meant to be  
  
But I've had enough of dreaming  
Of a life I'd never have  
If you don't belong to me  
I guess I'd have to live with that  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
I'd always remember  
The way you are to me  
And that's how you'd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
For as long as you know  
This song is for you
