[Chorus]  
Going nowhere fast  
We've reached the climax  
We're together, now we're undone  
Won't commit so we choose to  
Run away  
Do we separate? Oh  
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up  
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax  
Climax  
  
I've fallen somehow  
Feet off the ground  
Love is the cloud  
That keeps raining down  
Where are you now?  
When I need you around  
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gave my best, it wasn't enough  
You get upset, we argue too much  
We made a mess of what used to be love  
So why do I care, I care at all  
At all  
At all  
At all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say it's better if we  
Love each other separately  
I just need you one more time  
I can't get what we had out my mind  
Where are you now  
When I need you around  
I'm on my knees  
But it seems we're going  
  
[Chorus]
