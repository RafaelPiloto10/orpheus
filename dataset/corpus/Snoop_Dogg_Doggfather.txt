I put down more hits than mafioso made  
And Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano  
And I know, I know the way you feel  
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real  
  
Just to get you caught up in amazement  
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous  
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack  
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha  
  
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan  
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo,  
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes  
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's  
  
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga  
I'm Tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)  
  
Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)  
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)  
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance  
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance  
  
I'm so fly like a dove  
I come from up above  
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love  
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em  
  
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom  
I delete em, but don't mistreat em  
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on,  
Let me flow on  
  
You can rock to tha rythme you see  
or you can rock to tha rythme of me  
Just remember when you do your thang,  
Make sure you do your thang on a hang  
  
And everythang, is everythang  
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase  
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case  
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,  
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost  
I'm Tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, do anybody in tha house remember  
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)  
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC  
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)  
  
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop  
Have prestigious women  
That's the truth from the beginning  
In and out of the flyest hotels  
  
You say your family don't know me  
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos  
Sales, tails, scales and jails  
Success before death  
  
No one in my clique fails  
As females with the almighty Father lead  
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need  
And it ain't no party like this kind,  
  
'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind  
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind  
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and  
I'm tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus until fade]
