Hear what I'm saying, you're losing control  
Can't take the sun from her eyes  
She's built for comfort, she ain't no fool  
She said, take a look  
It's easy tonight  
It's gonna be alright  
She made me feel alright  
Baby baby baby baby, feel alright, wooh  
Yeah, it's gonna be alright  
A flaming sky sure makes her look good  
You'll put your life on the line  
Are you gonna stay, or do you wanna leave  
Well hey, come with me  
We'll have a good time  
It's gonna be alright  
Yeah, she made me feel alright  
Baby baby baby baby, feel alright, yeah  
Yeah, it's gonna be alright  
I can't wait  
I gotta have her now  
I can't wait  
Well my love is growing stronger, yeah  
I can't wait  
No, no, no, no  
It's alright  
Baby baby baby baby  
She made me feel alright  
Yeah, she made me feel alright  
Well baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright  
Baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright  
It's gonna be alright  
She made me feel alright
