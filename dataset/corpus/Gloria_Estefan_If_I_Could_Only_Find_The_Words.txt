So many songs talk about love  
Written by those who never  
Felt it's touch  
And then there are lines  
With poetry rhyme  
By those who have known but  
Never said much  
And here I am  
Trying to get you make into my world  
Trying to get that feeling known to you  
If I could only find the words  
Typical lines  
Usual games  
I new what to say then  
  
To get my own way  
I knew it was wrong  
I acted untrue  
But I would trade forever  
For a yesterday with you  
And here I am trying to get  
You back into my world  
Trying to get that feeling known to you  
If I could only find the words  
If I could only find the words  
I knew it was wrong  
I acted untrue  
But I would trade forever  
For a yesterday with you  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
If I could only find the words
