Pickin' wasn't easy  
Kept you brown and thin  
Been a child for every season  
That the fruit was on the limb  
  
Pack the truck Maria  
Tell the kids, we're off again  
Cross a dozen states or more  
We'll teach 'em what we can  
  
Teach 'em what we can  
We can't do more  
The land is good  
But still the livin's poor  
  
Harvest in September  
Drought in mid July  
January's peeking  
Through a white lace gypsy sky  
  
March rolls into April  
Then plant and pray for rain  
Sweat like hell in August  
Run the circle once again  
  
Run the circle once again  
And then once more  
The land is good  
But still the livin's poor  
  
Oregon in August  
Michigan in May  
Tryin' to make enough  
To keep my family on its way  
  
And buy the pickin' boss a drink  
To keep working every day  
You know it isn't honest  
But you do it anyway  
  
Do it anyway  
To keep alive  
Do it anyway to keep alive
