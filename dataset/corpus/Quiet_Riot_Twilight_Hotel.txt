Midnight masquerade  
Innocent fantasies  
Never ended from room to room  
Dressed up for sharades  
Every guest has a part to play  
And the rules are understood  
Undercover  
A secret rendez-vous  
They won't discover  
That it's me and it's you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
Last call at the bar  
Fast talkin' it promises  
Never really reaching the lines  
Seems to bizarre  
Such a twisted reality  
This place full of manic minds  
It's like a dreamland  
With time standing still  
So make your big plans  
They've got all the frills  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
It's a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes  
Undercover  
A secret rendez-vous  
They won't discover  
That it's me and it's you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
It's a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes
