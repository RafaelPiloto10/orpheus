For the beauty of the earth,  
For the beauty of the skies,  
For the love which from our birth  
Over and around us lies,  
Lord of all, to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise.  
  
For the beauty of each hour  
Of the day and of the night,  
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,  
Sun and moon and stars of light,  
Lord of all, to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise.  
  
For the joy of human love,  
Brother, sister, parent, child,  
Friends on earth, and friends above,  
Pleasures pure and undefiled,  
Lord of all, to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise.  
  
For each perfect gift of thine,  
To our race so freely given,  
Graces human and divine,  
Flowers of earth and buds of heaven,  
Lord of all, to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise.  
  
For thy Church which evermore  
Lifteth holy hands above,  
Offering up on every shore  
Her pure sacrifice of love,  
Lord of all, to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise.
