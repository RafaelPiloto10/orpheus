The day outside is warm, the sun is shinin' bright  
But since you're gone, the time is wrong  
It's a twenty-four hour night  
My heart is filled with bloom, my soul has lost it's light  
I sit here in my lonely room, it's a twenty-four hour night  
My life is an endless torture, cold and bare and black  
You know how much I want you  
Please, please, please come back  
Come back and take my heart, come make this darkness bright  
Come back again and please, please end  
These twenty-four hour nights, twenty-four hour nights
