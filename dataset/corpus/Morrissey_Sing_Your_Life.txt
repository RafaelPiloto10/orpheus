Sing your life  
Any fool can think of words that rhyme  
Many others do  
Why don't you?  
Do you want to?  
Oh...  
Sing your life  
Walk right up to the microphone  
And name  
All the things you love  
All the things that you loathe  
  
Oh, sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe  
Oh, sing your life  
Oh, sing your life  
  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
  
Others sang your life  
But now is a chance to shine  
And have the pleasure of  
Saying what you mean  
Have the pleasure of  
Meaning what you sing  
Oh, make no mistake my friend  
All of this will end  
So sing it now (sing your life)  
All the things you love (sing your life)  
All the things you loathe  
Oh, sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe (sing your life)  
Oh, sing oh...  
Oh, sing oh...  
  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
  
Don't leave it all unsaid  
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head, oh  
Head, oh, head, oh, head, oh  
And make no mistake, my friend  
Your pointless life will end  
But before you go  
Can you look at the truth ?  
You have a lovely singing voice  
A lovely singing voice  
And all of those  
Who sing on-key  
They stole the notion  
From you and me  
So, sing your life (sing your life)  
Sing your life (sing your life)  
Oh, sing your oh...  
Oh, sing your  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Oh, sing your oh...  
(Sing your life)  
(Sing your life)  
Sing your life  
(Sing your life)
