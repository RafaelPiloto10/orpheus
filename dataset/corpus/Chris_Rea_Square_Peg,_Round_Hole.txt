He's a square peg in a round hole  
Misfit in a slick world  
Don't play the game  
Don't do what he's told  
He's a square peg in a round hole  
  
Square peg don't care  
The bright lights he's not there  
Catch the shadows see him slip away  
Square peg that's what they say  
Square peg, Square peg  
  
Square peg, you have got to be strong  
Square peg, he's got his own song  
Square peg, I'll see you around  
Square peg, face down  
  
Square peg, round hole
