What you mean, wanna know how I feel about you, baby?  
Be poetic about it, alright  
  
I love the east, I love the west  
And north and south, they're both the best  
But I'll only go there as a guest  
'Cause I love being here with you  
  
I love the sea, I love the shore  
I love the rocks but what is more?  
With you they'd never be a bore  
'Cause I love being here with you  
  
Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour  
Life is such a breezy game  
Love all kinds of weather, as long we're together  
I love to hear you say my name  
  
I like good wine and fine cuisine  
And candle light, I like the scene  
But baby, if you know what I mean  
'Cause I love being here with you  
I love being here with you  
  
I like a dance by Fred Astaire  
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair  
But I think to tell you's only fair  
That I love being here with you  
  
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day  
His utter charm takes me away  
But don't get me wrong, how do you say  
I love being here with you  
  
Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin'  
'Cause there's something else, you know  
They know how to say it, they know how to play it  
They wind it up and let it go  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows  
I'd love to Durante's nose  
But I'd like to say before I close, yeah, yeah  
I just love, baby I love, well, I love being here with you
