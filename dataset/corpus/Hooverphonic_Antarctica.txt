All I have is strictly forbidden  
And all I have is strictly insane  
We know what we want  
But that's not always good for us  
Insanity is not always despair  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
We all fall into oblivion  
And history slowly fades  
What's done doesn't matter  
What matter's not done  
All we have, belongs to no one  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind
