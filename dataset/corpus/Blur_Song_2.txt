Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  
  
I got my head checked  
By a jumbo jet  
It wasn't easy  
But nothing is  
No  
  
Woo-hoo  
When I feel heavy-metal  
(Woo-hoo)  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo)  
Well, I lie and I'm easy  
All the time but I'm never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
  
I got my head down  
When I was young  
It's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
  
Woo-hoo  
When I feel heavy-metal  
(Woo-hoo)  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo)  
Well, I lie and I'm easy  
All the time but I am never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Oh yeah
