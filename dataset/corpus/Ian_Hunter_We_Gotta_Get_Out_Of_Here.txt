It's such a small town rodeo  
Such famous people here, with nowhere to go  
Well it don't get to me, i think it's the pits  
I got no friends, i want to split.  
  
The daily papers seek a desperate face  
The television cameras join in the chase  
It's much fun interviewing urban decay  
I grab the microphone away  
  
(dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no!  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
  
Hey rock and roll feel the holes in my brain  
I promise you i'll never come here again  
It's all so sad, what a waste of a night  
Cause nothing's wrong, but nothing's right (hey)  
  
So don't get along, out of my way  
I'm not a robot, i've got something to say  
It's such a joke, are you ready to go  
Here comes that beat again, oh oh oh oh  
  
(dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no!  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
[repeat while ellen speaks]  
  
(oh please i don't want to go home yet  
Come on, can't you do anything i want to do?  
Lets dance, come on please, just once for me  
I never get to do anything like this  
You're such a drag, you know that?  
Everything for you, everything for you, nothing for me, right  
What are we gonna do? go home and watch the super bowl  
Re-runs of the mohammed ali uh marlene dietrich fight, what?  
There must be somebody here who wants to dance with me  
There must be a lot of people here who would like to dance with me, you know  
That?  
Come on, one, two, three, four - i'll jump right up and do the bump(?), come
on  
  
Listen this place gets really good, this place gets really.....  
I heard that the that the the spoon comes down and the moon comes down and  
The stars and all sorts of great stuff happens in a little while).
