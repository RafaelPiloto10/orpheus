Believe me, pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night  
  
Believe me, pretty mama  
Better take your picture too  
Don't want to remember  
What a good looking girl can do  
Don't send me no letter  
Don't write me no postcard  
Thinking about you, baby  
Makes it twice as hard  
Believe me, pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night  
Well I'm sitting here  
On the sudden(? )  
Watching the trees go by  
My baby, at the end of the depot(? )  
Lay me down and cry  
Believe me, pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night
