Here you are right by my side  
Words cannot express how I feel  
Being this close to you  
Heaven seems much nearer in your eyes  
I wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
I can see your face and I start to trembling all inside  
Don't know why but it's true  
We're so close and yet so far away  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Let's forget about the tears we've cried  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Let's forget about our foolish pride  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  
Here we are together now  
Wanting you but don't know how  
Knowing I care for you  
Even if we have to start all over again  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Let's forget about the tears we've cried  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Let's forget about our foolish pride  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
Open up and let my light inside  
I just want to be your friend  
Let's forget about the tears we've cried  
Darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
(Open up and let my light inside) Oh -  
(I just want to be your friend) I just want to be your friend  
(Let's forget about the tears we cried)  
Ooh, hoo my darling I just want to love you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart  
(Open up and let my light inside) open up, let my light inside  
(I just want to be your friend) I just want to be your friend  
(Let's forget about our foolish pride) ooh, hoo my darling I just want to love
you  
Wish that I could touch your lonely heart...
