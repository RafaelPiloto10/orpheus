I'm coming home  
I've been away far too long  
I'm leaving it up to you  
To understand  
  
You may wonder why  
When it was me who said  
The last goodbye  
But cannot change my mind  
One more time  
  
It's high time  
I can't wait any longer  
It's my time to find out  
Who I belong to  
It's breaking my heart  
Waitin' for another day  
  
When the time comes  
You won't see me around  
I've been patient  
Standing my ground  
Gotta see ya and hold ya  
Hear what you have to say  
  
Do you wake up in the morning  
Wantin' me  
The way I wake up wantin' you  
And in the same breath  
You keep hauntin' me  
Does it ever occur to you  
I've been in love too long  
To stop now, oh  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
  
If you've ever cried  
Then you'll know the pain  
You felt inside  
And just like me you pray  
It's all untrue  
  
But time alone will tell  
If you have learned  
Life's lessons well  
And maybe then you'll know  
What I should do  
  
Been away, I've been away  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
Too long, much too long  
Much too long
