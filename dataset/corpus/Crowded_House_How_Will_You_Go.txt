Escape is on your mind again  
Escape to a far away land  
At times it seems there is no end  
To long hard nights of drinking  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
I fell over on the couch again  
But you know not all sleep is wasted  
Your dreams are alcohol inspired  
I can't find a better way to face it  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
And you know I'll be fine  
Just don't ask me how it's going  
Gimme time, gimme time  
'Cause I want you to see  
Round the world, round the world  
Is a tangled up necklace of pearls  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in
