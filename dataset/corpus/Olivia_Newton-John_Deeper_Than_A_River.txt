Some people search a lifetime  
For a love to stand the test of time  
But you don't have to worry  
You've got someone  
Who will always be right by your side  
  
Oh  
I've got a love  
Got a love that won't end  
Here in my heart, baby  
I've got a love  
  
[Chorus:]  
So deep, deeper than a river  
So high, higher than any mountain  
So strong, strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is, this love is, this love is deeper than a river, yeah  
  
Oh yeah  
Just like a tree that stands tall  
Darling I'll stand by you through it all  
There's nothing gonna stop me from loving you  
I will always be right by your side  
  
You've got a love, got a love for all time  
Here in my arms baby  
I've got a love, got a love than won't die  
Here in my heart baby  
I've got a love  
  
[Chorus]  
So deep, deeper than a river  
So high, higher than any mountain  
So strong, strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is, this love is, this love is deeper than a river, yeah  
  
Like a river needs the sea, I need you with me  
Every minute of my life, oh yeah  
And like the sunlight needs the sky  
I need you by my side  
This love of mine  
Is so deep, baby, is so deep baby, oh, so deep baby  
Oh I've got a love  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on and on and on, yeah  
(This love is) you know (this love is) this love is deeper than a river
