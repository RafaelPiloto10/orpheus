Jesus commands us to go,  
  
But we go the other way.  
  
So he carries the burden alone,  
  
While his children are busy at play,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh, how God grieves and believes that the world can't be saved,  
  
Unless the ones he's appointed obeys,  
  
His command and his stand for the world,  
  
That he loved more than life.  
  
Oh he died, and he cries out tonight.  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When his church refuses to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh how God comes, as he starts the great judgment of fire,  
  
So he can gain, his greatest desire.  
  
Cause he knows that the souls of the lost,  
  
They can only be reached, through us,  
  
We're his hands and his feet.  
  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When god's children refuse to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.
