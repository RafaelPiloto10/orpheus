Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man?  
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?  
Oh, but the longer love I give you it's never enough  
And I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough  
So come on, come on, come on, come on  
And take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby  
Break it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey  
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
(If it makes you feel good)  
You're out on the street looking good  
Oh, you know, you deep down in your heart that it ain't right  
You never ever hear me, you never hear me when I, when I cry at night  
Oh, but each time I tell myself I just can't stand the pain  
(I can't stand)  
But when you hold me in your arms I've seen [Incomprehensible]  
Again and again, and again  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby  
Break it, break another little bit of my heart now, honey  
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby  
Break it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey  
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good
