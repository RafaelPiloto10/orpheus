Christmas time  
Comes once a year  
Christmas time's  
The time that all should bring  
Good cheer  
Once a year  
  
Oh, Christmas bells  
They keep ringing  
Little children  
Are singing  
Waiting for  
Dear old Santa  
To bring all the toys  
For girls and boys  
  
Christmas time  
Comes once a year  
Christmas time's  
The time that all should bring  
Good cheer  
Once a year  
  
Christmas cards  
To send away  
To the ones  
Who brought us  
Still our friends  
Once a year  
  
Christmas bells  
They keep ringing  
Little children  
Are singing  
Waiting for  
Dear old Santa  
To bring all the toys  
For girls and boys  
  
Ding-a-ling-a-ling  
The Christmas bells will ring  
Ding-a-ling-a-ling  
The day has come  
It's Christmas time  
Once a year  
  
Ding-a-ling-a-ling
