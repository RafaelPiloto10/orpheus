Too late, too late, too late  
I'm tired of your deceivin' and I can't statd your creepin', I'm gone  
I'm tired of your deceivin' and I can't stand your creepin', I'm gone  
  
Too late, too late, too late  
Tired of all the fussin' and I can't stand your cursin', I'm gone  
Tired of all the fussin' and I can't stand your cursin', I'm gone  
  
Gee you know I love you  
I don't know just why  
Thought the whole world of you  
But today I say bye-bye, bye-bye  
  
Too late, too late, too late  
Can't stand your cookin' and you ain't good-lookin', I'm gone  
Can't stand your cookin' and you ain't good-lookin', I'm gone  
  
Gee you know I love you  
I don't know just why  
Thought the whole world of you  
But today I say bye-bye, bye-bye  
  
Too late, too late, too late  
Can't stand your beatin' and I know you been cheatin', I'm gone  
Can't stand your beatin' and I know you been cheatin', I'm gone  
Can't stand your beatin' and I know you been cheatin', I'm gone
