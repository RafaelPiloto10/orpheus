Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes  
I don't know if even Heaven knows  
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true  
Now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
I know people hurt you, so bad  
They don't know the damage they can do,  
And it makes me so sad  
How we knock each other down just like  
Children on a playground  
Even after that ol' sun went down  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Or blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
Oh darlin', baby, this is still a shady little town  
And sometimes it's so hard to smile  
For the world, for the camera  
And still have something left  
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody  
Just take good care of yourself  
  
I'm not easy to live with  
I know that it's true  
You're no picnic either, babe  
That's one of the things I loved about you  
Time will come around when we need to settle down  
Got to get of this merry-go-round  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking you're light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
Not enough love in the world  
In the world  
In the world  
In the world
