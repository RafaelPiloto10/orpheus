It's in your eyes--here we go again  
Tonight you're gonna come on strong  
Such a cryin' shame--the time we spend  
Over who's been right and who's been wrong  
  
There'll be no pretending this time  
Your eyes are like fire  
You'll swear it's the end of the line  
But you and I we both know you're a liar  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Don't tell me that we're through  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Don't try and tell me that it's over  
It isn't true  
Don't tell me that it's over  
'Cause you can't say goodbye any more  
Than I can walk away from you  
  
You say it's hard to love a man like me  
But, baby, now and then  
You do your fair share so easily  
You can push me to my limit  
And back again  
  
Just when I can't take anymore  
And I've made up my mind  
I say I'm ready to walk out the door  
But somethin' keeps me from leavin' you behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a reason why  
After we've tried  
We're not runnin' to the arms of another  
  
When all comes down  
We both know by now  
We just still mean too much to each other  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me it's over
