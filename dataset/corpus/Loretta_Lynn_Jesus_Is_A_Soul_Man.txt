Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
And I'm sure sold on Him  
  
Oh, they say that He's a square  
That Jesus, He ain't nowhere  
I know better, He lives in my heart  
Jesus is a soul man  
  
You can find Him in the Bible pages  
Jesus, He's the rock of ages  
He hides me in the cleft of the rock  
Jesus is a soul man  
  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
And I'm sure sold on Him  
  
He calms the waves when the storm is ragin'  
Keep me safe when the Devil's ravin'  
He's my staff, He's my sword and my shield  
Jesus is a soul man  
  
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego  
The king, he said, in the fire they must go  
He found out that the fire wouldn't burn 'em  
They were saved by the soul man  
  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
And I'm sure sold on Him  
  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
My Jesus is a soul man  
And I'm sure sold on Him
