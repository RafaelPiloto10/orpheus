There's something I have to tell you  
Before it's too late  
There's someone needs a timing  
I could be the same  
Got to listen to you clearly  
Would you understand it all  
Would you hold it all together  
Do we run up in the bar  
  
Everyone needs someone to listen to  
If you don't want to shine on  
Could you know it all  
And if someone lay before you know it could be true  
A voice in the crowd  
  
You came upon an  
Just an alibi  
Did you have to go do it  
To feel you want to try  
If you'd only see the reason  
Someone came, someone rose, someone left  
  
I don't know if you could be sure  
You don't understand  
And if the days were good  
You never know the way we planned  
And if the time is there  
A voice in the crowd  
A voice in the crowd
