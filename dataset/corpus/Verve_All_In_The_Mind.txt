So I got in the car  
We drove for a mile  
I didn't even learn her name  
She said: "You've got the money and I've got the time"  
  
Five years later on  
She became my lover  
Taught me everything I know  
She said: "You were born to fly my son"  
I said: "Hey! I already know"  
  
Because it's all inside  
Because it's all inside  
I was born to fly, fly pretty high  
  
Five years later on  
She became my father  
Taught me everything I know  
She said: "You were born to burn my love"  
I said: "Hey! I already know"  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
So waste your time  
On people who don't know which way to go  
They'll never said you were, never said  
You were up in the sky  
Because it's all in the mind  
  
Just get in the car  
Turn out the light  
Don't care who you are  
You could be a star  
Or you could be a fool  
Don't care what I find  
It's all in the mind
