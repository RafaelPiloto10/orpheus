Ride, ride my see-saw,  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me.  
  
Ride, take a free ride,  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
It's for free.  
  
I worked like a slave for years,  
Sweat so hard just to end my fears.  
Not to end my life a poor man,  
But by now, I know I should have run.  
  
Run, run my last race,  
Take my place  
Have this number  
Of mine.  
  
Run, run like a fire,  
Don't you run in  
In the lanes  
Run for time.  
  
Left school with a first class pass,  
Started work but as second class.  
School taught one and one is two.  
But right now, that answer just ain't true.  
  
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah  
  
My world is spinning around,  
Everything is lost that I found.  
People run, come ride with me,  
Let's find another place that's free.  
  
Ride, ride my see-saw,  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me.  
  
Ride, take a free ride,  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
It's for free.  
  
Ride, my see-saw.  
Ride, ride, ride, my see-saw.  
Ride, my see-saw...
