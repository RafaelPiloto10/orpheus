When you went away I cried  
Cried for so long  
And I wanted you to stay  
Ah but that was all wrong  
  
The pain you left behind  
Has become part of me  
And it's burned out a hole  
Where my love used to be  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it's not losing you  
That's got me down so low  
I just can't find another man  
To take your place  
  
Well you know I love you  
But that wasn't enough  
We both fell apart  
When things got too tough  
And I've learned how to give now  
But what good  
But what good would that do  
No one can touch me  
The way you used to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know your opinion  
Of me is not good  
Please try to understand  
That I'd change  
Well I'd change if I could  
And this coldness inside me  
Well it's starting to build  
And a woman can't be a woman  
Unless she's fulfilled  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no one can
