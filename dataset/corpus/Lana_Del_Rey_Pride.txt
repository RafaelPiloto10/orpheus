You have this way of making me say the opposite of everything I mean  
I kiss you, I hug you, but I could not feel less connected from you!  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I could... not so happy time of your life.  
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride  
I don't quit fit the part of... everything and falls into insanity.  
The sun beams, mean nothing if you can't find the light shining in one thing  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I got you, and I'm not so happy... time of your life  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride.  
It's fine if you're hateful, as long as you remain grateful  
It made me nervous... like me I really tried  
The way I'm feeling in this moment it can't last my whole life!  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride! aa
