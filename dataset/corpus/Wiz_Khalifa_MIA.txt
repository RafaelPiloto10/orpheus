[Intro]  
  
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]  
I be overseas, I be in L.A  
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day  
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray  
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid  
I be overseas, I be in LA  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread  
I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed  
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne  
I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn gang  
I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion  
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action  
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new  
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryin' to do  
I brought the whole thing so that's what I'mma smoke  
I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke  
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak  
Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Juicy J]  
On vacation weed in rotation  
Relaxation, trippy nation  
Chasing bands, model chicks  
Look like Sports Illustrated  
I'm getting high as a plane  
With no final destination  
On that gin, on that Hen  
And that lean intoxication  
Rocking dollars, rocking gold  
Money tall like Manute Bol  
In a presidential suite  
With some playmates in a fold  
Niggas out here chasing ass  
When they should be chasing cash  
I be smoking til it's gone  
Juicy J don't waste no gas  
With her legs lift up  
I thought it was a stick up  
Should've seen them hoes that pick up  
Bands hard to lift up  
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee  
They call me the money tree  
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Outro]  
You already know what it is Nigga  
It's that Cabin Fever 2  
Shout out to everybody who got the first Cabin Fever  
If you're listening to this right now  
You're probably on the 2050 tour wit us  
So welcome to that  
It's TGOD man, we smoke footlong joints  
Nothin' but KK and cookies all day  
Pittsburgh in this bitch  
Every time that we hit man, I know y'all in this bitch  
So what we goin do is roll another joint, keep this thing going  
It's Cabin Fever, 2050

Taylor Gang album, let's get it
