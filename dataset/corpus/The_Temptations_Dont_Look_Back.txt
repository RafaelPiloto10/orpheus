If it's love that you're running from  
There's no hiding place  
(You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it)  
Love has problems I know but there problems  
We'll just have to face  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
If you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
We're gonna walk and don't look back  
(Don't look back)  
And don't look back, oh yeah yeah  
And don't look back baby  
(Don't look back)  
(The places behind you, let them remind you)  
  
If your first lover broke your heart  
There's something that can be done  
(You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it)  
Don't end your faith in love  
Because of what he's done  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on walking and don't look back  
Forget about the past now  
Don't look back, baby  
Keep on walking and don't look back. Hmmm  
(The places behind you, let them remind you)  
  
Love can be a beautiful thing  
Though your first love let you down  
Oh yeah, yeah  
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby  
The second time around  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on pushing and don't look back  
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl  
Keep on walking and won't look back  
Forget about the past now, baby  
And don't look back  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back.
