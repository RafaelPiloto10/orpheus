Gettin' soaking wet  
And it's raining, y'all  
Been put out, y'all  
Nowhere to go, children  
People all ask me, son  
Tell me what's wrong with you  
Tell 'em I've been sick, y'all, yeah  
Yes, I've been sick, children, yeah  
  
My baby got me  
In a terrible shape  
Lord, she got me sufferin'  
With a headache, yeah  
  
Lord, pain in my heart workin'  
Dragging my feet, y'all  
Twelve long days, children  
Had a bite to eat now

Tell me what's wrong with me  
Said I've been sick, y'all, yeah

Will do me no good  
Lord have mercy, children

Somebody, sick, bad shape  
Pain, children, tremblin', y'all  
Legs are tremblin', Lord  
Hands are tied  
Feel like I got a headache  
Right here in my side  
Heart's turning over  
Beating like a drum, y'all

Standing on the outside  
Water in my shoes, children

Troubles out calm, yeah
