I see the shadows as they come to welcome the night  
Treading the time when I know I must turn out the light  
Here in the darkness I lie down to hurt once again  
From letting a mem'ry who's heart sings a song of the wind  
So much like a child yet so very much of a man  
He was a drifter and I wasn't hard of his plan  
He needed me when I met him so I took him in  
Not knowing someday he'd follow a song of the wind  
The wind sings the moving song of fields that'll always green  
The man who has heard its call can't leave a thing unseen  
If I should see him and he needs the warmth of a friend  
I'll try to help him for the short time he was in  
I won't be surprised when I wake and he's gone once again  
For he is a dreamer who follows the song of the wind  
Yes he is a dreamer who's heart sings a song of the wind
