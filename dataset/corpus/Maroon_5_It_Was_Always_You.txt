Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning  
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life, we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize, it was always you  
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you  
  
No more saying who  
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you  
All my hidden desires finally came alive  
No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight  
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life, we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize, it was always you  
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you  
  
Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
  
It was always you  
Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you
