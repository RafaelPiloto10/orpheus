Wake up in the morning and its hard live  
Hard to live yes its hard to live  
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give  
But everyday its getting harder to live  
  
But I would up for being down with the ho  
Still I know I got mic control  
I'm aware of the high and the low  
I've got spiritual mic control  
  
But I move culturally  
Unfortunately, its left up to me  
All real lovers that wanna be ho's  
What we need is just mic control  
  
'Cause its not what you're saying but  
What's in your soul  
Mic control, its called mic control  
Do you have mic control  
You know this style is well original  
  
At the party I got reason to give love in whole  
Mic control, I've got mic control  
I know I'm a reason come not to live  
But every day its getting harder to live  
  
I'm aware of the high and the low  
Mic control, mic control, mic control  
Heart and soul we've got mic control  
  
But I move [for]tually  
Unfortunately, I'm an opponent to me  
Here lies something real  
Mic control we've got mic control  
Do you have mic control
