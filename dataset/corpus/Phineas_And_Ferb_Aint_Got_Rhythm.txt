So you're saying that you don't have rhythm  
But listen at what you're doing right there  
With that stamp and a book you've got a real nice hook  
Sounds to me like you've got rhythm to spare  
  
I have no idea what your talking about  
I've got as much rhythm as that chair  
What happened to me was a tragedy  
But I don't have to be a millionaire  
Look I got a sweet deal going on here  
I've got all the books that I can read  
All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80's  
What more could a librarian need?  
Besides I ain't got rhythm  
No I ain't got rhythm  
Said I ain't got rhythm  
I ain't got rhythm  
  
You're kidding me right, you're, you're kidding me  
Don't you see what you were doing right then  
That's a wicked groove you were starting to move  
Mr., you got rhythm times 10  
  
I think perhaps that your not listening  
I find it tedious to repeat  
It's no big crime  
I just can't keep time  
I'm telling you I lost the beat  
I don't need my face on t-shirts  
Or hit a power-chord guitar  
They were screaming my name  
I guess it's a shame  
But I don't need to be a rock star  
Besides I ain't got rhythm  
No I ain't got rhythm  
Said I ain't got rhythm  
I ain't got rhythm  
  
I ain't got rhythm  
Sounds like rhythm to me  
No I ain't got rhythm  
Seems like they all agree  
Said I ain't got rhythm  
I aint got rhythm  
But your laying down some funky syncopation  
I ain't got rhythm  
But you got that beat  
No I ain't got rhythm  
Look at them, their stomping their feet  
Said I ain't got rhythm  
  
I ain't got rhythm  
It's time for you to rock a brand new generation  
Gonna rock a brand new generation  
  
Cause I ain't got rhythm  
Would you just go join the band  
Hey! Look at me!  
Hey I got rhythm!
