This song is sung for anyone that's listening  
This song is for the broken-spirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow, sad end  
  
It seems everybody wants what someone else has  
There's sorrow enough for all  
Just go in any bar and ask  
With a beer in each hand and a smile in between  
All around's a world grown mean  
  
We've all had our ups and downs  
It's been mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear  
  
Looks like we're all looking for a life worth livin'  
That's why we drink ourselves to sleep  
Yeah, we're all looking for a life worth livin'  
That's why we pray for our souls to keep  
  
There's nothing left now but broken pieces  
Of one man's broken will to care  
And in the end before all is said and done  
How many others might follow him there?  
  
This song is sung for anyone that's listening  
This song is for the broken-spirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow, sad end  
  
Midnight is comin' 'round  
Still mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear
