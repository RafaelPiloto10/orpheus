What does all this beauty mean?  
It captures my attention and I'm speechless  
Sunset, Tennessee, colors burn across the sky  
Slowly fading golden rays  
Greet the moon and kiss the day goodbye  
And I do, I understand  
Is this Your voice, saying "Here I am"?  
  
I am here in the dark  
In the quiet of your heart  
I am here in your corner of the sky  
I'm the light that fades away  
At the turning of this day  
I am here, I am here  
Here, yeah  
  
What does all this music mean?  
The rhythm of a heartbeat and the symphony of every living thing  
Ringing throughout time  
The song of every single soul  
In harmony our voices intertwined  
And when did all begin?  
Was it Your voice, saying "Here I am"?  
  
I am here in the dark  
I'm the music in your heart  
I'm the song in every corner of the sky  
I am here in the light  
In the thunder late at night  
I am here, I am here  
Here, I am here  
  
I am here in the dark  
I'm the song in your heart  
I'm the missing piece that you've had all along  
I am here when you call  
When you rise and when you fall  
I am here, I am here  
I am here, I am here  
Here, here  
I am here  
Here, here
