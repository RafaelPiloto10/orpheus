Yeah,  
Smoking, doping, keep your ears open  
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in  
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at  
And have em even saying how could someone say that  
They're as good as the man who just saw  
Please give me some more  
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping  
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n  
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers  
I'm snatching airplay, from all you AIDS catching singers  
It's a, special delivery on your front step  
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect  
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground  
And have you OD'n saying, y'know, J sound  
Righteous, the brother did what he had to  
I didn't talk about this, so I had you  
Sleeping, breathing saying yo he ain't keeping  
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend  
But here it is, the jam of all jams  
And from this day forth, MC's are getting slammed  
With the  
  
[Chorus]  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah!  
  
I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it  
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it  
Doing a dance in tight bike pants  
So get up on it (hoe!) you'll only get one chance  
To work out, the soreness in your muscles  
Do your own thing, even the hustle  
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known  
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone  
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner  
And look wild like you're tryin to get a part in a  
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip  
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin to flip  
With the  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving, grooving, admit that you've been  
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven  
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant  
All those rumors are small things to a giant  
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother  
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover  
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train  
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, "Wait James!"  
I do damage, use the beef to build a sandwich  
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, "How did you manage  
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?  
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed"  
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing  
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling  
On on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling  
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing  
To the  
  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Know what I'm sayin?  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
It's like a smooth joint, you know what I mean?  
Uhh, aww yeah!  
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Marvelous!
