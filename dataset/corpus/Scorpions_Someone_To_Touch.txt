I'm an alley cat with only seven lives  
I'm the trouble scratching at your door  
When the moon is bright and shining high  
I'm getting loose just like the night before  
One for the money, two for the show  
You can't resist it on a night like this  
I'm the answer baby and you know  
Tonight you're mine, forget the guy you're with  
  
Baby I don't care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
'cause you can take me everywhere  
And you're the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
  
Don't try to tell me that your daddy's mean  
You think your mama wouldn't let me in  
Come on 'n step inside my dream machine  
Don't fight it honey you just can't win  
  
'cause baby I don't care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
'cause you can take me everywhere  
And you're the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
c'mon baby, I think it's you
