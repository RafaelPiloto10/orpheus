Speeding motorcycle  
Won't you change me  
In a world of funny changes  
Speeding motorcycle  
Won't you change me  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Always changing me  
Speeding motorcycle  
Don't you drive wrecklessly  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
  
Many girls have taken you out for a ride,  
Hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets be smart  
Because we don't want a wreck  
We can do a lot of tricks  
We don't have to break our legs  
To get our kicks  
Speeding motorcycle  
The road is ours  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets speed some more  
  
Because we don't need reason  
And we don't need logic  
Because we got feelin'  
And were damn proud of it  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
There's nothing you can do  
Speeding motorcycle  
I love you  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets just go  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets go, lets go, lets go
