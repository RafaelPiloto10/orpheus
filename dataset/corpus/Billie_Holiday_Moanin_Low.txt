Moanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so  
Though he's mean as can be  
He's the kind of man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by  
If I die where'll he be  
He's the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Don't know any reason why  
He treats me so poorly  
What have I gone and done  
Makes me troubles double with his worries  
When surely I ain't deserving of none  
  
Moanin' low  
My sweet man is gonna go  
When he goes, oh Lordy  
He's the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
Moanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so
