Old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin' old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin' old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
