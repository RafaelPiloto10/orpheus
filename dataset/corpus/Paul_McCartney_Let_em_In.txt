Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Do me a favor,  
Open the door and let 'em in  
Sister Suzie, brother John,  
Martin Luther, Phil And Don,  
Brother Michael, Auntie Gin,  
Open the door and let 'em in.  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Do me a favor,  
Open the door and let 'em in.
