The sun brings up another day  
Near the little fishin' town  
The nets are hung out in the wind  
The sails are down  
A seagull flies above my head  
Spinning slowly towards the sea  
He seems so free, and just like me  
He rides the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a travelin' man  
Nothin' left behind me but the road  
I'm a travelin' man  
Won't you share the load  
  
Lonesome shepherd in the field ahead  
Moonlight flows across the grass  
The rocky hills catch the light above  
Their shadows cast  
Lonely by the day  
Drifting late at night  
The wind is creepin' through my ragged coat  
What a life  
  
[Chorus]
