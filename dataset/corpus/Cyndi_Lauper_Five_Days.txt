The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
Five days  
I ran a wolf across highways  
In the early spring (don't stop you're gonna break my heart)  
The rest of my days  
Should I stay should I pray  
That I'm here now clear now  
Live with the fears  
To extend my tears  
Shed no have no  
Undecided  
Five days in which I can't wait now (I need you)  
Can't wait now (you needed me)  
Bet you can't wait now (whatever happened to compatible two)  
Making you wait now  
  
I ran a wolf across highways in the early spring  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
  
Have I the meanings  
I don't think I'm cheating  
I create like the windy city (Don't go)  
But the drums spread (I told you so)  
Here we go with the games now  
Maintain now  
Might as well have you down now  
Five days that you can't wait now (no need to smile)  
Making you hate now  
  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
  
Bet you can't wait now  
Making you wait now  
Don't go I told you so  
After what you've had  
That look on your face you rat  
When you talk like that  
I just want to get you back
