Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rollin' past the rink  
Past the record shack  
Pink fins in the falling rain  
Rollin'  
To the blue lights past the water mains  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Weekends we'd get  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
Ray's dad teaches math  
Zero  
I'm a dunce  
I'm a decimal in his class  
Last night's kisses won't erase  
Zero  
I just can't keep the numbers in their place  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Last night we had  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
When it comes to mathematics  
I got static in the attic  
"No sir, nothin's clear!"  
I'll be blackboard blind on Monday  
Dreamin' of blue runways  
On the edge of here  
A little atmosphere  
  
Blue lights out on airport road  
Motown, in a field in a farmer's grove  
Big planes comin' overhead  
Lowdown  
You can see the bolts  
You can see the tire treads  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Weekends we'd get  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Oh, little darlin'  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
