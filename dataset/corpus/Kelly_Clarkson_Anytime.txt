Anytime you feel  
Like you just can't hold on  
Just hold on to my love  
I'll help you be strong  
  
But you're so afraid to lose  
And baby I can't reach your heart  
I can't face this world it's keeping us apart  
And I could be the one to show you  
Everything you missed before  
Just hold on now  
'Cause I could be the one to give you more  
  
[Chorus]  
Anytime you need a love baby I'm on your side  
Just let me be the one that can make it all right  
Anytime you need a love baby you're in my heart  
I could make it all right  
  
I look into your eyes  
And I feel it coming through  
I can't help but want you more than I want to  
So baby take our love your way  
Cast them all on me  
That's all I ever wanted was just to make you see  
  
But I could be the one to heal you  
All that you've been searching for  
Just hold on to my love  
And baby let me give you more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now there's no way out  
And I can't help the way I feel  
'Cause baby I'm on fire  
And I'll be waiting right here  
You know our love isn't real  
  
[Chorus]
