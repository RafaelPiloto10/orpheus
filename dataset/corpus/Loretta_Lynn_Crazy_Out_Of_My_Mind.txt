I'm through the place where I don't know my name  
It's a world for the lonely go insane  
I've brought along the little pieces of me he left behind  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
I've got no place to go but crazy out of my mind over baby  
He's the last thing I remember that I won't forget in time  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
  
I've watched him leave with hurt clear out of sight  
And from that day on my mind just don't work right  
What a little sence left in me I'll leave here in this wine  
Got no place to go but crazy out of my mind  
I've got no place to go...
