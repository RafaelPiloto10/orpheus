Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
You're ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Baby oh sweet baby  
I didn't mean a word that I said  
(Well now) you know that I love you  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
I never meant to hurt you  
Must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
(talk talk talk it over)  
  
Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
You're ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Come on a little closer  
Can't we just forgive and forget  
Everything seems to work out  
I never meant to hurt you  
I must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
  
Don't let it no don't let it slip away  
Oh no baby ooh
