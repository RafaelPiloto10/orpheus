When I was a young man - no bigger than this  
A chocolate egg cream was not to be missed  
Some U Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk  
Stir it up into a heady fro - tasted just like silk  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal St.  
And I think there's Ken's in Boston  
There must be something in L.A.  
But Becky's on Kings Highway  
Was the Egg Cream of choice  
And if you don't believe me  
Go ask any of the boys  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
The only good thing I remember about P.S.92  
Was the Egg Cream served at Becky's  
It was a fearsome brew  
For fifty cents you got a shot - chocolate bubbles up your nose  
That made it easier to deal with knife flights  
and kids pissing in the street  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
So the next time you're in Brooklyn - Please say hello for me  
At Totonno's for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's  
But mostly you go to Becky's - sit in a booth and say hello  
And have two chocolate Egg Cream - one to stay and go  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream
