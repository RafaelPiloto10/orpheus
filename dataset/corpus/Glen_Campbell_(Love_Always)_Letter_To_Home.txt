You might think ther'e some big reason  
Why I took this time to write  
The cards and letters there's been to few of those  
But I just stopped to realize  
How long that I've been gone  
But there's a few small things I need to know.  
  
Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night?  
Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light?  
And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road?  
I miss you so.  
  
Well years keep slipping by me  
Like miles out on the road  
But I don't guess I'll change my way of life  
There's no harm in holding memories  
But please tell me if you can  
If I can bring those old times inside.  
  
Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars?  
Do the roads still go for hours without cars?  
Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door?  
Just like before  
Tell me more.  
  
Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon?  
Can you still reach out and touch the moon?  
Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days?  
  
Love always
