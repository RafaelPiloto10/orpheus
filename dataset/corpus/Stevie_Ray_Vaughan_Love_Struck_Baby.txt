Well I'm love struck baby I must confess  
Life without you darlin' is a solid mess  
Thinkin' 'bout you baby give me such a thrill  
I gotta have you baby can't get my fill  
I love ya baby an' I know just what to do  
  
I still remember and let it be said  
The way you make me feel it take a fool to forget  
I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head  
And what you do little baby I ain't over yet  
  
Every time I see ya make me feel so fine  
My heart beatin' crazy my blood runnin' wild  
Your lovin' makes me feel like a mighty mighty man  
Love me baby ain't I your man  
  
I'm a love struck baby  
Yeah I'm a love struck baby  
You got me love struck baby  
And I know just what to do  
  
Sparks start flyin' every time we meet  
Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet  
Your kisses trip me up and they're just doggone sweet  
Don't you know baby you can't be beat  
  
I'm a love struck baby  
Yeah I'm a love struck baby  
You got me love struck baby  
And I know just what to do
