If I could say the things I feel, it wouldn't be the same  
Some things are not spoken of, some things have no name  
Though the words come hard to me, I'll say them just for you  
For this is something rare for me this feeling is so new  
You see I love the way you love me  
I love the way you smile at me  
I love the way we live this life we're in  
Long ago I heard the song that lovers sing to me  
And through the days with each new phrase I hummed that melody  
And all along I loved the song but I never learned it through  
But since the day you came along, I've saved it just for you  
I don't believe in magic but I do believe in you  
And when you say you believe in me  
There's so much magic I can do  
Now you see me now you don't watch me dive below  
Deep down in your love lake where the sweet fish come and go  
And I might sink and I might drown but death don't mean a thing  
'Cause life continues right or wrong when I play this birthday song  
I learned from you, and you can't even sing
