Honey is for bees, silly bear.  
Besides, there's jelly beans everywhere.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.  
  
It doesn't matter  
How you feel.  
Life is just a ferris wheel.  
It's always up and down,  
Don't make a sound.  
  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
  
It's just the sweet weather  
And the peacock feathers.  
In the morning,  
It will all be better.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.  
  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
  
Honey is for bees, silly bear.  
Besides, there's jelly beans everywhere.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.
