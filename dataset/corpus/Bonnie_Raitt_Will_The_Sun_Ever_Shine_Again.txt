Rain is pourin' down like the  
Heavens are hurtin'.  
Seems like it's been dark since  
The devil knows when.  
How do you go on, never knowin'  
For certain,  
Will the sun ever shine again?  
  
Fells like it's been years since  
It started to thunder.  
Clouds are campin' out in the valley  
And glen.  
How do you go on, when you can't help  
But wonder.  
Will the sun ever shine again?  
  
What if the rain keeps fallin'?  
What if the sky stays gray?  
What if the wind keeps squallin',  
And never go away?  
  
Maybe the soon the storm will be  
Tired of blowin'.  
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen.  
How do you go on, if there's no way  
Of knowin'?  
Will the sun ever shine?  
Wish I could say.  
Send me a sign-  
One little ray.  
Lord, if you're listenin', how long  
Until then?  
Will the sun ever shine again?
