I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone, somewhere,  
I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone, somewhere.  
Words lost in the past  
Of memories that will never last.  
  
My mind wanders the crowds in a search,  
In the search of the one that I feel is my life,  
It the crowds.  
  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.
