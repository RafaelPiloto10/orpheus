Got out really early from the factory, driving like a nut in the rain  
Don't think I was acting so hysterically  
But I didn't see a thing until it came  
Man, the drunks were verbal in the takeaway  
Beating up the Chinese at the counter  
I put a few inside me at the end of the day  
I took out my revenge on the revolution counter  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
You'd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand, new car  
In walks Bud, with his exploding nose  
He'd been giving it maximum today  
He shouted, how the devil you in trouble, I suppose  
But all you ever do is run away  
Turned up the motor into hyper-drive  
I wasn't gonna take any of that  
Don't get bright ideas about a suicide  
'Cause all I ever hear is zoom, wam, bam past me  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
You'd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand, new car  
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Bits of me are scattered in the trees and in the hedges  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand, new car  
Nothing seem to happen that ain't happened before  
I see it all through flashes of depression  
I dry up my drink and people running for the door  
God, I make some kind of impression  
'Cause when I'm disconnected from the driving wheel  
I'm only half the man I should be  
But metal hitting metal, isn't all I feel  
And everything is good as it possibly could be  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
You'd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand, new car  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Bits of me are scattered in the trees and in the hedges  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Into a brand, new car  
Crawling from the wreckage, crawling from the wreckage  
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage
