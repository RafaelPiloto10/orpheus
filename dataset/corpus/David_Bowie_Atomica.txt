I'm just a rock star stabbing away  
I take the - I take the leave for another day  
I'm [?]  
Just let me know if I sing too much  
When you're head over heals and the magic is there but impossible  
  
Possible  
Impossible  
And when the police take me away  
Possible  
Impossible  
It wasn't you it was mothers' day  
  
Let's get this show on the road  
Let's get Atomica  
Let's rock till we explode  
Let's get Atomica  
  
They protect you from the voices  
Protect from the visions  
Protect you from the silence for another day  
These rotten people sure know how to live  
When you're head over heels and the magic is gone it's impossible,  
impossible  
  
Impossible  
Impossible  
That we should swim in a covered up pool  
Impossible  
Impossible  
By the white trees dressed in double true  
  
Let's get this show on the road  
Let's get Atomica  
Let's rock till we explode  
Let's get Atomica  
  
I hold myself like a god  
Like a god  
[4xs] -Like  
  
I'm just a pop star jumping away  
I leave the - I leave the sins for another day  
A little puny, and just let me know, if I talk too much  
When you're head over heels and the magic is there but impossible  
  
Impossible  
Impossible  
That we should swim in a covered up pool  
Impossible  
Impossible  
By the white trees dressed in double true  
  
Let's get this show on the road  
Let's get Atomica  
Let's rock till we explode  
Let's get Atomica  
[2xs]
