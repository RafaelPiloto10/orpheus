You've been picked and it's over  
What's the chip on your shoulder?  
Out side were solid rainbows  
Inside is where the heart grows  
Picking up the pieces  
Something more to believe in  
  
As you search the embers  
Think what you've had, remember  
Hang on, don't you let go now  
You know, with every heartbeat, we love  
Nothing comes easy  
Hang on, ask the lonely  
  
You've got some fascination  
With your high expectations  
This love is your obsession  
Your heart, your past possession  
Let down your defenses  
Won't be up to the one who cares  
  
As you search the embers  
Think what you've had, remember  
Hang on, don't you let go now  
You know, with every heartbeat, we love  
Nothing comes easy  
  
Hang on, ask the lonely  
When you're feeling love's unfair  
You just ask the lonely  
When you're lost in deep despair  
You just ask the lonely  
  
Ask the lonely  
When you're down in deep despair  
When you're down in deep despair  
Ask the lonely  
Lonely
