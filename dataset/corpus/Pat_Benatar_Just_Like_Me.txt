It's Just Like Me, to say to you  
Love me dear, an' I'll be true  
And all I want for you to say  
Is you'll come home with me each day  
You could be my love  
That's what I want  
Just you, secure and safe from harm  
It's Just Like Me, to feel so good  
And fall so much, in love with you  
  
It's Just Like Me, It's Just Like Me  
I'm not your fool, that's what I'll be  
It's just like you, to say goodbye  
And leave me all alone to cry  
  
It's Just Like Me, to say to you  
Love me dear, an' I'll be true  
And all I want for you to say  
Is you'll come home with me each day  
  
It's Just Like Me, It's Just Like Me  
I'm not your fool, that's what I'll be  
It's just like you, to say goodbye  
And leave me all alone I cry  
  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like You  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like You  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like You  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like You  
  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me  
It's Just Like Me
