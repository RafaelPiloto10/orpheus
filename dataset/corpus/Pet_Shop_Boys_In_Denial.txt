In denial, no  
My life's a trial  
I'm not denying  
That every little bit hurts  
It's a problem  
That I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while, getting away  
Before it gets any worse today  
  
You're in denial  
And that is final  
You're not admitting  
You should be quitting  
All these  
Queens and fairies  
And muscle Marys  
The rough trade boyfriend  
Who in his pathetic own way  
Denies he's gay  
Why can't you see?  
This is a fantasy world  
  
Think I'm going mad  
How do you know if you're  
Going mad?  
  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Look at me I'm sad  
  
I'm not denying  
I could be trying  
A little harder  
To deal with some of this stuff  
  
Know what I'm thinking?  
Less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes and you'd feel  
A little less rough  
  
Is that enough?  
My life is absurd, I'm living it  
Upside down  
Like a vampire, working at  
Night, sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows  
He's gay  
  
Can you love me anyway?
