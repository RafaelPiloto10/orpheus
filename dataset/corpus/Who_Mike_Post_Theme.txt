We're not strong enough!  
We're not young enough!  
We're not long enough,  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally we're not even old enough!  
  
Late at night, we're in a video-game dream,  
There is no lover in this numbered scene  
We summon every childhood ghost we've seen,  
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post Theme,  
  
(Chorus)  
Everything is alright (ba-do-ba)  
We pray today (ba-ba-ba-do-ba)  
Everything is OK (ba-do-ba)  
We play today  
  
Late at night, on the underground train,  
Through endless suburbs in endless pain,  
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain,  
Suddenly we hear Mike Post Again,  
  
(Chorus)  
  
We watch those films,  
That make men cry,  
Young lovers kiss,  
Then fight, and die,  
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,  
We have to face the truth sometime.  
  
We're not strong enough!  
We're not young enough!  
We're not long enough,  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally we're not even old enough!  
  
Well late at night we found our racing team,  
We're faced with women and reality games,  
We feel alive,  
We feel new and blind,  
We're hearing Mike Post in the air this time  
  
(Chorus)  
  
We watch those films,  
That make men cry,  
Young lovers kiss,  
Then fight, and die,  
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,  
We have to face the truth sometime
