Summer sands have lost their charm  
Let 'em go  
Autumn winds will do no harm  
Let 'em blow  
Save up all your dreams  
Oh, save them, save them  
Live beyond your means  
But keep your dreams  
Won't you?  
  
You go from A to B to C  
On demand  
Like algebra or geometry  
Diagrammed  
Your resolution's weak  
But we're not all damned  
The future's not so bleak  
In this wasteland  
When  
  
Always, always  
Summer comes  
Always  
  
You're too over-sensitive  
That's the charge  
Any criticism starts  
To loom too large  
Caution to the winds  
Throw it, throw it  
Don't cash in your dreams  
Or you will blow it  
  
Your resolution's weak  
But we're not all damned  
The future's not so bleak  
In this wasteland  
When  
  
Always, always  
Summer comes  
Always
