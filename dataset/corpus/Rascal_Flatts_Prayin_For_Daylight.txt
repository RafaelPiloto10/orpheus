I don't want to spend another lonely night... Ooooh  
I've got the lights turned up, the door is locked  
The bedroom tv's on  
Doin' the only thing that gets me through  
The night since you've been gone  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
Waitin' for that mornin' sun  
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear I'll make it right  
Don't make me spend another lonely night  
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)  
  
I made a bad miscalculation, bettin'  
You would never leave (Ooooh)  
'Cause if you're gettin' on with your new life  
Then where does that leave me?  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
Waitin' for that mornin' sun  
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear I'll make it right  
Don't make me spend another lonely night (spend... another lonely night)  
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)  
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
Hopin' that I didn't wait too long (I didn't wait too long)  
But this is just the dark before the dawn......Oh  
  
Deep in my heart I know that you love me  
As much as I love you (You know I love you girl)  
And that you must be lyin' somewhere  
Lookin' up to heaven too  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
Waitin' for that mornin' sun  
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear I'll make it right  
Don't make me spend another lonely night  
(Make me spend another lonely night)  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
Waitin' for that mornin' sun  
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear I'll make it right  
Don't make me spend another lonely night (another lonely night)  
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)  
  
Prayin' for daylight  
  
(I don't want to spend another lonely night)  
(I don't want to spend another lonely night)  
Prayin' for daylight  
(I don't want to spend another lonely night) Ooooh  
Prayin' for daylight
