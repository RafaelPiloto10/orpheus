Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day  
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame  
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed  
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised  
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame  
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame  
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
And only God can lead the people back into the faith again  
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord
