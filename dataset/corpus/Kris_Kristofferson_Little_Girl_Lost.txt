See the little girl lost: walking through this world alone  
She ain't looking for a lover, she's just looking for a home  
If you want more than sympathy then look for something else  
Cause she's not true to anyone, not even to herself  
  
She'll have sixteen smiling strangers who are handing her a line  
While she's drawing dirty pictures on the black side of your mind  
And that body she'll let anybody hold, but the devil's got her soul  
But if you take her, take her easy  
  
Treat her gentle, she used to love me  
See the little girl lost, pleading silently for help  
Knowing no one understands her, she don't understand herself  
She'll feed your hungry ego til you think you're quite a man  
But you better count your fingers when she turns loose of your hand  
  
Cause you're just a game she's playing any way that she can win  
And you ain't about to touch her any deeper than her skin  
In that body anybody can control, but the devil's got her soul  
But if you take her, take her easy  
Treat her gentle, she used to love me
