Swing my cutlass at the tall grass  
And anything that gets in my way  
That's my job here, let's be quite clear  
Working is how I spend my day  
Scary? Verrry I can instill some fear  
Owners don't know this is my show  
I've seen them all disappear  
  
Chorus  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat paperman  
I'm the only boss around  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat white man  
I'm de only boss in town  
  
Creole  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
  
Chorus  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat paperman  
He be an annoying little gnat  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat white man  
This is hippolyte's habitat  
  
Creole  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
  
Now you've met me, don't forget me  
Hippolyte the french handyman  
But my work waits, please the ingrates  
They're all a part of my plan  
  
Chorus  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat paperman  
He be an annoying little gnat  
Who's the boss man?  
Surely ain't dat white man  
This is hippolyte's habitat  
  
Creole  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
Qui moun' qui, patron la c' pa blanc la ce moin'  
  
There's a place in france where they do the cutlass dance
