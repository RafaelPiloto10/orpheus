In the twilight glow I see her  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
As we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
  
Love is like a dying ember  
Where only memories remain  
Through the ages I'll remember  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Now my hair has turned to silver  
All my life I've loved in vain  
I can see her star in heaven  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes crying in the rain
