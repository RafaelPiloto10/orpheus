I've been running from the truth  
I've been running since my youth, tired of running  
I will stand here till you see  
I am you and you are me, tired of running  
There really is no difference when you look beneath the skin  
Someday I know we'll go beyond this world we're living in  
  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Dancing in my dreams  
  
There's no hiding in the dark  
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder  
Just as long as we believe  
The truth will set us free, it's getting louder  
All that really matters is the light in your face  
In you I see the longing of the whole human race  
  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Dancing in my dreams  
  
On and on the story goes  
Or it's the passing of the torch  
With one small voice it all begins  
Then there are millions more, millions more
