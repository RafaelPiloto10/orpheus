Pass It Around  
  
I wish I had a place to stay in L.A. for a week or so.  
I feel like bein' jive, hangin' out, maybe go to Mexico.  
'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way I want to' be.  
Just want to' sit in a tree, sail out to sea, live like some fantasy, ahh
baby.  
  
'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.  
Tired of goin' to get laid at the lost and found.  
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,  
In view of all that's been goin' down,  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
  
I wonder why I'm doin', what I've been doin' for a while.  
Can't say it's the money, no, so maybe it's the style.  
'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way that I like it.  
Just want to' get on a plane, go some place insane, throw myself one real good
fit.  
  
'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.  
Tired of goin' to get laid at the lost and found.  
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,  
In view of all that's been goin' down,  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
Listen to me baby.  
Pass it around.  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
I want to pass it around.  
I want to get on out and pass it around.  
I want to pass it around.  
  
'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.  
I want to pass it around.  
Tired of goin' to get laid at the lost and found.  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,  
I want to pass it around.  
In view of all that's been goin' down,  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.
