Here come ol' flat top  
He come grooving up slowly,  
He got Joo Joo eye-ball,  
He one holy roller,  
He got hair down to his knee.  
Got to be a joker,  
He just do what he please.  
  
He wear no shoeshine,  
He got toe jam football,  
He got monkey finger,  
He shoot Coca-Cola,  
He say I know you, you know me,  
One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
He bag production,  
He got walrus gumboot,  
He got O-no side board,  
He one spinal cracker,  
He got feet down below his knee.  
Hold you in his armchair,  
You can feel his disease.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
He roller coaster,  
He got early warning,  
He got Muddy Water,  
He one Mojo filter,  
He say one and one and one is three.  
Got to be good looking,  
'Cause he so hard to see.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together
