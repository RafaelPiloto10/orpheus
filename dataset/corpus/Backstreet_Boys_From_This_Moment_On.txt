From this moment life has begun  
From this moment you are the one  
Right beside you is where I belong  
From this moment on  
  
From this moment I have been blessed  
I live only for your happiness  
And for your love I'd give my last breath  
From this moment on  
  
I give my hand to you with all my heart  
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start  
You and I will never be apart  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
Chorus  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment on, oh  
  
You're the reason I believe in love  
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above  
All we need is just the two of us  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
Chorus - Repeat  
  
I will love you (I will love you)  
As long as I live  
From this moment on
