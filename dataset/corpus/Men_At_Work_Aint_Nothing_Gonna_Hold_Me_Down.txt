Last night I had the strangest dream,  
I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find you  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?  
  
And you said  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
  
You're on the road and now you pray you'll last  
The road behind you was rocky  
But now you're feeling cocky  
You look at me and you'll see your past  
Is that the reason you're running so fast?  
  
And she said  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
  
Never let another girl like you, whip me over  
Never let another girl like you, drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you, I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you, have to say  
  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving  
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no, I've got to keep on moving
