Round and round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
You see me standing there  
And act like you don't know me  
But last night you were calling me  
Saying you want me  
  
Oh, why you always make me feel  
Like I'm the one, that's crazy  
You got my heart racin'  
My, my heart racin'  
  
Boy, I need you here with me  
We can't go on this way  
I'm fallen hard for you  
All I can say  
  
We're goin' round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round and round  
  
You try to pull me close  
And whisper in my ear  
You always told me lies  
I've cried out all my tears  
I push my feelings to the side  
But then you bring 'em back  
B-Bring 'em back  
Now you got me singing  
  
Boy, I need you here with me  
We can't go on this way  
I'm falling hard for you  
All I can say  
  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round  
  
Love me or love me not  
I'm starin' at the clock  
I take them flower petals off  
And then I watch them drop (x2)  
  
Boy  
I need you here with me  
I can't go on this way  
I'm falling hard for you  
All I can sayeeaay  
  
Round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round and round  
  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin' round and round  
  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round  
  
Ooo oh Ooo oh Ooo oh (x3)
