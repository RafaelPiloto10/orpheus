You must be lost in a faraway land  
I searched forever your footprints in the sand  
I feel you need me, I have to answer  
That desperate call that I do not understand  
  
A burning bridge, a lonely highway  
Another dark night thinking alone  
What could've happened, am I just dreaming  
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
So on and on I keep on running  
To make the border before the light  
Just one more river, then I can make it  
Again you'll be in my arms tonight  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border ...
