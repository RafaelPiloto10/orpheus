So impressed with all you do  
Tried so hard to be like you  
Flew too high and burnt the wing  
Lost my faith in everything  
  
Lick around divine debris  
Taste the wealth of hate in me  
Shedding skin succumb defeat  
This machine is obsolete  
  
Made the choice to go away  
Drink the fountain of decay  
Tear a hole exquisite red  
Fuck the rest and stab it dead  
  
Broken bruised forgotten sore  
Too fucked up to care anymore  
Poisoned to my rotten core  
Too fucked up to care anymore  
  
In the back off the side far away is a place where I hide where I  
Stay tried to say tried to ask I needed to all alone by myself where  
Were you?  
How could I ever think it's funny how everything that  
Swore it wouldn't change is different now just like you  
Would always say we'll make it through then my head fell apart  
And where were you?  
How could I ever think it's funny how everything you swore would  
Never change is different now like you said you and me make it  
Through didn't quite fell apart  
Where the fuck were you?
