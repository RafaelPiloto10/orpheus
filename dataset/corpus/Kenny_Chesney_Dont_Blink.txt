I turned on the evening news  
Saw a old man being interviewed  
Turning a hundred and two today  
Asked him what's the secret to life  
He looked up from his old pipe  
Laughed and said "All I can say is"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't blink  
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you  
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your
wife  
Don't blink  
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did  
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your "better half"  
Of fifty years is there in bed  
And you're praying God takes you instead  
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think  
So don't blink  
  
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said  
"Best start putting first things first"  
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand  
You can't flip it over and start again  
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I've been tryin' to slow it down  
I've been tryin' to take it in  
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Naw, don't blink  
Life goes faster than you think
