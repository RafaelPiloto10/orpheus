  
  
Long time, some time ago  
You broke my heart  
And you broke my soul  
You keep on going on and on  
And I was hoping,  
That you'll come back  
  
Won't you come back to me  
Come back to me my love  
Come back to me, come back to me my love  
Won't you come back to me  
Come back to me, come back to me my love  
  
You kept on hoping  
For the day to come  
When you and I  
Would be like one  
It never happened  
Why should I lie  
Always hoping that you'll come back  
  
Won't you come back ...  
  
And he will come  
And fill my heart  
With the love  
That I want  
  
Long time ...
