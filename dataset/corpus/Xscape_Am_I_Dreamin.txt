Am I dreaming, baby,  
Are you for real?  
  
Verse One:  
(Ol' Skool):  
Things are kind of hazy,  
And my head's all cloudy inside.  
Now I've heard talk of angels, baby,  
But never thought I would have one to call mine.  
  
(Tiny):  
See you are just too good to be true,  
And I hope, there's not some kind of mirage,  
With you, oh baby.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I dreamin',  
Am I just imagining you're here in my life?  
Am I dreamin',  
Pinch me to see if it's real,  
Cause my mind can't decide.  
  
Verse Two:  
(Ol' Skool): Will this last for one night,  
(Kandi): Or do I have you for a lifetime?  
(Ol' Skool): Please say that it's forever,  
And that it's not an illusion to my eye.  
  
(LaTocha):  
And I hope that you just don't up and disappear,  
My love, I pray,  
That it's not a hoax, and it's for real, oh.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
(Ol' Skool): Baby I know,  
Sometime, say that sometime,  
I need you to show me girl.  
Show me that you're not a mirage,  
(LaTocha): Oh baby, I need you, I need you, I need you.  
Oh, I need you to pinch me, baby.  
(Ol' Skool): I need you to pinch me baby,  
Am I dreamin baby?  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Break:  
(Ol' Skool): My mind can't decide, no no,  
(LaTocha): Oh, baby,  
Touch me baby, feel me baby.  
(Ol' Skool): I want to know if you'll be right there,  
(LaTocha): Oh oh oh...  
(Ol' Skool): I want to know if you'll be right there,  
Tell me this is not an illusion.  
(LaTocha): Touch me baby, I want you to feel me baby,  
(Ol' Skool): Somebody let me know,  
I want to know if you'll be right there,  
If it's real,  
This is not a mirage, no.
