Going home in a trailer filled with canada dry,  
Looking forward to being with you.  
Got in to the broadway and what do I find ?  
Some lady's been sleeping there, too.  
I was dreamin' of our meetin' all down the m1  
'cause I hadn't seen you for so long.  
Then out of the blue, something came down and warned me  
And I sat there and wrote down this song.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day all my dreams turned to ashes  
And I lost my blues and I smiled.  
Well, I walked in the door and I heard you two laughing,  
Just like I'd hoped that we'd do.  
So I went up the stairs, left your keys on the table,  
And I wrote on the mirror, 'we're through!'.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day that I had, honey.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
And I've got the blues out just bad.  
Going home on a train, going back to my mother,  
Feeling better already, keep telling myself:  
'don't you cry, you'll forget him and find a new lover,  
So let's sit back and drink to his health.'  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day that I felt my heart breaking,  
Ain't it funny, after all I've survived.  
Ain't it funny, after all I've survived.
