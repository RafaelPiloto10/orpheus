This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be  
See you later  
Tomorrow's calling  
I've gotta run  
It's so exciting  
A little scary  
I wish you could come  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
::Chorus::  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be real...fun  
The clock is tickin'  
Telephone ringin'  
How time does fly  
Don't look so sad  
Don't look so lonely  
Oh, this ain't goodbye  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
::Chorus::  
I've got a full tank of gasoline  
I think it's enough to follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be real...fun  
This is gonna be real...fun  
This is gonna be real
