I used to wanna live inside a fairytale  
I wanted to be perfect and complete  
But every time I tried to figure out my life  
I was always disappointed with the ending  
And everything's different now  
I am not the same anymore  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
Every day I find another reason why  
I'm grateful for the miracle you sent  
And even when it's hard I gotta thank you Lord  
For giving me the blessing of a breath  
The one thing I know that is true  
It's not about me anymore  
It's all about You  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
Fairytales come and go  
But everybody knows  
There's more to be told  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
From the inside out  
From the inside out
