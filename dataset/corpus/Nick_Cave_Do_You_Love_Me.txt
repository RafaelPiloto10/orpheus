I found her on a night of fire and noise  
Wild bells rang in a wild sky  
I knew from that moment on  
I'll love her till the day that I died  
And I kissed away a thousand tears  
My lady of the various sorrows  
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen  
Some kept safe for tomorrow  
On and endless night, silver star spangled  
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me? do you love me?  
Do you love me? do you love me?  
Do you love me? do you love me?  
Do you love me? like I love you?  
  
She was given to me to put things right  
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her  
Still I seemed so obsolete and small  
I found god and all his devils inside her  
In my bed she cast the blizzard out  
A mock sun blazed upon her head  
So completely filled with light she was  
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad  
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled  
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She had a heart full of love and devotion  
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror  
Well, I try, I do, I really try  
But I just err, baby, I do, I error  
So come find me, my darling one  
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs  
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun  
Blood running down the inside of her legs  
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled  
Band the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All things move toward their end  
I knew before I met her that I would lose her  
I swear I made every effort to be good to her  
I made every effort not to abuse her  
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles  
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle  
  
[Chorus]
