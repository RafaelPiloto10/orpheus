Hey, yeah, yeah  
Day and night, you've always on my mind  
A love like ours was very hard to find  
But now your love has been taken away  
What can I do to make you stay  
Days go by, but still so much more tears to cry  
So far apart, left me with this lonely broken heart  
  
Chorus:  
Baby I can't stop thinking about love tonight  
Can't even tell you what's wrong or right  
I need you here to love me for the rest of my life  
Don't you know how much loving I have for you  
When you're not around my heart breaks in two  
Baby, I can't stop thinking about love tonight  
Can't stop thinking 'bout you?.  
  
To love is what I do best  
You'll always be better than the rest  
It won't be easy finding someone new  
'Coz there's no other one like you  
The night goes on, and I still think of you from dusk 'till dawn  
I love you so, don't know how I'm ever gonna let you  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Baby I hope you know I love you  
With all my heart and soul  
If you open your eyes, look into my heart  
You'll see the love in store for you  
  
(Instrumental)  
(Repeat Chorus 'till it fades)
