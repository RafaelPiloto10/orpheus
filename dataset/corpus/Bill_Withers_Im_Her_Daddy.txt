How do you do, Lucy?  
You sure been hard to find  
I heard you had a daughter six years old  
And I just can keep from crying  
  
Six years and Lucy  
Lord, have mercy  
That's a long time  
That's a long time  
  
Is she pretty? Has she grown?  
Does she sleep well in a room of her own?  
Can I see her? Does she know  
That I'm her daddy? I'm her daddy  
  
Did you give her love, love, one of my pictures?  
Does she carry, yeah, yeah, picture with her?  
Does she show it to the baby sitter  
And say, see that man, that's my daddy  
That's my daddy, yeah  
  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
Poor Lucy, poor Lucy, poor Lucy, oh Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy
