I'd like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that you'll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
I'd like to play you something low and sexy  
Look at our dancers they're so young and pretty? Hi Olga!  
And when we start to groove you can hear the  
Saxophones blow  
  
Ah show business it's just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby, blow  
  
I'd like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that you'll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
I want to bring a tear to your eye  
Awww good old Poe don't he make you cry  
Ain't it great the way he writes about the  
Mysteries of life  
  
Ah show business is just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby, blow  
Go goose, go.
