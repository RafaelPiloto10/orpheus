[Verse 1]  
I am the promise that you cannot keep  
Reap what you sow  
Find what you seek  
I am the sorceress down in the deep  
I am the earth under your feet  
I am the moon with no light of my own  
You are the sun, guarding the throne  
I heard the angels whisper to me  
"Look for the signs, he is the one."  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll be the bride that is married to life  
You are the day, I am the night  
We knew a blanket of silver and gold  
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told  
I need your strength it will keep me from harm  
I'll be your Queen, safe in your arms  
Don't want to get to the end of my days  
Saying I wasn't amazed  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too
