You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face  
And you try to see, girl  
The way things were when we were at your place  
In the days it was just you and me, girl  
And you cry because things ain't like before  
Well don't you know they can't be that way anymore  
But don't worry baby  
  
I can't talk now, I'm not alone  
So put your ear close to the phone  
'Cause this is the last dance  
This is the last chance for hearts of stone  
  
If there was something, baby, that I could do  
Something that would last, honey, I would  
But we all know, girl, especially you do  
How you can't return to your past, no  
So girl close your eyes and I'll be there  
Hold me once more and we can go anywhere  
Ah, we could  
  
I can't talk now, I'm not alone  
So put your ear close to the phone  
'Cause this is the last dance  
This is the last chance for hearts of stone  
  
And you cry because things ain't like before  
Well don't you know they can't be like that anymore  
Well I know it, baby
