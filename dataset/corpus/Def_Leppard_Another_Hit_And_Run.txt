Union Jack is back with a hole in his head  
He's gettin' badly burned every time  
He's laughin' at me and dancin' on my sneakers  
And his sixties songs are blowin' up my speakers  
  
I say you got no respect  
Respect for authority  
You're just playing your dirty tricks  
And then come cryin' to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hit and run, hit and run  
It's just a hit and run  
Another hit and run  
  
The bulldog lost his bite and his breath has gone bad  
And the whole damn world is really laughin' mad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hit it!!  
Oh bring it down  
Oh you bring it down  
  
I say you ain't got no respect  
I say you ain't got no respect  
No you ain't got no respect  
And you hit me when I'm down  
  
Hit and run, hit and run  
It's just another hit and run  
I said it's just another hit and run  
  
Oh yeah, hit and run  
Oh yeah, hit and run  
Oh yeah, hit and run  
Oh yeah, hit and run  
Oh yeah, hit and run  
It's just another hit and run  
Hit and run
