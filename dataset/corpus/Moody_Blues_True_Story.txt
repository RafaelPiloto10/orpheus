Now listen to me people  
'Cause I want to tell you something  
Every single day  
I go on my way  
And I won't worry about my baby  
Worry about my girl  
'Cause she's a pretty one  
Yeah, yeah  
Whoa, yeah  
  
Find me another woman  
My love for her is gone  
And I don't worry about my baby  
Worry about my girl  
Oh yeah  
Just have to tell me true  
Oh yeah  
  
If she had to do the thing she done  
She might have used more tact  
I can't be responsible  
For all the love she lacked  
  
Yeah, yeah  
This is a true story, people  
  
That's a pretty tune  
I'm a telling you  
  
'Cause every single day  
When I go on my way  
I won't worry about my baby  
Yeah, she's in another town  
I'll tell you, baby  
Whoa, yeah
