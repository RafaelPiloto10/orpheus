You belong to me  
From the moment I saw your face  
This is the one I can't replace  
I belong to you  
And every day is the perfect day  
And even more when I hear you say  
You belong to me  
Forever and always, just like the sky  
You belong to me  
I don't care what they say and I don't know why  
You belong to me  
Forever and always, you are the one  
And you belong to me  
  
We were meant to be  
And I know you feel the way I do  
I only want to be next to you  
Love came easily  
And all the feelings I just can't hide  
Makes us so close and so mystified
