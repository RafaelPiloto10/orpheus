Looking out  
Across the night-time  
The city winks a sleepless eye  
Hear his voice  
Shake my window  
Sweet seducing sighs  
2nd Verse  
Get me out  
Into the night-time  
Four walls won't hold me tonight  
If this town  
Is just an apple  
Then let me take a bite  
Chorus  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
Reaching out  
To touch a stranger  
Electric eyes are everywhere  
See that boy  
He knows I'm watching  
He likes the way I stare  
Chorus  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
I like livin' this way  
I like lovin' this way  
(Instrumental section)  
Looking out  
Across the morning  
The city's heart begins to beat  
Reaching out  
I touch her shoulder  
I'm dreaming of the street  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say -  
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
I like livin' this way  
[Repeat chorus - ad-lib and fade-out
