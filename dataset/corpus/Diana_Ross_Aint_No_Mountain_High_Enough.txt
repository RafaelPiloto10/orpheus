If you need me, call me.  
No matter where you are, no matter how far.  
Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry.  
On that you can depend and never worry.  
(you see, my love is alive it's like a seed that only needs the thought of you
to grow.  
So if you feel the need for company, please, my darling, let it be me.  
I may not be able to express the love I feel for you,  
but a writer put it very nicely when he was away from the one he loved.  
he said down and wrote these words:)  
  
No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)  
Nor winter's cold  
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)  
If you're my goal  
  
No wind, no rain,  
Can stop me, babe  
If you want to go  
  
I know, I know you must follow the sun  
Wherever it leads  
But remember  
If you should fall short of your desires  
Remember life holds for you one guarantee  
You'll always have me  
  
And if you should miss my love  
One of these old days  
If you should ever miss the arms  
That used to hold you so close, or the lips  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
Just remember what I told you  
The day I set you free  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)  
Ain't no river wild enough  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)  
Ain't no river wild enough  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Nothing can keep me  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)  
Ain't no river wild enough (say it again)  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Nothing can keep me  
To keep me from you
