It happens everyday  
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay  
Together, they decide to separate  
Just how it happens, neither is certain  
But it happens everyday  
  
It happens everyday  
After you break up, you say these words to your friends  
"How could I have loved that boy?"  
"He was so bad to me in the end"  
Well, you make him a liar  
Turn him into a robber  
Well, it happens everyday  
  
But I don't regret that I loved you  
How I loved you, I will never forget  
And in time I'll look back and remember  
The boy that I knew when we first met  
  
Still, it happens everyday  
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate  
But am I so different from that young girl you used to date?  
You used to adore me  
(You used to adore me)  
Still, it happens everyday  
  
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Everyday, yeah, yeah, yeah
