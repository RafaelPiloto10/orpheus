One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
(Ah -- --)  
  
Filled the room with flowers from Norway  
Sensed her majesty in the air  
Made a sign 'bove your doorway, to show I care  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been standing on your corner  
(Don't go away) Don't go away  
  
One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning ...
