You told me I was one in a million  
Everything you wanted in this world  
Every time I turn around  
I hear tell you paint the town  
With one of this million other girls  
  
Oh, watcha do to me is not the question  
I swear I felt the magic from the start  
I see the promise of a legendary love  
But I am not about to share your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd do almost anything just to make you mine  
But I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line waiting for your call  
I won't take a number, just to take a fall  
So make up your mind  
I won't stand in line  
  
Oh, how long do you think that you can handle  
Keeping all those hearts up in the air  
Don't you know in time you're bound to stumble  
And when that day comes it won't be my affair  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Oh, I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line
