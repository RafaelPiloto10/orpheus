I could paint your picture in the sky tonight  
Your lipstick on the moon it shines so bright  
Baby it's full and white  
Honey it's full tonight  
  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rogue  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh  
I could paint your picture in my room tonight  
Your body's on my mind it's clear and bright  
Oh but you're far away  
And what i wouldn't pay  
  
To kiss you red  
Kiss you rogue  
Kiss you rough  
Kiss you smooth  
Oh  
  
It's black out  
And I'm alone in the dark  
But light a candle to replace your heart  
What i wouldn't give to have you here in my bed  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rogue  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh  
  
To kiss you red  
Kiss you rogue  
Kiss you rough  
Kiss you smooth  
Oh  
  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rogue  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh  
  
To kiss you red  
Kiss you rogue  
Kiss you rough  
Kiss you smooth  
Oh  
  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rogue  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh
