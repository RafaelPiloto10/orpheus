Before we ever made the headlines  
Or toured the concert halls  
We survived our share of bar rooms  
Stared at many motel walls  
  
The years in Carolina  
And all the one night stands  
What kept the fires a burnin'  
Back then, was you the fans  
  
We two stepped out to Texas  
Round and round the dance hall floors  
Played the fair in Minnesota  
I wish we could've played one more  
  
We hope you remember  
We're just the boys in the band  
And what keeps the fires a burnin'  
Is always, you the fans  
  
I wish this night could last forever  
Ah, but the show must go on  
And we'll take home the memories  
And we'll leave you with our songs  
  
It's been good to see ya'll  
Can we come back again? And again, and again  
What keeps the fires a burnin'  
In us, is you the fans  
  
As long as you remember  
The boys in the band  
We'll keep the fires a burnin'  
For all of you, our fans
