Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.  
  
While shepherds kept their watching  
Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light.  
  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! Above the earth  
Rang out the angels chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth.  
  
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn...
