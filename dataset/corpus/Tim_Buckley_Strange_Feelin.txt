I got this strange strange feelin'  
Deep down in my heart  
I can't tell what it is  
But it won't let go  
It happens every time  
I give you more than what I have  
But now all I need is a little time to sing this song  
And I think we're gonna find a way to lose this strange feelin'  
  
All around I feel ya, darlin', feel ya darlin'  
When you're home all alone  
Oh, don't you need somebody to talk your troubles to  
Ah, lord I know I want to catch the morning train, lord the first thing  
Oh, I want to hear you say we're gonna take that strange feelin'  
Oh, take it all away  
  
Well it's just like a mockingbird a-singing on a hillside  
Churping at his morning song  
But don't you weep don't you fret don't you wail don't you moan  
Can't you hear that whiporwill a-callin?  
Now don't you worry  
Your daddy's comin' home  
He's gonna chase those blues away  
And believe me when I say  
We're gonna lose that strange feelin' all around all around
