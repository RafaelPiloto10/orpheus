After I stuck my  
Hands into your ground  
And pulled out  
Somebody else's son  
I felt a little unfortunate  
A little mistaken  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long  
After I bent myself to my knees  
And raised my hands up  
Right above my head  
I felt a little, little  
A little bright patch  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long  
After I took my eyes  
From the west  
And brought myself back  
To my place  
I felt a little light for awhile  
A little light stone  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long
