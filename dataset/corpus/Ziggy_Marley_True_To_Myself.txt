Life has come a long way since yesterday I say  
And its not the same old thing over again I say  
Just do what you feel and don't you fool yourself I say  
Cause I can't make you happy unless I am I say I say I  
  
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself  
  
Day in day out I've asked many questions I say  
Only to find the truth it never changes I say  
If you don't deal with it it keeps killing you a little by little I say  
Call me selfish if you will my life I alone can live I say I say I  
  
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself  
  
I don't care if it hurts I'm tired of lies and all these games  
I've reached a point in life no longer can I be this way  
Don't come crying to me I too have shed my share of tears  
I'm moving on yes I'm grooving on well I'm finally free I've  
  
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself  
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself
