A charge to keep I have,  
God to glorify.  
A never dying soul to save,  
And fit it for the sky.  
  
To serve to present age,  
My calling to fulfill.  
O may it all my powers engage  
To do my Master's will!  
  
Arm me with jealous care,  
As in Thy sight to live,  
And O, Thy servant, Lord, prepare,  
A strict account to give.  
  
Help me to watch and pray,  
And on Thyself rely.  
Assured, if I my trust betray,  
I shall forever die...
