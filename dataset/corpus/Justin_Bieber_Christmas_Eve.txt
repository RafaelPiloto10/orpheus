It's a holiday  
Spend it with you baby  
I think that I am in love this Christmas, yeah  
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace  
You know that Santa's coming to town  
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now  
  
So today is all about you babe  
The mistletoe can pull us closer  
It's what I'm waiting for  
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's  
  
So in on top of your roof  
Them sleigh bells is ringing  
I'll be up all night with you  
Don't care what they're saying  
Japan to Peru, baby me and you  
This Christmas Eve  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me  
I got you babe, whoa oh  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
You leave some cookies out,  
I'ma eat 'em up  
Nobody can see me but you  
It's so magical  
  
When we use imagination,  
We can fly to never never land  
The North Pole, ain't that cold  
If you wanna go  
I got you baby  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me  
I got you babe, whoa oh  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Christmas  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
I promise I won't do you wrong  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
(Lay your head on me)  
I got you babe (whoa no no no whoa oh)  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
