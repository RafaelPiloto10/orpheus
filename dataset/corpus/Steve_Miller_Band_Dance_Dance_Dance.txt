My grandpa, he's 95  
And he keeps on dancin'  
He's still alive  
  
My grandma, she's 92  
She loves to dance  
And sing some, too  
  
I don't know  
But I've been told  
If you keep on dancing  
You'll never grow old  
  
Come on darling  
Put a pretty dress on  
We're gonna go out tonight  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
All night long  
  
I'm a hard working man  
I'm a son of a gun  
I've been working all week in the noon day sun  
The wood's in the kitchen  
And the cow's in the barn  
I'm all cleaned up and my chores are all done  
Take my hand, come along  
Let's go out and have some fun  
  
Come on darling put a pretty dress on  
We're gonna go out tonight  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
All night long  
  
Pick on  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
All night long  
  
Come on darling, don't look that way  
Don't you know when you smile  
I've got to say you're my honey pumpkin lover  
You're my heart's delight  
Don't you want to go out tonight  
You're such a pretty lady  
You're such a sweet girl  
When you dance it brightens up my world  
Come on darling put a pretty dress on  
We're gonna go out tonight  
And dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
All night long
