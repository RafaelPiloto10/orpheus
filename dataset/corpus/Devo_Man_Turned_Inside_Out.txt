If you ever had a clue  
You never acted like you knew  
When you took away the reasons  
And you chopped my heart in two  
Once you start to doubt  
  
When you don't know what it's about  
It's time to read the warning signs  
Of a man turned inside out  
For a guy needs a good reason  
Something to prod him on  
When you chopped me up like liver  
It all started going wrong  
So I bought a fiberglass helmet  
Some goggles to match  
  
I'm a human bullet baby  
And you haven't seen the last  
Of a man turned inside out  
I'm a man turned inside out  
So I got myself a position  
And I'm working my way up  
Took a three way lucky number  
Now I'm heading for the top
