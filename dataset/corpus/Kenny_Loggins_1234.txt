1234, tell me that you love me more  
Sleepless long nights  
That is what my youth was for  
  
Old teenage hopes  
Are alive at your door  
Left you with nothing  
But they want some more  
  
Oh, you're changing your heart  
Oh, you know who you are  
  
Sweetheart, bitter heart  
Now I can tell you apart  
Cozy and cold  
Put the horse before the cart  
  
Those teenage hopes  
Who have tears in their eyes  
Too scared to own up to one little lie  
  
Oh, you're changing your heart  
Oh, you know who you are  
  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10  
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10  
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then  
  
Oh, you're changing your heart  
Oh, you know who you are  
Oh, you're changing your heart  
Oh, you know who you are  
Who you are, are, are  
  
Before, before the teenage boys  
They're breaking your heart  
Before the teenage boys  
They're breaking your heart
