What can I do, what can I say  
Running down this suspicious highway  
I can't forget how love let me down  
And when we meet it still gets in my way.  
  
But we're already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
'Cause we're already one  
Our little son won't let us forget.  
  
Your laughing eyes, your crazy smile  
Every time I look in his face  
I can't believe how love lasts a while  
And looks like "forever" in the first place.  
  
But we're already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
'Cause we're already one  
Our little son won't let us forget.  
  
In my new life I'm travelin' light  
Eyes wide open for the next move  
I can't go wrong 'til I get right  
But I'm not fallin' back in the same groove.  
  
But we're already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
'Cause we're already one  
Our little son won't let us forget.
