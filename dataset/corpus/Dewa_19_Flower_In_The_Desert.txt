Why...  
You always have something nice to say...  
And makes me sway...  
And why...  
Does my heart keep beatin fast...  
When you...  
Kiss...  
Kiss my lips...  
When all the sugar has gone...  
I don't know how...  
But you...  
Make everything feels like...  
The very first time...  
You...  
Can make a man like me...  
Fallin' in love again...  
Though loving you is breaking all the rules...  
Please...  
Tell me what to do...  
You are...  
  
You are my flower in a desert...  
That's what you are...  
Flower in a desert...  
That's what you are...  
You brings me joy and happiness...  
When I'm all alone...  
  
Why could you always make me feel the same...  
I love your way...  
Though I should have known this is just a game we play...  
Hey smiling face...  
Have you ever really loved a man...  
'Till you sway or have you just been taking all these things for granted...
