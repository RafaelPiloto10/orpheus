Mama she has taught me well  
Told me when I was young  
"Son your life's an open book  
Don't close it 'fore it's done"  
  
"The brightest flame burns quickest"  
That's what I heard her say  
A son's heart's owed to mother  
But I must find my way  
  
Let my heart go  
Let your son grow  
Mama, let my heart go  
Or let this heart be still  
Yeah, still  
  
Rebel, my new last name  
Wild blood in my veins  
Apron strings around my neck  
The mark that still remains  
  
Left home at an early age  
Of what I heard was wrong  
I never asked forgiveness  
But what is said is done  
  
Let my heart go  
Let your son grow  
Mama, let my heart go  
Or let this heart be still  
  
Never I ask of you  
But never I gave  
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave  
Never I ask of you  
But never I gave  
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave  
So let this heart be still  
  
Mama, now I'm coming home  
I'm not all you wished of me  
A mother's love for her son  
Unspoken, and helped me be  
Yeah, I took your love for granted  
And all the things you said to me  
I need your arms to welcome me  
But, a cold stone's all I see  
  
Let my heart go  
Let your son grow  
Mama, let my heart go  
Or let this heart be still  
  
Let my heart go  
Mama, let my heart go  
You never let my heart go  
So let this heart be still  
  
Never I ask of you  
But never I gave  
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave  
Never I ask of you  
But never I gave  
But you gave me your emptiness I now take to my grave  
  
So let this heart be still
