(budda pa pa Bow! Budda pa pa pow!!)  
Jesus i'll stand  
In every curcamstance  
I'll lift up  
Your name  
To save this generation  
(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!!!!)  
  
Gotta let it show  
Let the whole world know  
What you've done in me  
Coz I am not ashamed  
I will be the light  
In the darkest night  
Everyone will see  
That I am not ashamed  
No!! I am not ashamed!  
(budda pa pa Bow! Budda pa pa pow!!)  
  
Sometimes it's hard  
To know exacly what to say  
But I will stand up  
Coz you are with me all the way  
(oh your with me all the way!!)
