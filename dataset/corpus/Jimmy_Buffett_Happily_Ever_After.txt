Happily ever after (now and then)  
By: jimmy buffett  
1996  
I've been a stand-in, a stunt man  
I've takin' some falls  
Troubles... I've had my share  
But one has to learn how to run before walkin'  
'round breathin' that million air  
  
Take it from me cuz I found  
If you leave it then somebody else is bound  
To find that treasure, that moment of pleasure  
When yours, it could have been  
  
Some people never find it  
Some... Only pretend, but me:  
I just want to live happily ever after every now and then  
  
I've been in vans and in bands  
On and through stages  
One thing I can conclude  
One has to learn havin' fun is just smilin' through  
Those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes  
Take it from me cuz I've found  
If you leave it then somebody else is bound  
To find that treasure, that moment of pleasure  
When yours, it could have been  
  
Some people never find it  
Some... Only pretend, but me:  
I just want to live happily ever after every now and then  
  
... Pm guitar break...  
  
Some people never find it  
Some... Only pretend, but me, hell:  
I just want to live happily ever after every now and then  
  
Every now and then (oooooooo...)  
(every now and then) (oooooooo...)  
(happily ever after every now and then) (oooooooo...)  
(every now and then) (oooooooo...)  
(happily ever after every now and then)
