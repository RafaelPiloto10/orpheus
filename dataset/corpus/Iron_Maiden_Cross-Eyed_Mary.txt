Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief  
If he had a rich man in his hand  
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth  
If he could take it from the money man  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along  
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song  
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong  
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Cross-eyed Mary, oh Mary, oh cross-eyed mary
