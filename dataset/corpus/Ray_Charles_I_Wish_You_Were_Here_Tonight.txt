Reading old magazines,  
I'm on the road no one to save me girl,  
I wish you were here tonight,  
There's a knock on my door,  
Yes, it's time to give another show,  
I wish you were here tonight.  
Chorus  
My love is all imagination,  
Just a dream without you to make it real,  
And, baby, I got a dream,  
Burning inside,  
No one else around,  
Just you and I,  
Loving in the fire,  
It made us so right,  
And I wish you were here tonight.  
The T.V is a friend,  
'cause I can choose the show with a happy end,  
That never ends,  
Forever and ever more,  
If I make believe your on the show,  
Your the lover that says she has to go,  
And I end up wishing you were here tonight.  
Chorus
