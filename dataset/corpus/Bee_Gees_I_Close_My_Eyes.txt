Look at me I'm riding high  
Don't know what's wrong with me.  
Can't you see I'm not the guy  
That I pretend to be.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
The more I try the more I fail,  
I'd like to run away.  
But if I try you pass me by,  
I know that I can't stay.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes  
I close my eyes. [Repeat: x3]
