It's like reaching for the moon  
It's like reaching for the sun  
It's like reaching for the stars  
Reaching for you  
  
You're so far above me  
How can I expect than an angel to love me  
Who is as divine as you are  
  
It's like flying without wings  
Playing fiddle without strings  
And a million other things  
No one can do  
Though my hopes are slender  
In my secret heart I pray you'll surrender soon  
No, it's like reaching for the moon
