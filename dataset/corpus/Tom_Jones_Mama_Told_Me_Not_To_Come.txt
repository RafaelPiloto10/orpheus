Want some whiskey in your water?  
Sugar in your tea?  
What's all these crazy questions they're askin' me?  
This is the craziest party that could ever be  
Don't turn on the lights 'cause I don't want to see  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
  
Open up the window, let some air into this room  
I think momma's chocking from the smell of stale perfume  
And the cigarette you're smoking about to scare me half to death  
Open up the window, let me catch my breath  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son, son, son"  
  
Some radio is blastin'  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend  
She just passed out on the floor  
I've seen so many things  
I ain't never seen before  
Don't know what it is  
I don't want to see no more  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me)  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, no" (no, no)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mana told me, mama told me  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, no, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son" (Mama told me)  
  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun" (oh no, no)
