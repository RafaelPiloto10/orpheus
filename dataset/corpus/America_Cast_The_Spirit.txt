When you feel down and you've nobody to turn to  
When you feel you're about to give up  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
And it's runnin' dry in your lovin' cup  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
You can't ignore the feeling inside you  
In your mind you're without a friend  
The spirit is there, it's in every doorway  
You say to yourself, will it ever end  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
When you feel down and have nobody to turn to  
You say to yourself, why can't it be  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
You feel you want to be free  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit ...
