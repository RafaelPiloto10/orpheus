One day you're happy the next day you're blue  
You feel like the whole world's comin' right down on you  
There ain't nothin' wrong but then there ain't nothin' right  
It's just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night  
  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
Lord don't they hurt you when you cry  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
And when they hit the ground don't they make a terrible sound  
  
Maybe she loves you and maybe it's a joke  
And maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke  
You don't feel warm but then you don't feel cold  
You're just gettin' weary you're just gettin' old  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
  
And your mind can't take this worry and your heart feels underfed  
Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow or maybe you'll just stay in bed  
Don't call the doctor and ask his advice  
Cause he's felt the same way himself once or twice  
And there ain't no cure for the tear in your eye  
You just gotta sit there you just gotta cry  
Heavy tears in your eyes
