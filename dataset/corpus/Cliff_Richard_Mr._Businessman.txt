Itemise the things you  
Covet as you squander  
Through your life.  
Bigger cars, bigger  
Houses, term insurance  
For your wife.  
Tuesday evenings with your harlot,  
And on Wednesdays it's  
Your charlatan analyst,  
He's high upon your list.  
You got air conditioned  
Sinuses and dark, disturbing doubts  
About religion.  
And you keep those cards  
And letters going out.  
And while your  
Secretary's tempting you  
Your morals are exepting  
You from guilt and shame,  
Heaven knows  
You're not to blame!  
You better take care of  
Business, Mr. Businessman,  
What's your plan?  
Get down to business,  
Mr. Businessman, if you can  
Before it's too late,  
And they throw your life away.  
Did you see your children  
Growing up today,  
And did you hear the  
Music of their laughter  
As they set about to play?  
And did you smell the  
Fragrance of those roses  
In your garden?  
Did the morning sunlight  
Warm your soul and  
Brighten up your day?  
Do you qualify to be  
Alive or is the limit  
Of your senses  
So as only to survive?  
Spending counterfeit  
Incentive, wasting  
Precious time and health.  
Placing values on the  
Worthless, disregarding  
Priceless wealth.  
Well, you can wheel and  
Deal the best of them  
And steal it from the rest of them.  
You know the score,  
Their ethics are a bore.  
86 proof anesthetic crutches  
Brought you to the top  
Where the smiles are all synthetic  
And the ulcers never stop  
When they take that final inventory  
Yours will be the same  
Sad story everywhere -  
No one will really care. no one more lonely than  
This rich important man.  
Let's have your autograph  
ENDORSE your epitaph!  
You better take care...  
................if you can!
