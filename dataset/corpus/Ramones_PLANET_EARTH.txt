The solution to peace isn't clear the terrorist  
Thret is a modern fear there are no jobs for the young  
They turn to crime turn to drugs battle ships crowd the sea  
16 year old in the army our jails are filled  
To the max discrimination against the blacks  
Russian and american war machine will destroy mankind's  
Dream they shoot their missiles in the air they do not  
Care they do not care guerrila armies rule the street  
No more Christmas or trick or treat is this what  
The future will bring I pray for peace more than anything  
The solution to peace isn't clear the terrorist threat  
Is a modern fear there is no future for the youth  
There is no hope for the young death destruction  
Bombs galore the rich are laughning at the poor  
Our jails are filled to the max  
Discrimination agains the blacks
