You might say you're pretty  
You might say you're free  
Life may be so easy  
Love may be so free  
Cover the road, coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
You might say you're ugly  
You might say you're chained  
Life may be so dreary  
Love may be sa shame  
Cover the road, coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
Cover the road, coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
Life is a highway  
You're sitting on the wheel  
And you decide to speed  
Here is the easy and there is the hard way  
It's either one  
Cover the road ...  
You might say you're ugly  
You might say you're chained  
It's inside your heart lady  
Where the battle is won  
Cover the road ...
