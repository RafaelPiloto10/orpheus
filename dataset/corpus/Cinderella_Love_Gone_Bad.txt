If I hear you stalkin'  
Looking for sympathy  
You just keep on walkin'  
Actin' like you don't know me  
Ain't nothin' new for you  
Honey what you put me through  
Seven years ago today  
There ain't no other way  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddy's eye  
  
But your love  
Your love's gone bad  
Yea, yea, yea  
Your love  
Your love's gone bad  
  
If I hear you talkin'  
Gettin' in my ear  
Listen to the words I say  
Let me make this very clear  
Don't ask for money  
Don't you think my name  
Everything was sunny  
Dream about it ain't the same  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddy's eye  
  
But your love  
Your love's gone bad  
Yea, yea, yea  
Your love  
Your love's gone bad  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddy's eye  
  
But your love  
Your love's gone bad  
Yea, yea, yea  
Your love  
Your love's gone bad your love  
Your love's gone bad  
Yea, yea, yea  
Your love's gone bad  
  
Your love's gone bad  
Your love's gone bad  
So bad
