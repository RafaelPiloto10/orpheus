You can live your life on the edge of your seat  
You can take your place down on easy street  
Or just lose your mind  
Over things only money can buy  
But it's a fact of life no matter what you do  
Every stake you claim, every dream come true  
Down deep inside, these kinda things never satisfy  
Oh, love is the precious thing  
Set you free and give your heart the wings to fly  
Love is the living dream  
Callin' your name  
Tellin' you somethin' 'cause you  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
You can conquer the world, but it's never enough  
Because you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
  
You can carry the flame across the finish line  
You can sign your name in the sands of time  
But fortune and fame they're just things that ya leave behind  
Well, you think you got the world in the palm of your hand  
But there's one thing missin' in your promised land  
It's a thing called love, the one thing that your heart demands  
Oh, love is the rhythm of life  
In your soul is where the secret lies  
When love is lookin' through your eyes  
Every feelin' inside  
Is tellin' you somethin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can chase your dreams down the yellow brick road  
Sail full steam down the river of gold  
If you ever get it all, you never get enough  
'Cause you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
Oh, love is the precious thing  
Set you free and give your heart the wings to fly  
Callin' your name, oh
