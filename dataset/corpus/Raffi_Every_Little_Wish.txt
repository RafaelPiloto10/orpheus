Every little wish and every little dream  
Has a chance of coming true at Christmas  
Every little song sung throughout the year  
Has a chance of being heard at Christmas  
Every little prayer and every little hope  
Is the joy of Christmas time  
All our loving hearts, beating all as one  
Everybody felt there's enough to go around  
All our loving hearts, beating all as one  
The joy of Christmas time  
Every little wish and every little dream  
Has a chance of coming true at Christmas  
Every little song sung throughout the year  
Has a chance of being heard at Christmas  
Every little prayer and every little hope  
Is the joy of Christmas time  
All our loving hearts, beating all as one  
Everybody felt there's enough to go around  
All our loving hearts, beating all as one  
The joy of Christmas time
