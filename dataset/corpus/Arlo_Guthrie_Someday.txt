Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I will be with you  
Someday we will meet again  
When we meet, I'll see you then  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
It will make this farewell seem  
Little more than but a dream  
If you only knew  
Dreams are often true  
Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
Someday when we meet again  
When we meet our sorrows end  
If you only knew
