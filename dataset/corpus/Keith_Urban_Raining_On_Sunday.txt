It ticks just like a Timex  
It never lets up on you  
Who said life was easy?  
The job is never through  
  
It'll run us till we're ragged  
It'll harden our hearts  
And love could use a day of rest  
Before we both start falling apart  
  
[Chorus]  
Pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we've got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
  
Your love is like religion  
A cross in Mexico  
And your kiss is like the innocence  
Of a prayer nailed to a door  
  
Oh surrender is much sweeter  
When we both let it go  
Let the water wash our bodies clean  
And love wash our souls  
  
And pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
And baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we've got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
  
Pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
When it's raining on Sunday  
When it's raining on Sunday  
Let it rain
