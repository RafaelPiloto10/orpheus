Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna shoot you right down  
Take you in my arms  
I'm in love with you  
A love that is true  
Boom boom boom boom  
  
I need you right now  
I mean right now  
I don't mean tomorrow  
I mean right now  
Come on come on  
I wanna give it up babe  
  
Shake it up babe  
Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe  
  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
When you walk that walk  
And you talk that talk  
You knock me out  
Right over my feet  
  
Shake it up babe  
Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna shoot you right down  
Take you in my arms  
I'm in love with you  
A love that is true  
Boom boom boom boom
