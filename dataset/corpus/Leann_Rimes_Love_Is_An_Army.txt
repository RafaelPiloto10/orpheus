Fear is an army  
Fighting against me  
Fighting a lost cause  
If I could only change their uniform  
They'd be soldiers of love  
Marching on and on  
  
Love is an army  
Waiting for me  
Waiting for this girl  
If I could only stretch my arms around you  
I'd suddenly see  
There ain't nothin' wrong with me  
Hear  
  
[Chorus]  
Words fly out  
The roof of my mouth  
They found a flaw  
In my armor  
Heart so still  
Your beating will  
Heal the wars I remembr,  
remember  
  
Blue is the ocean  
Calling me in  
Calling me near  
If I could learn  
To breathe down here  
I know I would be  
At home under the sea  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll bend my sword  
Against the world  
I'll push on through  
In spite of you  
  
Love is an army  
Waiting for me  
Waiting for this girl
