Look through any window, yeah  
What do you see?  
Smiling faces all around,  
Rushing through the busy town.  
Where do they go?  
Moving on their way,  
Walking down highways and the by-ways  
Where do they go?  
Moving on their way,  
People with their shy ways and their sly ways  
Oh, you can see the little children all around.  
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns, when you  
Look through any window, yeah,  
Any time of day  
See the drivers on the roads  
Pulling down their heavy loads  
Where do they go?  
Moving on their way,  
Driving down highways and the byways  
Where do they go?  
Moving on their way,  
Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways  
Oh, you can see the little children all around.  
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns, when you  
Look through any window, yeah,  
What do you see?  
Smiling faces all around,  
Rushing through the busy town.  
Where do they go?  
Moving on their way  
Moving on their way  
Moving on their way
