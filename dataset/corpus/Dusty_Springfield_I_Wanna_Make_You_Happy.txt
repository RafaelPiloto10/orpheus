What a nice party  
And I know just why I'm feeling so new  
'Cause I came along and I found you  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight  
  
It's just like magic  
Dancing with you  
While we're sharing a kiss  
Oh, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight, and every day I live, yeah  
I want to give you all I have to give  
Oh, I want to make you so happy, yeah, oh  
  
Yes, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you so happy, child  
Come on, I want to make you so
