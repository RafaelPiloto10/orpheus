What you gonna tell your dad  
It's like a wheel of fortune  
And what you gonna tell your dad  
If this wheel lets you down  
My love is my engine  
And you might be fuel  
Stop acting cool  
Just bet you might win  
I'm not too cool  
(I'm in love with another fool)  
  
Don't push me  
I don't what to can't you see it  
Hasten slowly  
And don't count your chicks  
Before there hatched baby  
  
What you gonna tell your  
  
Hey you,  
We're gonna make you move  
It tastes like steel  
Like a stab from a knife  
  
What you gonna tell your,  
I'm on love with another fool  
  
I'm in love with you I like your style  
I want you I'm in love  
  
What you gonna tell your
