Day after day I'm more confused  
But I look for the light through the pourin' rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
I'm feelin' the strain  
Ain't it a shame?  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock-'n'-roll and drift away  
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock-'n'-roll and drift away  
  
Beginin' to think that I'm wastin time  
And I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you to carry me through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me  
  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in the song  
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You helped me along  
You're makin' me strong  
  
[Chorus]
