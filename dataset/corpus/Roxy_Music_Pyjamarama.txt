Couldn't sleep a wink last night  
Oh how I'd love to hold you tight  
They say you have a secret life  
Made sacrifice your key to paradise  
Never mind, take the world by storm  
Just boogaloo a rhapsody divine  
Take a sweet girl just like you  
How nice if only we could bill and coo  
I may seem a fool to you for everything I say or think or do  
How could I apologies for all those lies  
The world may keeps us far apart but up in heaven, angel  
You can have my heart  
Diamonds may be your best friend  
But like laughter after tears  
I'll follow you to the end
