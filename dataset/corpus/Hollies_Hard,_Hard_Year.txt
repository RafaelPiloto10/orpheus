Bad times, something's wrong  
Money's gone, I'm on my own  
Can't stay, there's nothing here  
It's been a hard, hard year  
  
First month, snows came  
Put me in bed, couldn't work the same  
Job's gone, bills are here  
Been a hard, hard year  
  
I look on the bad side of life  
I lose heart then I want to die  
So I've got to get back on my feet  
And prove to myself I'm a man  
  
I hope that the bad times are gone  
It's been work, but I think that I've won  
Now I'm happy  
And I'll never be that way again  
No, I'll never be that way again  
  
Snow's gone, spring's here  
Won't happen twice, I've seen my way clear  
Everyone's paid, got no one to fear  
Been a hard, hard year
