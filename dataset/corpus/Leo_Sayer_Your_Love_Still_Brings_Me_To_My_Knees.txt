Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
This flame that burns  
Within my heart will never die  
Oh I bless the day you come along  
You turned my life into a song  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
Brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
I find each day I love you more  
Always the one I'm waiting for  
No matter where I go  
No matter what I do  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
Still brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
You bring me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Now I never knew  
What life was all about, yeah  
Then you came along  
And gave me a reason to understand what it's about, oh darling  
  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
It brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Still brings me to my knees  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
You've given me everything  
Given me everything, darling
