You have one letter left to send  
With no beginning and no end  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark, oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
There is no sunshine in your eyes  
You make no sound and yet you cry  
It's not the double cross  
You feel the love you lost, oh no  
This letter has to say goodbye  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free

I hope you find some reason to be free
