I'm seeing you for the last time.  
You've been untrue for the last time.  
I know that you've been usin' me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time for me.  
  
I found you and that love for the first time.  
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.  
  
I'm seein' you for the last time.  
I've been a fool for the last time.  
You only strung along with me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time for me.  
  
I found you and that love for the first time.  
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.  
  
I'm seein' you for the last time.  
I've been a fool for the last time.  
You only strung along with me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time,  
The first time it's the last time,
