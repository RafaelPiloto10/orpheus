Sock it to me  
Floatin' down the river  
With a saturated liver  
And I wish I could forgive her  
But I do believe she meant it  
When she told me to forget it  
And I bet she will regret it  
When they find me in the morning wet and drowned  
And the word gets 'round.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
Comin' up for air  
It's pretty stuffy under there  
I'd like to say I didn't care  
But I forgot to leave a note  
And it's so hard to stay afloat  
I'm soakin' wet without a boat  
And I knew I should have taken off my shoes  
It's front page news.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
I wish I had another drink  
It wouldn't be so hard to sink  
I should have taken time to think  
Besides I got the picture straight  
She must have had another date  
I didn't need this extra weight  
I wish that I could see the way to shore  
I don't want no more.  
Goin' down, I'm goin' down.  
  
And now I see the life I led  
I slept it all away in bed  
I should have learned how to swim instead  
And now it's really got me stumped  
I can't believe I really jumped  
I'd like to get my tummy pumped  
I can't believe they drink this stuff in town  
This dirty brown.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
I wished I'd looked before I leaped  
I didn't know it was so deep  
Been down so far I don't get wet  
Haven't touched the bottom yet  
This river scene is gettin' old  
I'm hungry, sleepy, wet and cold  
She told me to forget it nice  
I should have taken her advice  
I only want to go on home  
I'd gladly leave that girl alone  
What a way to spend the night  
If I don't drown, I'll die of fright  
My pappy taught me how to float  
But I can't swim a single note  
He threw me in to teach me how  
I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow  
And now I've floated way downstream  
I know this has to be a dream  
If I could find my way to shore  
I'd never, never do this anymore  
I'll give you three, I've been down nine  
I'm goin' down just one more time.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
Now the sky is gettin' light  
An everything will be all right  
Think I finally got the knack  
Just floatin' here lazy on my back  
I never really liked that town  
I think I'll ride the river down  
Just movin' slow and floatin' free  
There's a river swinging under me.  
Waving back to the folks on shore  
I should have thought of this before  
I'm floatin' down to New Orleans  
Goin' to pick up on some swingin' scenes  
I know I'll know a better day  
I'll go down groovin' all the way.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.
