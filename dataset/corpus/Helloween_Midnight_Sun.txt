Tried so hard to understand all of your feelings  
Tried to cope with your insanities  
Come to think about too many ways of healing  
What we lost or maybe never had  
  
One small step into the hidden decoy  
One more world is help and one will destroy  
  
I woke up in the midnight sun  
So aware damage has been done  
Agony or sanctuary  
Only fate will show the way  
  
From the bright of day into the jaw of darkness  
One is shoved, a victim of lie  
Friendly face turns into a fiery grimace  
Suddenly feelings learn to die  
  
Used up sympathy no chance to return  
To a world one know but would's that will burn  
  
Spent more time in the midnight sun  
Still aware of what else has gone  
Agonized and hypnotized  
When will I be shown the way  
  
Fell asleep and no midnight sun  
Still aware justice has been done  
No more doubts but disbelief  
When the night was day  
Celebration, miracle  
And fate did show the way
