I have changed, nothing like I used to be  
I have changed, darling, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, was love blinded and I couldn't see  
I sat down a many evening with my mind in a total ruin  
Wondering where on earth you were and what you might be doing  
But I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you was love blinded and I couldn't see  
I have waited for you at morning, right behind a sleepless night  
But now my eyes are wide open and I see you wasn't right  
Yes, I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, I was love blinded and I couldn't see  
If you still love me baby, you gonna have to come across  
We will tear off together so there will be no loving lost  
'Cause I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, was love blinded and I couldn't see
