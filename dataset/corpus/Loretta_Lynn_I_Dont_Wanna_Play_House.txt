Today I sat alone at the window and I watched our little girl outside at play  
With the little boy next door like so many times before  
But somethin' didn't seem quite right today  
So I went outside to see what they were doing  
  
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim  
'Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame  
When I heard our little girl say to him  
I don't want to play house I know it can't be fun  
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done  
I don't want to play house it makes my mommy cry  
'Cause when she played house, my daddy said goodbye  
I don't want to play house...
