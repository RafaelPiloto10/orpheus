(Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah, ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)  
  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know the way I feel tonight (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know this feeling ain't right (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
  
There goes my baby, there goes my heart  
They're gone forever, so far apart  
But only the lonely know wh-why-why I cry, only the lonely  
(Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah, ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)  
  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know the heartaches I've been through (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know I cry and cry for you (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
  
Maybe tomorrow a new romance  
No-o-o more sorrow, but that's the chance  
You've got to take, if your lonely heart breaks  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)
