Now look here Joe, quit acting smart  
Stop being that old brazen sort  
Don't you go sellin' this country short  
No, no Joe  
  
Just because you think you've found  
The system that we know ain't sound  
Don't you go throwin' your weight around  
No, no Joe  
  
'Cause the Kaiser tried it and Hitler tried it  
Mussolini tried it too  
Now they're all sittin' around a fire and did you know something?  
They're saving a place for you  
  
Now Joe you ought to get it clear  
You can't push folks around with fear  
'Cause we don't scare easy over here  
No, no Joe  
  
What makes you do the things you do?  
You gettin' folks mad at you  
Don't bite off more'n you can chew  
No, no Joe  
  
'Cause you want a scrap that you can't win  
You don't know what you're getting in  
Don't go around leading with your chin  
No, no Joe  
  
Now you got tanks, some fair size tanks  
But you're acting like a clown  
'Cause man we've got Yanks, a mess of Yanks  
And you might get caught with your tanks down  
  
Don't go throwin' out your chest  
You'll pop the buttons off your vest  
You're playing with a hornets' nest  
No, no Joe  
  
You know, you think you're somebody we should dread  
Just because you're seein' red  
You better get that foolishness out of your head  
No, no Joe  
  
And you might be itchin' for a fight  
Quit braggin' about how your bear can bite  
'Cause you're sitting on a keg of dynamite  
No, no Joe
