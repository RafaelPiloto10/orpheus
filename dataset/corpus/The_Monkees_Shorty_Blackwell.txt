I'm feeling very bad today  
Another cat came into stay  
He's eating all my food  
He's speaking very rude  
He's gonna change the mood  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
A red balloon got in my way  
It followed me around  
But never touched the ground  
What can I say?  
  
He built a house upon a hill  
Ask him if he's happy and then give him a pill  
He's going mad  
He bought another car today  
Ask him if he's happy, then turn the other way  
He's going mad (repeat over and over)  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
Another cat came into stay  
He's eating all my food  
He's speaking very rude  
He's gonna change the mood  
  
Black and shiny now you've finally  
Gotten everything you've wanted  
And you're taunted by the power  
That you really don't want anymore  
  
Everybody's talking faster  
Hurry up get me a master  
I don't have much time to lose  
And besides I'm polishing my shoes  
  
Crossing the street  
Watching your feet  
Or you'll die in a thunderbird light  
Wishing with all of your might  
That you read the newspaper that  
You forgot to buy today  
How will you know what they do when they say  
Say(repeat over and over)  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
Another girl came by to stay  
I can't think of a word  
To tell you what I've heard  
I've been away [Repeat x10]  
  
I am my?
