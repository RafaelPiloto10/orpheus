Tuesday night, I was laid up in the bed  
Tired as hell, I'm hearing voices in my head  
Heard some knocks, grabbed my tone, ran to the doe (door)  
Screamed, "Who is it?", but i ain't hear that shit no mo'  
Cocked my nine  
I went to peekin' out the blinds  
Thought it was fine  
But at a unexpected time  
The doe (door) flew in, I got a two-story home  
Seen 'em comin' wit they face masks on  
Bust the choppers, down the stairs, they hit the cut  
Two of them got away, but the other two got stuck  
Hit 'em again  
One in the neck, one in the chin  
Then called the Law and said I did they ass in  
Hook:  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
Say whodie, you won't believe what happened to me  
A nigga all in my spot, and he askin' for me  
See I wouldn't at the spot, but my broad was there  
When she hit me on the phone, it's niggas in there  
They knocked me off for a bird and my platinum chain  
Them niggas from round there, they just doin' they thang  
I respect the game  
But they got to respect it, I ain't no hoe ass nigga  
I'm gone take car my business  
Next day, broad-daylight, rode the track  
The first nigga looked suspicious had to get in the back  
(Talking)  
Bitch, we ain't straight no mo'  
Hoe we used to have fun, we don't play no mo'  
Them niggas that you run wit, they kicked in my doe  
So I'm gone shoot you in yo face if you don't cough up that dope, bitch  
Hook  
This situation is a cold thang  
I got to explain  
Cause nigga this a cold game  
I was keeping my pounds at a spot in Raleigh  
But I was moving them thangs, like they was hot tamales  
Well, hot tamales, I played the cards I was dealt  
Because I knew befo' long that they'll hang they self  
I ain't no fool  
Nigga that's why I play it cool  
I know the shit you will and won't try to do  
But what you came in wit, that's what you left wit (AHH HAA)  
Because I'm three steps ahead, it's like you brainless  
I been fuckin' wit money, I been having birds  
I disassociated my self from bad nerves  
Cause once you under pressure, you'll bust trick  
And you the type of nigga that I can't trust bitch  
And the nigga that went, you just a send-out  
I tried to kill yo hoe ass, but you went out, the window, bitch  
Hook
