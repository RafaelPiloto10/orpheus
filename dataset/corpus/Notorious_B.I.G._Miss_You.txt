[Notorious B.I.G.]  
Yeah, dedicatin this to my nigga O  
We miss you nigga  
Goin out to all the niggas that died in the struggle  
Word up, shit is real in the field  
You know, sparkin blunts to all you niggaz  
Word up  
  
Each and every day  
The daydreams of how we used to be  
See your family  
And that baby's lookin just like you  
Why'd you go away  
I've been missin you lately  
Tell me why you're gone and through  
  
[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]  
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour  
Got my man a beat down to the third power  
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour  
Got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour  
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven  
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin  
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon  
We was king till the G's crept in  
And now I'm missin em  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh, I'm missin you  
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns  
Ooh, I'm missin you  
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why  
  
[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]  
We work all week, we dancin, play the movies  
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies  
Made a killin, even though the D's knew me  
Eventually, you know they try to do me  
Fuck it  
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south  
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth  
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route  
Few months, he got his brain blown out  
Now I'm stressed  
His baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me  
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be  
Kinda topsy turvy  
You win some, you lose some  
Damn, they lost a brother  
They mother lost a son  
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?  
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried  
I look in the sky and ask God why  
Can't look his baby girls in the eye  
Damn I miss you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.]  
There was this girl around the way that make cats drool  
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool  
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool  
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school  
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries  
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me  
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be  
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her  
Then she started messin with some major players  
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers  
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya  
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her  
One night, across from the corner store  
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four  
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door  
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for  
We missin her  
  
[Chorus]
