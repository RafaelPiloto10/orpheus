Maybe you're just too upset inside  
To give it to me straight  
Maybe you've become too angry and too close to crying  
To say anything I can understand  
Or maybe you're just coming in over my head  
Maybe you're just too upset inside  
Too upset inside  
  
How can it hurt if I don't understand  
How can it hurt if I don't understand  
  
You're never gonna square with me I know  
So what is there to say?  
There's a million words that we could share tonight  
Why do you walk away?  
And I could write you off and it's over with  
Like a damaged car I can't afford to fix  
But everything inside me wants to heal your pain  
You won't explain, you won't explain.  
  
How can it hurt if I don't understand  
How can it hurt if I don't understand  
How can I help if I don't understand.  
  
How can it hurt, how can it hurt  
Well I don't understand
