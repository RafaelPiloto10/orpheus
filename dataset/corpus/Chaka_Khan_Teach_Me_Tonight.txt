Did you say that I've got a lot to learn  
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn  
Since this is the perfect spot to learn  
Teach me tonight  
  
Starting with the ABC of it  
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it  
Help me solve the mystery of it  
Teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above you  
And if a shooting star goes by  
I'll use that star to write "I love you"  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing isn't very clear my love  
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love  
Graduation's almost here my love  
You'd better teach me tonight  
  
I've played loves scenes in a flick or two  
And I've also met a chick or two  
But I still can learn a trick or two  
Hey teach me tonight  
  
I who thought I knew the score of it  
Kind of think I should know much more of it  
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it  
Hey teach me tonight  
  
The midnight hours come slowly creeping  
When there's no one there but you  
There must be more to life than sleeping  
Single in a bed for two  
  
What I need most is post graduate  
What I feel is hard to articulate  
If you want me to matriculate  
You'd better teach me tonight  
  
What do you get for lessons  
Teach me, come on and teach me, teach me tonight
