Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long  
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, but now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.  
  
I don't really know her, I only know her name  
But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know  
She's got something you just can't trust  
It's something mysterious  
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.  
  
She don't like losing, to her it's still a game  
Though she'll mess up your life, you'll want her just the same, now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
