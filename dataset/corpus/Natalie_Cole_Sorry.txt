We used to be so very happy and we used to have so much fun  
And we used to spend our time together, we were as close as anyone  
I used to feel your every feeling, I was a part of your every dream  
  
I'm not saying that you've thrown me aside, but oh that's just the way that it
seems  
So if Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,  
Wanna say I'm sorry, darling, I'm so sorry  
And if I said anything that I shouldn't have said, I'm sorry, sorry, yeah  
Now were just getting used to a brand new situation  
  
And I found out that temptation just wont let ya do good  
So we must sit down and talk and be for real to each other  
Cause I don't want my love for you to be misunderstood  
If Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,  
I'm sorry, oh baby, I'm so sorry, if I said anything that I shouldn't have
said  
  
(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh lordy I'm so sorry  
(sorry) sorry, sorry, hey (sorry), if Ive (if Ive done anything) done anything  
I (that I shouldn't have done) shouldn't have done  
  
(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry, (if I said anything) if I, if I said
anything I  
(that I shouldn't have said) shouldn't have said well I'm so  
(I'm sorry) sorry, sorry, sorry, (if Ive done anything)  
I'm really, really sorry, baby, (that I shouldn't have done)  
  
Ooh baby, I'm (I'm sorry) sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm (if I said anything) sorry,
I'm sorry  
(that I shouldn't have said) I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, really sorry  
I'm so sorry, yeah, sorry, I'm so sorry, sorry
