Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
And a wish's just a dream, wish to come true  
  
If only I could have a puppy, I'd call myself so very lucky  
Just to have some company to share a cup of tea with me  
  
I'd take my puppy everywhere, la, la, la, la I wouldn't care  
Then we'll stay away from crowds with signs that say no dogs allowed  
Oh we, I know he'd never bite me, we, I know he'd never bite me  
  
If only I could have a friend who sticks with me until the end  
And walk along beside the sea to share a bit of moon with me  
  
I'd take my friend most everywhere, la, la, la, la I wouldn't care  
And we'll stay away from crowds with signs that say no friends allowed  
Oh we, we'd be so happy to be, we, we'd be so happy to be together  
  
But dreams are nothing more than wishes  
And a wish's just a dream, you wish to come true  
  
Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
(Your wish will come true)  
And a wish's just a dream  
(Your wish will come true)  
Your wish to come true  
(Your wish will come true)  
  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish will come true  
  
Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
(Your wish will come true)  
And a wish's just a dream  
(Your wish will come true)  
Your wish to come true  
(Your wish will come true)
