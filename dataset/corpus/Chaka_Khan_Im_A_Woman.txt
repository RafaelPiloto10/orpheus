I am a species born to die  
Understanding this, i hardly cry  
Growin' up and out, i'll marry you  
I'll bear your kids and be your mama too cause  
  
Chorus:  
Cause i'm a woman and i'm a backbone  
I'm a woman and i'm a backbone  
  
Everybody needs one  
  
Goin' on i live from day to day  
Give a little heart for my life to pay  
Smile and then i need to cry  
Never knowin' if i lie (or die)  
  
Chorus  
  
Understand you will not see me down  
Both of my feet are on the ground  
Come lay your head upon my chest  
I'll love you hard, i'll give my best
