[Master P]  
(LBC, New Orleans ha ha) Yo dog, uh  
  
[Snoop]  
Sup P?  
  
[Master P:]  
(Ha ha) That's some real shit  
(Where the hot boys at,  
Where the hot girls at) [Repeat: x6]  
Ya heard me?  
Ya heard me?  
The game is to be sold not to be told, ha ha  
Now this No Limit shit, No Limit nigga  
Everybody want to know how this shit happens, but we ain't playa hatin  
And what's goin on, but ya know what?  
It don't get no realer than this though dog  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
West-side niggas getting bout it,  
I said East-side niggas getting rowdy,  
Mid-west niggas getting bout it,  
South-side niggas getting rowdy (yea)  
  
[Snoop]  
Fuck that man, the game is to be sold, not to be told, first things first  
I'm a gangsta, nigga, so I'ma roll  
Ya got to get bout it or without it  
I had to shake the spot cause the game got crowded  
I'm devoted and quote it, I'm rowdy and bout it  
A No Limit Soldier, and happy to shout it  
Got this tank on my neck, got my tech. on deck  
I slap raps at your caps and try to make my snaps  
Nick-Nack patty-wack big happy sack, the dealer is back  
And I'm ridin' through your neighborhood dippin' in my Cadillac  
I'm selling this shit, I ain't telling this shit  
I'm a motherfucking two-time felon ya bitch  
From the cold hearted streets of the LBC  
To a mansion in the south down the street from my nigga P  
See, real niggas recognize the realness  
Put ya motherfucking choppers up if ya feel this  
(Bust one) Now bust one (gun shot) Not just one (two gun shots)  
And if ya want some get some, I bet we got some  
Busta's discuss us, niggas poppin all the Ying-Yang  
Still the Dogg Pound Gang (DPG, Man)  
Beats still funky, Beats by the Pound in the house,  
At the mutha fuckin door  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop]  
(Getting rowdy) Everybody in the game, say the same  
Is Snoop's still that gang bang cocaine nigga slanging everything  
I'm trying to get as much as I need  
While I fuck with these out of town hoes blowing all they weed (shut up)  
Parlaying, so what ya saying  
Bring a couple buddies wit ya, girl we ain't playin  
Baby must miss read me, cause she miss lead me  
Has some niggas come by later (what?) and try to spray me (bitch)  
But I'm just to quick, slick and sly  
When it's time to ride I let the bullets fly cause it's do or die (die die)  
I wear blue seven days out the week (for life)  
I mob the street, DP, while I'm holding my heat  
I want to warn you, shit they got killers on the East, Mid-West, up North,
down  
South in California  
So if you got your chrome, you need to stay in the zone  
And get a vest for your motherfucking dome  
Cause it's on like a dog with out his bone  
I'm in it to win it and No Limit is my home (for life for life)  
Nigga, real niggas recognize the realness  
Put ya motherfucking choppers up if ya feel this  
(Bust one) Now bust one (gun shot) Not just one (two gun shots)  
And if ya want some get some, (what up what up) I bet we got some (got some)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[Master P]  
Nigga, bout it bout it ha ha  
Snoop Dogg, Master P, and the whole No Limit mutha fuckin family nigga  
From the South to the West to the East to the middle  
To the motherfucking world!  
Ha ha real niggas and bitches unite
