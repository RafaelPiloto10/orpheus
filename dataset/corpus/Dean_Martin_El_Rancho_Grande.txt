I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Give me my ranch and my cattle  
Far from the greed city's rattle  
Give me a big herd to battle  
For I just love herding the cattle  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Give me my bridle and saddle  
And my old pinto I'll straddle  
I'll get the cowboys a-riding  
Out where the rustlers are hiding  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Sometimes the winter storms tearing  
Set all the cattle a-rearing  
But when the winter is over  
We're sure enough in the clover  
  
Alla en la rancho grande  
Alla donde vivia  
Habia una ranche rita  
Que alegre me decia  
Que alegre me decia
