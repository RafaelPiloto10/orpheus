In a little pine grove by the old home  
There's someone who's restin' alone  
And there on the the tomb, these words I read  
The words were, 'Mother Is Gone'  
Mother is gone to her home  
Way up in Heaven above  
And my heart's so sad  
For the words I read there  
The words were, 'Mother Is Gone'  
As I stood alone with memories of home  
The place I left long, long ago  
I returned home but I waited too long  
For the words read, 'Mother Is Gone'  
My friends did say, before she went away  
She called my name over and over  
So trustin' in God's love, I'll meet her above  
Over on that other shore  
Mother is gone to her home  
Way up in heaven above  
And my heart's so sad  
For the words I read there  
The words were, 'Mother Is Gone'
