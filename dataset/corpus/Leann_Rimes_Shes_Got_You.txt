I've got your picture  
That you gave to me  
And it's signed with love  
Just like it used to be  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got your picture  
She's got you  
  
I've got the records  
That we used to share  
And they still sound the same  
As when you were here  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got the records  
She's got you  
  
I've got your memory I really don't know but I know  
It won't let me be  
I've got your class ring  
That proved you cared  
And it still looks the same  
As when you gave it dear  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got these little things  
She's got you  
  
I've got your memory  
Or has it got me?  
I really don't know but I know  
It won't let me be  
  
I've got your class ring  
That proved you cared  
And it still looks the same  
As when you gave it dear  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got these little things  
She's got you  
  
I've got these little things  
She's got you
