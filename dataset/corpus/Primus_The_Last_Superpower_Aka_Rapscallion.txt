I got blood in my gas tank,  
Bones in my steel.  
I eat California condor for my Thanksgiving meal.  
I'm the last superpower.  
  
I'm the son of a loaded gun.  
I'm Rapscallion.  
When I was young and shiny boy.  
I tried to dig my way to China.  
  
I met the Rapscallion.  
En route from South Carolina.  
Then he told me I don't like,  
I don't like you.  
  
He said I'm searching for a colored man.  
I said what colors have you seen?  
He said I seen'em black and brown and red.  
But, but, but the one I seek is green.  
  
Then he told me I don't like,  
I don't like you.  
I'm Rapscallion.
