I do believe in you and I know you believe in me, oh yeah, oh yeah.  
And now we realize love's not all that it's supposed to be, oh yeah, oh yeah.  
And knowing that you would have wanted it this way,  
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day.  
  
I know we really tried, together we had a love inside, oh yeah, oh yeah.  
So now the time has come for both of us to live on the run. Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
And knowing that you would have wanted it this way,  
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day.  
  
After what you've meant to me, ooh baby now, I can make it easily.  
I know that we both agree the best thing to happen to you  
Is the best thing that happened to me.  
  
Feelin' stronger every day, feelin' stronger every day.  
Feelin' stronger every day (you know I'm alright now),  
Feelin' stronger every day (you know I'm alright now)...
