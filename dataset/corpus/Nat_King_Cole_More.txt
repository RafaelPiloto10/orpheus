More  
Than the greatest love the world  
Has known,  
  
This  
Is the love I'll give to you  
Alone.  
  
More  
Than the simple words  
I've tried to say,  
I'll only live to love you  
More each day.  
  
More than you'll ever know,  
My arms long to hold you so.  
My life will be in your keeping,  
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
  
Longer  
Than always is a long, long time,  
But far beyond forever,  
You'll be mine.  
I know I've never lived before,  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more.  
  
I know I've never lived before,  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more.
