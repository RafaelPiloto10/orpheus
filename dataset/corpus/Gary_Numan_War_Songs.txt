I like new fashion  
I like old stories  
Like my sister used to tell  
This is the voice  
This is the picture  
I like romantics  
But I don't like Steven  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
I like the welcome  
I like my sunbed  
But it burns me alive  
I like old heroes  
I like old film stars  
Dirty pictures, snap snap  
I like intrusion  
When she's dressed in white  
A nervous bride  
I don't remember  
If she's black or white  
This is the heart  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
This could be it  
This could be nothing  
Will you remember  
When the sparkle dies down  
I like Ferraris  
I like the fame  
Appreciation in the strangest ways  
I could believe  
In such things for now  
Don't like to crash, climb, climb  
I like the dancer  
Like you're supposed to  
I'll keep my mouth shut  
But I don't like this  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn
