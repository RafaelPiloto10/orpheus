Are you ready for me?  
Yeah?

No, nothing will stop it  
You can waste your time  
Yeah, you feel desire  
You made up your mind  
  
Pre - chorus:  
Feel it  
Taste the victory  
Feel it burning  
Burning inside of me  
  
Chorus:  
Right now (Hey!)  
I will be your champion  
This is where we belong  
Making it happen now! (Hey!)  
Nothing will stop us  
Won't pull us under  
It's gonna start right now!  
  
There is no end to this, no  
As far as I can see  
And we will not falter  
Yeah, we can share de dreams
