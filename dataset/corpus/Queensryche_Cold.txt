There's gotta be more than this  
'Cause what you're sayin' don't make sense  
The fire in your eyes  
Has gone out again  
  
And the only thing I want  
In the middle of disarray  
Are words that can make you stay  
Something that shakes you  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
We've been at this too long  
I don't know what went wrong  
Would you stay here  
If I begged you to  
Is there something I can do  
You're so cold  
  
It's not a game that can be won  
It's not a fight that's ever done  
When it cuts you deep within  
You want you want it more  
  
At that moment  
When you're broken  
And you struggle and sacrifice  
Suddenly you feel it  
That's when you know  
That's when you know  
This feels right  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
If I hadn't left you alone  
You'd be standing here  
Standing here  
Would you stay here  
If I begged you to  
Oh what more can I do  
You're so cold  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
If you walked right out the door  
I won't beg you anymore  
Would you stay here  
With me now  
There's no more room for doubt  
You're so damn cold  
  
You're so cold  
It's a good time to move along  
You want something more than this  
More than this  
Do you even know how  
You're so damn cold  
  
You're so cold  
You're so damn cold
