yeah  
  
eight days a week with my baby at home  
and you know that she's my tender honey  
  
baby I've been good  
but you know it's rough  
when you're spending all of my money  
  
ain't no disputin' I'm your man  
you know I want to tell the world  
  
you're the only woman  
show me what love can be  
you're the only woman  
that understands a man like me  
  
rock and roll is a way of life  
but don't you know it brings me down  
music is my game but when I'm home  
I treat a lady like she's wearing a crown  
  
stranded in the storm 'round Lakewood Way  
you know who comes to mind  
  
she's the only woman  
show me what love can be  
she's the only woman  
that understands a man like me  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
when I'm away with time to kill  
just sittin' around gettin' high  
thinking about your sweet sweet love  
I want to jump on a plane and fly  
  
sweet little susie  
show me what love can be  
she's the only woman  
that understands a man  
she understands a man  
(like me)  
  
she's the only woman  
she's the only woman  
she's the only woman
