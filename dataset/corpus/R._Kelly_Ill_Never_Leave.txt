Shut up,  
I don't never want to hear you say that again  
Baby I'm not going nowhere  
Look at me, you understand me?  
  
Now, what gave you the silly idea that I'm about to leave  
Girl who you been listening to? They must be crazy  
Look back and see our past and all the shit that we been through  
I'll be damned if I'm gon let this bullcrap take me away from you  
Cause I vow to give my all and girl I'm a man of my words  
And on that word, I'll stand tall  
Being without you sounds absurd  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Cause I'll be here by your side  
No need to doubt the sky  
I'm in this for the long ride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never leave, no  
You don't have to worry  
Girl I will be right there for you  
I will never leave, no  
Baby can't you see  
I was born to be with you  
I will never leave, no  
God put us together  
Nothing can take that away  
I will never leave you no  
Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days  
  
You never have to question the love I have for you  
Girl I will put my life on bended knees for you  
Ask all my friends, they'll tell you  
Your all I talk about  
Even when I go to sleep your the only one I dream about  
See I'm your picture girl and baby you are my frame  
And that's why I know our love will stay the same  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Girl I'm by your side  
Just trust me I'm that guy  
I'm in it for the long ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Since that the day the doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me  
Girl I was born to be with you and the rest is history  
Generations and now I'm all grown up and you carry my seed  
Now we are flesh and blood  
With you I am in love  
For the rest of my life  
For the rest of my life  
We've been blessed with a love that's rare  
That's why I'm not going nowhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was meant to be with you  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
