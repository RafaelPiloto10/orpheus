Three days of snow in a burnin' hell,  
Bet you're wonderin' where I am,  
Rang that number all night long,  
Got no comfort on the telephone,  
Went out and caught me a midnight flight,  
Thought a little love would make it all alright,  
But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay,  
Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon.  
He left me with a Keno card, livin' in Vegas ain't too hard,  
I ran it up to about 50 grand, counted it out and held it in my hand,  
That kinda word will get around, and make a lost love come up found,  
I hear ya knockin' baby at my door, but you don't live here no more,  
Oh no, I think he made his move too soon.  
Instrumental  
I've been from Spain to Tokyo, from Africa to Ohio,  
I never try to make the news, I'm just a man who sings those low down blues,  
I'll take my lovin everywhere, I come back to know they still care,  
One lover here, one love behind, one in my arms, one on my mind,  
One thing baby never make a move too soon  
Yeah baby, never make your move too soon,  
Well you can count on this baby, we never make a move too soon  
(Too soon)
