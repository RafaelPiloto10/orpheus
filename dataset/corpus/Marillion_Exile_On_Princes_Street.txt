I saw a blue umbrella in Princes Street Garden  
Heading out west for the Lothian Road  
An evening news stuffed deep in the pocket  
  
Little did I know that even a heavy load  
I found us walking Grierson's dockyards  
Where the only thing working was foreign film crews  
Making an impressive documentary  
  
For the big news  
To the satellite  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a sense of pride and identity  
  
The waters left behind we shouldn't forget  
Laid low in the books of history  
I saw the starlings wheel round Georgian spires  
Gathering on patrol in the skies  
  
In the distance burns the flame of Grangemouth  
And the dream is lost  
Everything what it could inspire  
From the take you know there is no distance  
  
How we talk about in the secret affairs  
Taking our ride into the distance  
To be what it was or could have been  
What I should have said  
  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
'Till we take some more steps to unity  
Take it back to me  
  
Take it back  
In a city run out of luck  
And all we're left with is the black, black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
  
Calling the ... for identity  
What it meant to me, what I said  
What we could have had  
I saw a blue umbrella in Princes Street Garden  
  
Heading out west for the Lothian Road  
An evening news stuck deep in the pocket  
Little did I know that he'd fall  
Carrying a heavy load  
  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
Calling a name in the sake of unity  
What it means to me you'll never know  
  
You'll never know  
I see myself forced in servant exile  
Turning around at another's command  
All I want to see is identity  
  
What I could have been  
What I did  
Could have been  
Internal exile  
  
Internal exile
