Long distance callin' in the middle of a rainy night  
So much static, hardly knew your voice  
An' you've been cryin', want me to love you like I did before  
Girl when it comes to you, you know I've got no choice  
  
You put a storm inside me, I want to head for a safer harbor  
They all tell me I should give you up, but no man coulda tried any harder  
Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin' me, just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a sailor to a siren, like a moth to a flame  
I know your love might be the death for me, but I run to you just the same  
Like a sailor to a siren, nothing's gonna keep us apart  
Crashin' over the wreckage of all the sailor's broken hearts  
  
Musta met you when we were livin' in another time  
Had nothin' but the jealous gods to point our way  
When men were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore  
Wailin' like a siren leadin' him astray  
  
I got another woman and I know you got another man  
They all tell me I should give you up, but I don't think that any mortal can  
Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin' to me, just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna abandon ship, steal you from the cliff  
Take you to a place where the gods can't find us no more  
Let the sailors listen to the sirens if they dare  
Gonna be dancin' on the water, drownin' in your yellow hair  
  
[Chorus: x2]
