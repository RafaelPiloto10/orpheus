Maybe your heart is aching  
I wouldn't know, now would I?  
Maybe your spirit's breaking up  
I shouldn't care, now should I?  
Maybe you're thinking of me  
Well I don't know, now do I?  
If you only knew how I feel  
Wish I could die, now don't I?  
  
I'm just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Just another high  
Couldn't believe in my eyes  
You drifted into my life  
But marriages made in heaven  
Can they survive in this life?  
Surely it came as no surprise  
Love was too hot to handle  
Well I really blew my cool and you  
You just blew out the candle  
Didn't you just try just another high?  
Didn't you sign as you waved goodbye?  
  
Just another high  
I'm just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Lately it seems so empty here  
But I suppose I'm alright  
Maybe tomorrow's not so clear  
Still I remember that night  
Singing to you like this is  
My only way to reach you  
Though I'm too proud to say it  
Oh how I long too see you  
Shattered by dreams, by your goodbye  
As shattered my goodbye, as filled the sky  
  
Desolate am I  
Just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Maybe I should start anew  
And maybe I should find someone who  
Will maybe love me like I love you  
Maybe I'm too stuck on you  
Maybe I got stuck on you
