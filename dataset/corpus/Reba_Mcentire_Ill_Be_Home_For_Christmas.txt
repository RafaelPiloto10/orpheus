I'm dreaming tonight of the place I love  
Even more then I usually do  
And although I know it's a long road back  
This I promise you  
  
Well, I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
So please have snow and lots of mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Oh Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love life is  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
You know Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love life is  
Darling I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
Oh if only in my dreams
