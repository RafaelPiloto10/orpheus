Oh baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Oh baby, my baby  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama needs some lovin'  
Baby, won't you please come on home?
