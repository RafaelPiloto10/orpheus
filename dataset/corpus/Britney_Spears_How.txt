How can you tell me its not real?  
How can you tell me you don't feel... Like I do.  
We can save this... This is love we don't want to miss.  
  
Some questions can't be answered but how?  
  
Chorus-  
How... How can you do these things to me  
How... I don't know how you can't see  
That you and I... Baby, are meant to be  
  
Sometimes I think... I can move on.  
But how can I do that when when my love is so strong.  
I need you baby, more than you know  
And I try to let these feelings show.  
  
Just tell me how... How can you do this?  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
How  
How can you do this to me  
How  
You said we were meant to be  
How  
I don't understand  
How  
We're not still holding hands  
  
It was a fairy tale while it lasted... And I don't know how but....  
Its over.
