I'm a fool to want you,  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true,  
A love that's there for others too  
I'm a fool to hold you,  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone,  
To share a kiss the devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
And then would come a time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
Take me back, I love you,  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong,  
It must be wrong  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along without you  
Hmmmm, I'm a fool to want you  
You hurt me time and time again  
But I still love you babe  
I'm a fool, I'm your fool
