At times I don't believe that I can't control my heart  
It skips a beat even before the Lovin' starts  
I seem to fall in love  
With just the slighest touch  
And even the little things  
Begin to mean so much  
And though I should hold out longer  
Just to make sure things get stronger  
Chorus:  
You tell me that you love me  
And before I'm sure you really do  
You say you love me more and more each day  
And that's when my sensitivity gets in the way  
It's hard for me to play those fancy games of love  
Just say the right thing baby and it's automatic love  
I try not to let you know  
How easily I go  
Off into lovers' land  
Just when you touch my hand  
And though I should wait to see  
How things are gonna really be  
Repeat Chorus
