When he first cried, his mother died.  
I had tried to be his guide  
When he was born I was too young  
The father searches for the son  
  
In Istanbul.  
Give him back to me  
In Istanbul.  
Give me back my brown eyed son.  
  
Moonlight jumping through the trees  
Sunken eyes avoiding me.  
From dawn to dusk the hunt is on  
The father searches for the son.  
  
In Istanbul  
Give him back to me  
In Istanbul  
Give me back my brown eyed son  
  
On secret streets in disbelief  
Little shadow shows the lead  
Prostitutes stylish and glum  
In amongst them you are one  
Oh what have I done...  
  
Rolling breathless off the tongue the vicious street gang slang  
I lean into a box of pine  
Identify the kid as mine
