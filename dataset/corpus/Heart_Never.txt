Hey baby I'm talking to you  
Stop yourself and listen  
Some things you can never choose  
Even if you try yeah  
You're bangin' your head again  
Cause somebody won't let you in  
One chance, one love  
Your chance to let me know  
  
We can't go on  
Just running away  
If we stay any longer  
We will surely never get away  
Anything you want, we can make it happen  
Stand up and turn around  
Never let them shoot us down  
Never, never  
Never, never run away  
  
Hey baby you know it's true  
Why you bother lying when you know  
That you want it too  
Don't you dare deny me  
Walk those legs right over here  
Give me what I'm dying for  
One chance, one love  
Hold me down never let me go  
  
We can't go on  
Just running away  
If we wait any longer  
We will surely never get away  
Anything you want, we can make it happen  
Stand up and turn around  
Never let them shoot us down  
Never, never  
Never, never run away  
Never, never  
Never, never run away  
  
Hey baby I'm talking to you  
Stop yourself and listen  
Some things you can never choose  
Even if you try yeah  
You're bangin' your head again  
Cause somebody won't let you in  
One chance, one love  
Your chance to let me know  
  
We can't go on  
Just running away  
If we stay any longer  
We will surely never get away  
  
Oh oh never  
Oh oh never  
  
We can't go on never  
We can't go on never  
  
Oh oh never  
Oh oh never  
  
We can't go on never  
We can't go on never
