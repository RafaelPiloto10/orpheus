Second Nature Lyrics  
Something tells me when something's wrong  
Seems like it's been such a long,  
Long time since I felt that one  
  
You have your ways and I have my ways  
And like the back of my hand I know it  
And I don't have to try to make you show it  
You don't have to show me how  
  
'Cause it's second nature to me now  
Something's taken hold of me somehow  
'Cause it's second nature to me now  
  
Nobody must explain to me your way of communication  
Give me the time to understand  
I always come around  
I have my ways and you have your ways  
  
And we need no elaboration  
We can just enjoy that sweet sensation
