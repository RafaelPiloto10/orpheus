Room 16, the palms motel  
Now I can rest behind that door  
My life with you's become a living hell  
Don't want to live like that no more  
And whatever it will take  
I will do to make this final break  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
So I'll unpack my bag  
And kick off these old shoes  
This room is a good as anyplace I've ever been  
For lookin' at the truth  
Now it's all so clear to me  
What a blind man could plainly see  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
Oh, god, here comes the tears  
I'm gonna stay right here  
I'll cry. I've cried before  
But I won't go back no more  
  
Looks like a change in the weather  
I can hear it start to rain  
I hope it's not too long this time  
Before the sun comes out again  
But if it rains forever  
I will still be better off  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life
