This is a song about a very big, strong, black, sexy southern baptist minister  
Who thinks he's got his program all together, until he meets a lady who lets
him know  
That he ain't got it all together, his name is reverend dr. lee  
Reverend lee, he went to the water, and he prayed to the lord  
About old satan's daughter, it seems in a dream, child, while he lay sleeping  
She climbed in his bed, starts rubbing and weeping, ah, she was twisting and
turning, hmm  
She was begging and pleading, loving and burning, panting, breathing, ooh, ah,
ah  
Reverend lee, she said, lord knows that I love you child, but I would not
even, no, no,  
Place God above you, well reverend lee, he lifted his arms high  
Said heavenly father, take me home to the sky, he said lord please don't test
me  
Not down where she touched me, my mind is so hazy  
And you know my body is hungry, oh yeah, and then God rolled the thunder  
And he hurled the lightening uh, oh, he seemed to be angry  
Well it really was frightening, yes he was, oh the thunder grew louder  
Darkened conditions, and just then a voice said, God cannot be petitioned  
Just then the devil, oh he emerged from the water, and he said in that dry
voice  
Your God will not barter, reverend lee, he went screaming from the water  
And he was hotly pursued by old satan's daughter  
And she said, she said reverend, ooh, reverend, reverend lee  
She said reverend lee, do it to me, she said, she said, uh, reverend lee  
(reverend, reverend, reverend, reverend lee), I don't want nobody else to do
it  
Do it but you, do it, do it, yeah you, do it, do it to me
