I don't share,  
I'm not that type  
Your list and you,  
Can walk on by  
One of many,  
Not worth my while  
My one and only,  
Now that's my style  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
I'm a priceless find  
I'm supposed to be on a pedestal,  
Not standing in line  
Oh no no no  
So make a choice,  
Must decide  
It's them tonight,  
Or me for life  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
Hey (x16)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
  
Or I don't come at all...
