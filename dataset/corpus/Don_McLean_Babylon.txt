By the waters, the waters of Babylon  
We lay down and wept, and wept, for thee Zion  
We remember thee, remember thee, remember thee Zion  
By the waters, the waters of Babylon  
We lay down and wept, and wept, for thee Zion  
We remember thee, remember thee, remember thee Zion  
By the waters, the waters of Babylon  
We lay down and wept, and wept, for thee Zion  
We remember thee, remember thee, remember thee Zion
