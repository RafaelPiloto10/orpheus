Didn't know what to get you  
Ordinary just wouldn't do  
But I just found the perfect gift for you  
  
I hear church bells a ringing  
Careless singing harmony with me now  
You are looking so lovely  
Oohh Even if the lights go out  
  
We've got mistletoe and fire light  
On this cold December night  
The snow outside will said the moon  
As I sing my song  
  
We've got mistletoe and fire light  
On this cold December night  
The snow outside will said the moon  
As I sing my song for you  
Sing my song  
Sing my song for you
