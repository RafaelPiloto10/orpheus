Now if your mind lies in the Devil's workshop  
And evil-doin's your thrill  
And trouble and mischief is all you live for  
You know darn well  
That you'll go to Hell  
  
So you're living high and mighty  
Rich off the fat of the land  
Just don't dispose of your natural soul  
'Cause you know darn well  
That you'll go to Hell  
  
I say Hell  
Where your natural soul burns  
Hell  
Where you pay for your sins  
Hell  
Keep your children from wrong-doing  
'Cause you know darn well  
That they'll go to Hell.  
  
I say Hell  
Man, woman were created  
Hell  
To live for eternity  
Hell  
With an apple they ate from the tree of hate  
So you know darn well  
That they went to Hell.  
  
Now Satan was an angel in Heaven  
But he stirred up trouble and woe  
So the Lord commanded that the Devil be branded  
So you know darn well  
He went to Hell  
Yeah, he went to Hell  
Yeah, he went to Hell  
He went to Hell.
