He was a boy  
Who felt like a man  
She was a girl  
From a far away land  
Far more beautiful  
Than the picture in his hand  
She had eyes  
That would draw him in  
They took a plane ride  
Together they would find  
Her long lost smile  
They went home again  
Back to her friends  
Back to repair her heart  
He loved this girl  
With all of his heart  
He wanted her mind  
Her secrets and her trust  
She would never do him any harm  
He'd give her the world  
If it sat in his palm  
One rainy day  
It was dark in the sky  
She turned and she said to him  
With grey in her eyes  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
His heart turned to liquid  
And it trickled from his eyes  
All he could do now  
At this point in his life  
Was to go home again  
Back to his friends  
Back to repair his heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart
