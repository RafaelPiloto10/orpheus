Looking in the mirror  
Must be harder than you thought  
Truth is not a pretty sight to see  
Cheatin' ain't worth cheatin' honey  
When you're gettin' caught  
Lovin' him while losin' you and me  
  
Maybe I was foolish  
Sometimes dreamers often are  
I believed that you believed in me  
Standing in love's quick sand honey  
Reaching for a star  
Looking for your love to set me free  
  
I've seen all the dreams  
I ever thought was coming true  
Shattered like a mirror in your hall  
Leaving your reflection like a four letter word  
Fading quickly from some bathroom wall  
  
Trying to understand love  
Is the hardest part of all  
Does it really matter whose to blame  
Once I called you honey  
Now I never call at all  
Knowing you could only call me names  
  
Seeing it was over  
Did not mean that you could go  
Leaving me the pleasure of the pain  
Trusting someone else will be  
A harder row to hoe  
Lovin' won't be easier again
