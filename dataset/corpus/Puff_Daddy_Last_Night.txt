Last night (last night)  
I couldn't even get an answer (answer)  
I tried to call (tried to call)  
but my pride wouldn't let me dial (dial, dial, dial)  
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (expression, expression,
expression)  
And the way I feel (way I feel)  
I wanna curl up like a child (child, child)  
  
I know you can hear me  
I know you can feel me  
I can't live without you  
God, please make me better  
I wish I wasn't the way I am  
  
If I told you once, I told you twice  
You can see it in my eyes  
I'm all cried out with nothing to say  
You're everything I wanted to be  
If you could only see your heart belongs to me  
I love you so much  
I'm yearning for your touch  
Come and set me free  
Forever yours I'll be  
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?  
  
Last night (oh last night)  
I couldn't even get an answer  
(Oh baby what you wanna do to me)  
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial  
(Why wouldn't you just tell me baby, oh)  
And I'm sitting here  
With this blank expression  
(Don't say it baby no no no)  
And the way I feel  
I wanna curl up like a child  
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely)  
  
Tell me what words to say  
To make you come back, and break me like that  
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home  
With you I'm never alone  
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone  
Whatever you do  
Just don't leave me  
  
Last night  
I couldn't even get an answer (couldn't get an answer baby)  
I tried to call (call me baby)  
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (oh couldn't you just tell me baby)  
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression (don't say that no)  
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely)  
  
I need you, and you need me  
This is so plain to see  
And I will never let you go  
And I will always love you so, I will  
If you could only see  
Your heart belongs to me  
I love you so much  
I'm yearning for your touch  
Come and set me free  
Forever yours I'll be  
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?  
  
Last night  
I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't answer baby yeah)  
I tried to call (call me baby)  
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (oh couldn't you just tell me baby)  
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression (don't say that no)  
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely)  
  
Why don't you pick up the phone  
And dial up my number  
And call me up, baby?  
I'm waiting on you
