You're breakin' my heart  
Stealing my thunder  
How much more can i take  
You're draggin' me down  
Holding me under  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
Won't somebody break  
The news to you gently.  
You fill my eyes  
But you don't fill the hunger  
How much more can i take  
  
I see your face  
Everywhere, everyplace  
How much more can i take  
You're here in the night  
You're here in the morning sunlight  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
I (wish that i could) make your mind up (for you).  
You fill my eyes  
But you don't fill the hunger  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
Won't somebody help me  
I'm naked as the day i was born  
These clothes have a way  
Of changin' what i'm feelin'  
I try and i try but i can't put 'em on  
  
I sit here alone  
Wait by the telephone line  
How much more can i take  
I'm jealous as hell  
Mixed up 'n mean as well  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
I know she'd like to break  
Those stones over my body.  
You fill my eyes  
But you don't fill the hunger  
How much more can i take
