A moving stream of information  
That is floating on the wind  
The secrets never end  
And now they call,  
They sing, they play, they dance  
For you, from out of the blue,  
What can you do?  
  
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly  
They call to me across the air  
The messages across the atmosphere  
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere  
  
Where words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky  
Then I'll be there, I'll be there  
When messages will call to you their secrets all around  
Without a sound, they're all around  
  
Those secret messages that spill into the air from far away  
So far away  
A flowing river of illusion running with confusion  
Never gone - it goes on and on  
  
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly  
They call to me across the air  
The messages across the atmosphere  
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere
