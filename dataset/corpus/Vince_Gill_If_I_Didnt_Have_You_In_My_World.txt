If I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave  
  
It seems like I've waited a lifetime  
To find someone special like you  
If you ever walked out of my life  
I don't know what I would do  
  
'Cause if I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave  
  
You gave me a reason for livin'  
The first time I looked in your eyes  
I shudder to think what might happen  
If you ever told me goodbye  
  
'Cause if I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave
