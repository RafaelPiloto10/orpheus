Eleanor's Castle, boy, what a hassle  
Why did you have to build yorr walls so high?  
I'd put my arm around you, but a moat surrounds you  
The only way's to let your drawbridge down  
  
Nights without number, I'm without slumber  
Thinking of ways to breach your turrets tall  
You're an iron lady and someday maybe  
You'll forget to bar the iron door  
  
Man was made to conquer, so the story goes  
I wish I knew who said it he could help me 'cause he knows  
This situation's gettin' way out of line  
I can't win if you won't let me in  
Ain't it a sin? (it's a sin she won't let him in)  
  
Break  
  
Shielded from my advances, there's very few chances  
I'm a one man crusade fightin' in vain  
Rack my brains for ideas but it appears  
Compared to you dragons are easily slain
