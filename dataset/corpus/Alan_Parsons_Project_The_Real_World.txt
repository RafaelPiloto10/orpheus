Lead vocal - john miles  
  
One more compromise I won't be making  
One more easy way out I won't be taking  
So many chances don't come twice  
So many eyes are made of ice  
One more cheating hand I won't be shaking  
  
One more substitute I won't be trying  
One more piece of the rock that I'm not buying  
So many times we stand and fight  
So many reasons can't be right  
One more simple truth I'm not denying  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many fools who don't think twice  
Too many ways to pay the price  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
One more sacrifice I won't be making  
One more golden rule I won't be breaking  
No one to let me state my case  
No one to tell me to my face  
One more sweet suprise I won't be faking  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many bridges you can burn  
Too many tables you can't turn  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many games that I can't play  
Too many windmills in my way  
Don't wanna live in the real world
