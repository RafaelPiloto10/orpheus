Anna I  
  
Now we're coming back to you, in Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is a-shining ever.  
Seven years we've been away in the big towns  
Where you go to make money,  
And now our fortune's made,  
And now you're there,  
Little house in old Louisiana.  
We're coming back to you,  
To our little house beside the Mississippi in Louisiana  
Right, Anna ?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.
