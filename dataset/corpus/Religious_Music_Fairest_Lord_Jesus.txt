Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature  
O Thou of God and man the Son  
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor  
Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown.  
  
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands  
Robed in the blooming garb of spring  
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer  
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.  
  
Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight  
And fair the twinkling starry host  
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer  
Then all the angels heav'n can boast.  
  
All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly  
Wondrously Jesus is found in Thee  
None can be nearer, fairer or dearer  
Than Thou my Savior art to me...
