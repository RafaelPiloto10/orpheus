Take me to your world of wonder  
Let me come inside your room  
Invisible  
Now you see nothin'  
Some investigation as to the state of us  
No misunderstanding girl  
On either side  
  
I couldn't lie if I try any other way  
I can't stop thinking of that girl of mine  
I'm for the rise and the fall  
Any other way and  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
You shouldn't do it, you shouldn't do it  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Who can stop your past from rushing by  
Born to live one million stories high  
Into the night  
Into the day  
  
Take me to a town or country  
Stranger in a strange land  
And I'm an alien  
No you can't find me  
You be there at the station  
When the train arrives  
When it leaves I get my hands on you  
  
I fool myself if I turn any other way  
I still keep searchin' for that girl of mine  
I'm for the hell of it all  
  
Do it anyway and  
  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Hearts can break and hearts can  
Turn the tide  
All is love and love is open wide  
Ghost train  
Ghost train  
Into the night  
Into the day
