I stop and think for just a while  
Wondering if He'd see me  
Would He think that I'm worthwhile?  
'Cause now I feel so far away  
But I believe, yes I believe  
  
His eyes I know they watch me close  
My every move He knows before it's even done  
And even though I may be wrong  
He changes me and cleanses me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I know how much I've hurt You so  
By doing things I know would go against Your heart  
But now I've come to see myself  
With You in me so patiently  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I have never left you on your own, My Precious One  
Hold on, the time is near I'm coming soon  
To take You home with Me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me [lead me] oh lead me [lead me] lead me
there...  
  
[Oh God search and know]  
Search and know
