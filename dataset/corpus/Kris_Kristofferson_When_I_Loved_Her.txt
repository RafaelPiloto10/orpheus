Well, she didn't look as pretty as some others I have known  
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone  
But she had a way of making me believe that I belonged  
And it felt like coming home, when I found her  
  
She seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands  
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man  
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms  
And it left me feelin' warm, when I loved her.  
  
Chorus:  
'cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun  
And she made what I was doin' seem worth while  
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever known  
And it made me want to smile, when I loved her.  
  
I know some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the winds  
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends  
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again  
And I'll never understand why I lost her  
  
[Chorus:]  
'cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun  
And she made what I was doin' seem worth while  
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever known  
And it made me want to smile, when I loved her.
