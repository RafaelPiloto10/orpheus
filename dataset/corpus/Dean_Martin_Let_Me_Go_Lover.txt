Oh let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go lover  
  
Let me be, set me free from your spell  
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
You don't want me  
  
But you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we are through  
Please turn me loose  
What's the use  
  
Let me go lover  
Let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go  
  
You don't want me  
But you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we are through  
Please turn me loose  
What's the use  
  
Let me go lover  
Let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go
