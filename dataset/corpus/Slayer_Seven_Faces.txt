I saw them all around today  
They don't stop they won't go away  
They love the darkness in my eyes  
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself  
  
They show me everything I need  
There's nothing wrong with a little greed  
Never enough to satisfy  
Such a driving desire that burns inside  
  
My life came with it's own scars  
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow  
I can't say I've seen it all  
But I live for the things that keep me hollow  
  
Everyday I look into the mirror  
Staring back I look less familiar  
I've seen all seven faces  
Each one looks a lot like me  
  
They all look like me  
I never see them coming  
But they show me more of myself  
Drawn into the depths  
I never knew existed  
Launching me face first  
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed  
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess  
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of  
Everything  
  
My Life came with it's own scars
