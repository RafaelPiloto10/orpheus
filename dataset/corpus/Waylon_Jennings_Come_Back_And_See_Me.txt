Today was supposed to be  
Just another day  
Before the meeting of our minds and  
What you had to say  
It's been a long time comin' and  
I guess i never saw  
I'll have a short time adjusting to it all  
  
You have come to your conclusion  
You no longer care for me  
And that we don't belong together  
I suppose we should agree  
There is nothing i can do  
Now that you've made up your mind  
But could you come back and see me sometime  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there any way that you could leave a little at a time  
I need the time to make adjustments of the heart and of the mind  
It might be that you'll remember some old feeling left behind  
And if you do would you come back and see me sometime  
  
I am left with no defenses  
For i have no control  
And for the first time in my man wood  
I'll do what i am told  
It's all over but the leaving you're  
Determined now to do  
I'll have the burden of gettin' over you  
  
There's no need to be suspicious i have  
Nothing left to hide  
It's all out in the open i have  
Nothing left inside  
Just seeing you would be enough  
It's all i have in mind  
So could you come back see me sometime  
  
[Chorus]
