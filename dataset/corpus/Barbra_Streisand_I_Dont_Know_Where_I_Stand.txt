Funny day  
Looking for laughter  
And finding it there  
  
Sunny day  
Braiding wild flowers  
And leaves in her hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote  
"I love you"  
  
In my finest hand  
I wanted to send it  
But I don't know where I stand  
  
Telephone  
Even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California  
  
I'm talking to you  
I'm feeling too foolish and strange  
To say the words that I had planned  
I guess it's too early  
  
'Cause I don't know where I stand  
Crickets call courting the ladies  
In starred apple green thickets tall  
  
Until the morning  
Comes up like a dream  
How muted and misty  
Such rouse and I'll take  
What sleep I can  
I know that I miss you  
But I don't know where I stand  
I know that I miss you  
But I don't know where I stand
