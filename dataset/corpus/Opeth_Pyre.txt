Follow the embers into cities of dreams  
What you'll be seeing is not all what it seems  
Dawn of the liar  
Future's a pyre  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry  
  
Look down your senses  
Await the gritting beyond  
And in the morning...  
  
Born as a failure  
And died as a stranger  
  
When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry  
  
"Bring me back again"
