Yeah, oh yeah!  
Ooh, said I,  
I'm coming out to get you  
Ooh, sit down  
I'm coming out to find you  
Ooh, yeah. Ooh yeah  
Finding my way!  
  
I've been gone so long  
I've lost count of the years  
Well, I sang some sad songs,  
Oh yes, and cried some bad tears  
  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, whoa  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, yeah  
  
I'm running,  
Finding my way back home  
Oh yeah!  
  
Yeah, oh yeah!  
Ooh, said I,  
I'm coming back to look for you  
Ooh, sit down  
I'm going by the back door  
Ooh, yeah. Ooh yeah  
Finding my way!  
  
You've done me no right,  
But you've done me some wrong  
Left me lonely each night  
While I sing my sad song  
  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, whoa  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, yeah  
  
I'm running,  
Finding my way back home  
I'm coming  
Ooh, babe, I said I'm running  
Whoa, babe, I said I'm coming  
To get you, mama  
Said I'm running  
  
Ooh, babe, I said I'm coming  
For you, babe  
I said I'm running  
Ooh yes, babe, I said I'm coming  
To get you, babe. I said I'm coming  
Ooh, yeah  
  
I'm finding,  
I'm finding my way back home  
Well, I've had it for now,  
Living on the road  
Ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah  
  
Finding my way!
