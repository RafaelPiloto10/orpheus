Moon of gold in the sky.  
My loving sweetheart said goodbye.  
Those moonlight kisses that she shared with me,  
Are just a memory.  
  
By the light of your glow.  
Those tender love words whispered low,  
Were just a promise that never came true,  
For she found someone new.  
  
How, how was I to know she'd soon go,  
And leave me longing in the moon glow?  
  
Since she's gone I'm alone,  
I have no sweetheart of my own.  
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,  
And a tarnished moon of gold.  
  
Since she's gone I'm alone,  
I have no sweetheart of my own.  
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,  
And a tarnished moon of gold.
