All I wish, that I wasn't here  
Don't you know, I've got a rotten feeling  
Of dizzy heights  
Its what they want you know  
Oh well here I go  
  
What a funny show  
  
Take my time, it's the odds that count  
Who am I? What a silly sound  
Hold my breath, talk of sudden death  
Rhyme and reason must prevail  
I need a glass of ale  
  
I've gotta feeling now  
No need for me to tell you how  
It's really kind of easy now  
Woa, like rock n' roll  
  
It's gonna be alright  
It's funky and it's outta sight  
Feeling good, feeling right  
It's gonna be alright
