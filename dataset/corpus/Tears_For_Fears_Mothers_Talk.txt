My features form with a change in the weather  
Weekend  
We can work it out  
My features form with a change in the weather  
Weekend  
We can work it out  
When the wind blows  
When the mothers talk  
When the wind blows  
When the wind blows  
When the mothers talk  
When the wind blows  
We can work it out  
It's not that you're not good enough  
It's just that we can make you better  
Given that you pay the price  
We can keep you young and tender  
Following in the footsteps of a funeral pyre  
You were paid not listen now your house is on fire  
Wake me up when things get started  
When everything starts to happen  
My features form with a change in the weather  
Some of us horrified  
Others never talk about it  
But when the weather starts to burn  
Then you'll know that you're in trouble  
Following in the footsteps of a soldier girl  
It is time to put your clothes on and to face the world  
Don't you feel your luck is changing  
When everything starts to happen  
Put your head right next to my heart  
The beat of the drum is the fear of the dark  
My features form with a change in the weather
