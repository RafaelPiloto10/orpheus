Grass in your hair stretched like a lion in the sun  
Restlessly turned moistened your mouth with your tongue.  
Pouring my wine in your eyes caged mine glowing  
Touching your face my fingers strayed knowing.  
I called you lady of the dancing water.  
  
Blown autumn leaves shed to the fire where you laid me  
Burn slow to ash just as my days now seem to be.  
I feel you still always your eyes glowing  
Remembered hours salt, earth and flowers flowing  
Farewell my lady of the dancing water.
