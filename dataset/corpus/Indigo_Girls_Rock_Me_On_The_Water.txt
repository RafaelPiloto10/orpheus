Oh people  
Look around you  
The signs are everywhere  
Youve left it for somebody other than you  
To be the one to care  
Youre lost inside your houses  
And theres no time to find you now  
Well your walls are turning  
Your towers are burning  
Gonna leave you here  
And try to get down to the sea somehow  
  
The road is filled with homeless souls  
Every woman child and man  
Who have no idea where they will go  
But theyll help you if they can  
But everyone must have some thought  
That's gonna pull them through somehow  
While the fires are raging hotter and hotter  
The sisters of the sun are gonna  
Rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow  
  
Oh people  
Look among you  
Its there your hope must lie  
Theres a seabird above you  
Gliding in one place  
Like jesus in the sky  
We all must do the best we can  
And then hang on the that gospel plow  
When my life is over  
Gonna stand before the father  
And the sisters of the sun are gonna  
Rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Maybe Ill remember  
Maybe Ill remember how  
  
Rock me on the water  
I said the wind is with me now  
So rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow
