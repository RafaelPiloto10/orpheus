Well, the sun's not so hot  
In the sky today  
And you know I can see  
Summertime slipping on away.  
  
A few more geese are gone,  
A few more leaves turning red,  
But the grass is as soft  
As a feather in a featherbed.  
  
So I'll be king and you'll be queen,  
Our kingdom's gonna be  
This little patch of green.  
Won't you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Oh, the memory is like  
The sweetest pain.  
Yeah, I kissed the girl  
At a football game.  
  
I can still smell the sweat  
And the grass stains.  
We walked home together,  
I was never the same.  
  
But that was a long time ago,  
And where is she now?  
I don't know.  
Won't you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Oh, September grass  
Is the sweetest kind,  
It goes down easy  
Like apple wine.  
  
Hope you don't mind  
If I pour you some,  
Made that much sweeter  
By the winter to come.  
  
Do you see those ants  
Dancing on a blade of grass?  
Do you know what I know?  
That's you and me, baby.  
  
We're so small  
And the world's so vast,  
We found each other  
Down in the grass.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass...
