Mister Santa  
Bring me some toys  
Bring merry Christmas  
To all girls and boys  
And every night  
I'll go to sleep singing  
And dream about  
The presents you'll be bringing  
Santa  
Promise me please  
Give every reindeer  
A hug and a squeeze  
I'll be good  
As good can be  
Mister Santa  
Don't forget me  
  
Mister Santa  
Dear old saint nick  
Be awful careful  
And please don't get sick  
Put on your coat  
When breezes are blowin'  
And when you cross the street  
Look where you're goin'  
Santa  
We've been so good  
We've washed the dishes  
And done what we should  
Made up the beds  
Scrubbed up our toesies  
We've used a Kleenex  
When we've blown our noseies  
Oh Santa  
Look at our ears  
They're clean as whistles  
We're sharper then shears  
Now we've put you on the spot  
Mister Santa  
Bring us a lot
