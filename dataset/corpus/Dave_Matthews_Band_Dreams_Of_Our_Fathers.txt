Oh, I'm choking, I'm choking  
On the smoke from this burning house  
I claw and I scrape  
But I can't seem to get out  
But who then, who is this  
That's scratching from the ground  
Oh, it's my world too  
But who's gold is this I'm digging out?  
  
Where we go, when we go  
When we're dead  
Is the verdict still out?  
Do we get into line  
To line up with those long dead now?  
With the muffled tears of sorrow  
Bones underground  
Is this time our time?  
Yes, it is  
Without of with this shadow of doubt.  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers.  
Oh, it's such a waste, child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers.  
  
I want to go, I want to run  
We turn, so sure someone's looking down  
It's haunting me, haunting me  
Leaves us here to get out  
Though I don't believe, I don't believe  
This flavor in my mouth  
Is from my tongue alone  
So bitter, I want to spit it out.  
  
I repeat these words  
They come out  
Under the blue light in the sky  
My empty pages are filling up  
With these wicked lies  
But I hear deep in myself  
An echo, an echo  
Of empty, empty emptiness  
Comes up and swells inside.  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers  
Oh, its such a waste, child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers  
  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on me  
And then give me air  
Rain on my love  
Again and again  
Why can't I dream you away from me?  
  
Look here, look here  
Bloated, floating  
Go belly down  
Belly up in the water  
But who is this here that's drowned?  
We followed a drunken man  
He got us all spinning round  
But it's like he swallowed himself  
And didn't leave us a way out  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers  
Oh, it's such a shame, child  
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the love of our fathers  
  
The dreams  
The dreams  
The dreams  
This love I possess love
