[Chorus]  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
  
I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver  
Should have brought my phantom na, but I'm mad at my driver  
He so fuckin' turnt up, ridin' on auto pilot smokin' kush and smilin',  
He drinkin' while he drivin'  
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em  
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own  
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone  
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone  
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light  
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight  
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice  
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop  
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok  
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots  
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot  
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked  
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock  
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know  
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe  
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle  
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder  
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters  
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds  
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'  
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'  
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion  
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday  
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'  
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions  
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky  
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits  
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged  
My charm big as a midget  
I give yo ass the business  
So if you got yo swag right you know that you can get it
