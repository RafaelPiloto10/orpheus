Hey yo!  
Let me be front  
This is real and not a stunt  
I'm comin' to the forefront  
Shovel for the rapper and clear the lane  
'Cause this jam is like a Tomahawk chop  
Teach ya I'll never stop droppin' topics  
Vocal power?  
Yes I got it  
  
On central but their trying to clamp it down  
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it... Down!  
Get down, and at the same time...  
Come up... Down!  
This is a crime that shut us up  
I don't give a fuck  
'Cause the words and the thoughts still hit  
And like I said  
It's not a skit  
Jump another hit  
Yeah  
Ya know I don't need a drum kit  
Make 'em say aw shit!  
The rebellion is true and legit  
  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane  
Down! Get down!... And clear the land  
Down! Get down!... Yeah!  
  
The rebel  
You'll never disable  
Defiance  
With the cards upon the table  
Pulling cards  
Keep the governements in check  
Yo!  
I think we need a new deck  
Never could trust a phillabusta'  
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya  
With words cold hittin' with the underground  
And now you're checkin' out the new sound  
Live hit  
A live pop  
Live rock  
And ya don't stop  
It goes on and on and on  
Who's a threat?  
C'mon, the war is on!  
  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane [Repeat x 4]  
  
Start droppin'  
Our words are never safe  
Fighting myself  
'Til I'm where I gotta be  
I challenge, don't sweat it  
Now don't you forget it  
Check me? What? Wait  
You better slow down!  
Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat  
I need cash so when I'm cool I'm never ever weak  
Places are fluid and diluted and complete  
Check me once, calm down and take a seat  
Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!  
  
Ugh... Clear the lane [Repeat x 4]  
  
Defiance  
Rippin' up the south set  
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat  
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in  
Timmy see  
Bring that bass in!  
  
Ugh... Clear the lane [Repeat x 4]
