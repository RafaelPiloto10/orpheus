[Verse 1]  
I've battled demons that won't let me sleep  
Called to the sea but she abandoned me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no  
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
And I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh yeah, I'm haunted by the distant past  
Called to the skies but she was she overcast  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no  
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
And I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Bridge]  
Never give up, never give up  
Never give up, never give up  
No, no, oooh  
  
[Chorus]  
And I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
I won't let you get me down  
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground  
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh  
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
