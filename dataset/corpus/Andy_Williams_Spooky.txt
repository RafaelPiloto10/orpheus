In the cool of the evening when everything is getting kinda' groovy  
I call you up and ask "would you like to go and meet to see a movie?"  
First you say no, you've got some plans for tonight  
And then you stop, and say "alright"  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
  
(Spooky)  
You always keep me guessin' and I never seem to know what you are thinking  
And if a fella looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be  
A-winkin'  
I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand  
And then you smile, and hold my hand  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
(Spooky)  
  
Let's dance...  
  
If you decide to stop this little game that you are playing  
I'm gonna tell you all that my heart has been dying to be sayin'  
Just like a ghost you've been hauntin' my dreams  
So I confess, on Halloweens  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
(Spooky)
