Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her oh no  
  
I'll write a song I've thought about it for far too long  
But I've never had someone to sing about until I met her  
Each day gets better  
  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody understands me like she  
Now that I know what true love means, I just hope she stays with me  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her  
  
She wants to breathe,  
She wants to be where the grass is green  
She wants to know how love's supposed to be  
She wants it better,  
I want to let her know she belongs right here with me  
She's heard it all but I'll make her see  
I'll make her fall, make her believe  
I'll promise her that I'll never leave  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her  
  
I just had to write a song about her  
Tell her I don't wanna live without her  
Tell her I would build my world around her  
Deeper and deeper, sweeter and sweeter  
I'll never leave her alone  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her, no
