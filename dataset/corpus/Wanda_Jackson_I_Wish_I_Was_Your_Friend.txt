I wish I was your friend and not your wife  
You're with your friends each night while home alone my teardrops fall  
You're having such a good time you don't take time to call  
I seldom see you anymore it's such a lonely life  
I wish I was your friend and not your wife  
I wish I was your friend how happy I could be  
To have you call me every night and want to be with me  
You'd always take me with you I could share your other life  
I wish I was your friend and not your wife  
[ steel - guitar ]  
The children hardly know you they just see you now and then  
They call you Mr Daddy when you come walkin' in  
To think you'd rather be with friends cuts us like a knife  
I wish I was your friend and not your wife I wish I was your friend and not
your wife
