Out where the bright lights are glowing  
You're drawn like a moth to a flame  
You laugh while the wine's overflowing  
While I sit and whisper your name  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting  
But my walls have nothing to say  
I'm made for love not for hating  
So here where you left I stay  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
One night with you is like heaven  
And so while I'm walking the floor  
I listen for steps in the hallway  
And wait for your knock on my door  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me
