It took three million years Now its my turn to see it  
Ive got to go back I just don't believe it Do you love it?  
Oh I bet you do Do you need it?  
Well, I'm just like you Smiley bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay of its back on the bottom of the bottle  
It took three million years to meet Mr. Helpful  
But now that I've meet him I'm extremely doubtful  
  
Are you healthy? Well I just eat fruit  
But I tell you man It just don't suit  
You're the bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and talking pure twaddle  
Its my turn now and there's always a houseful  
And saying the right thing Its always a mouthful  
It took three million years to meet Mr. Moonlight  
To finally ask him To put everything right  
  
You're the big bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and your talking pure twaddle  
To make you more smiley You drink olive oil  
It gives me pure headache When your cooking with foil  
Its my turn now And there's always a houseful  
And saying the right thing its always a mouthful
