Darling you were looking good  
When you came to me  
And asked for a dance  
And I said "we can dance"  
  
Felt like a queen  
Swedish summer nights are hot  
And the trees can talk  
We lay on the grass  
  
So easily, so blessed  
Whispers in blindness  
And I didn't hold you back  
I'm talking about it babe  
  
'Cause you've been teasing me  
I'm talking about it  
'Cause you are bad right through  
Stay with me and I shall want  
  
No other love  
Stay with me another love another lie  
Stay with me and I shall want  
No other love  
  
You were talking so sweet  
But you were touching  
And teasing  
I can hear the soft bells ring  
  
Through a thousand years  
They call out to me  
They say it's only once in a life we love  
Now I've had the honor too  
  
You were holding my hand  
You were kissing my skin  
Stay with me  
Trees are whispering  
Only once my dear
