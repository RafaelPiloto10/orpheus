Got a crazy feeling I don't understand  
'Gotta get away from here  
Feelin' like I shoulda kept my feet on the ground  
Waitin' for the sun to appear  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' that I enjoy  
  
'Cause you can't see what my eyes see  
(I can see it, I can see it)  
And you can't be inside of me, flying high again  
  
I can see through mountains watch me disappear  
I can even touch the sky  
Swallowing colors of the sound I hear  
Am I just a crazy guy (You bet)  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' that I enjoy  
  
If you could be inside my head  
You'd see that black and white is read  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand  
Never saw inside my head  
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand  
Never heard a thing I said  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I've been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' I enjoy  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again
