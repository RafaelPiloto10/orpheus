Hey little darling  
Theres something that you should know  
This things gonna hound every soul  
This thing they wont let us go  
Gonna break us down to nothing  
Gonna eat us from the inside out  
Hey little darling  
I dont want you to feeling the fallout  
  
Ah when the cancer finally took him  
I was watching the trucks pull in  
Me and your daddy we had a job  
Under the ground mining uranium  
Some things your daddy leaves you  
Some things he dont  
Some things are gonna be here anyhow  
And some things just wont  
One thing I want you to understand  
Is you aint gotta be no mining man  
I curse the day that I went down  
And I pulled that shit out of the ground  
  
Now we were living over in nevada  
Thats where your people come from  
Your grandma would take me and your daddy  
On down to the gunnery range  
We sit and watch the bombs blow  
Until the sun goes down  
All those colors running like the painted desert  
And you get to see it now  
  
Them government boys have something so damn secret  
They had to hide it in the desert sand  
Out there the skies so big  
And there aint no mistaking it  
Whose got the winning hand  
  
Ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
I said Ive been all the way to alaska  
To a town they call point of hope  
Where they took some of what we got down here  
Just to see how it would grow  
I hear the lichen bought it  
And now its running through the caribou  
I said soon little darling  
Youll get to feel it too  
Get to feel it too  
Oh I said soon little darling  
Youll get to feel it to  
Hmm hmm hmm yeah  
Oh yeah hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm hmm  
Oh yeah hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm hmm
