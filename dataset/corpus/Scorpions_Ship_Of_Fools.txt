Another bloody Monday  
Thirty-nine just died  
All hell breaks loose in the crowd  
A hopeless helter skelter  
Another mindless crime  
Some corner of the world is burning down  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like  
A thousand nights before  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed  
  
Corrupt politicians  
Promise paradise  
The thieves are reaching out for the crown  
Violence is a killer  
Threatens all our lives  
Judgment day has come here and now  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like  
A thousand nights before  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like  
A thousand nights before  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed
