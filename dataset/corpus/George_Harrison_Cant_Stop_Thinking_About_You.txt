Can't stop thinking about you  
Can't stop thinking about you  
Its no good living without you  
I can't stop thinking about you  
  
Can't stop thinking about you  
Can't stop thinking about you  
And it's no good living without you  
I can't stop thinking about you  
  
When the night-time comes around  
Daylight has left me, I  
I can't take it if I don't see you no more  
I can't help it, I need your loving so much more  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
Can't stop thinking about you  
And it's no good living without you  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about you, ooh  
  
Can't stop thinking about  
Can't stop thinking about  
Can't stop thinking about you  
  
When the morning comes around  
And the daylight gets to me, I  
I can't take it if I don't see you no more  
I can't help it, I need your loving so much more  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you, oh yeah  
I can't stop thinking about you  
And it's no good living without you  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about you  
  
I can't stop thinking about  
Can't stop thinking about  
Can't stop thinking about you  
  
(repeat and fade:)  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about  
I can't stop thinking about you
