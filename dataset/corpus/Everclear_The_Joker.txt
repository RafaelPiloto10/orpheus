Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me maurice  
'cause I speak of the pompitous of love  
  
People keep talking about me, baby  
Said I'm doin' you wrong  
Well, don't worry, don't worry  
'cause I'm right here at home  
  
  
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I sure don't want to hurt no one  
  
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see  
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree  
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time  
Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time  
  
Chorus 2x
