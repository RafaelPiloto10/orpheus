Let's take a rocket ship to space  
I hear it's a real swinging place  
There isn't much air, or gravity there  
The stars will make your heart race  
  
Let's take a rocket  
Let's take a rocket  
Let's take a rocket ship to space  
  
Let's take a saucer to the stars  
Look out moon, move over Mars  
The Martians all rock  
To Bassie and Bach  
So bring your maracas and your jazz guitars  
Let's take a saucer to the stars  
  
(Instrumental interlude)  
  
Let's take a rocket  
A crazy kind of rocket  
Let's take a rocket ship to space.  
Voiceover: It's the final frontier, baby.
