Jack talking, this is Jack talking  
He said I'm coming to London  
I'm sick and tired of the sun  
He said I'm coming to London  
I'm gonna have some fun  
I says Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
He said Phew I nearly got married  
To a bride in black  
You know she was always so angry  
She's always ready to attack  
That was Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Repeat  
I'm gonna tell him what to do  
Because he's such a fool he's always looking for the easy way out  
There's only love and hate time and fate  
The rest is the rest is the rest is...  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
He said I'm finished with acting  
Makes you feel like Jesus or John Wayne (Yeah!)  
So I'm coming to London (Yeah!)  
I'm gonna hang out in the rain (hang out in the rain)  
Ah it's Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
And I love him  
Instrumental... He's divine  
What's he gonna say Jack swing it  
I'm goona tell him what to do  
Because he's such a fool he's always looking for the easy way out  
There's only love and hate time and fate  
The rest is the rest is the rest is...  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
We better listen to that man (repeat chorus thoughout)  
Because he knows things well we don't understand  
He's got the world listening
