She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river  
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun  
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her  
And left me to die like a fox on the run  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run  
You know everybody knows she is a reason for my fall  
Woman tempted man down in paradise's hall  
That woman tempted me, Lord she took me for a ride  
And like the lonely fox I need a place to hide  
She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river  
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun  
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her  
And left me to die like a fox on the run  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run  
Oh Lord, come and take a glass of wine and fortify your soul  
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know  
I had a string of girls who have put me on before  
But the race nearly over, Lord the hounds are at my door  
She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river  
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun  
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her  
And left me to die like a fox on the run  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run
