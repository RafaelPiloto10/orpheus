There's never a day, that's passing my way  
That I never need it  
My hands on the wheel, my foot's on the steel  
'Cause I gotta feel it  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on  
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah  
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on  
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah  
  
It blows through my veins like thunder and rain  
And I can't live without it  
I scream for the crowds, and turn it up loud  
'Cause I gotta feel it  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Six string and lightning strikes  
Come make me blind  
Ooh burn it up  
Bring down the pedal to the metal  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Forever never stop
