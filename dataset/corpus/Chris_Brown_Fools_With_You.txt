White Flag Hangs Up, I Aint Got No Room For Them (No)  
If Love Was A Crime, I'd Be Doing Way More Then Life  
Girl I'm Through All I See Is You, Your My Heart Girl I Fools With You.  
  
(Chorus)  
Tell Me When, Tell Me Where,  
Whatever You Want Baby I'll Do It All For You  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
I'm In It And I don't Give A Damn  
All These Girls On My Head Like A Fresh Cut  
Try'na Get Yo Spot But They Gets No Love  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
Baby For The Things You Do I Fools With You  
  
(Second Verse)  
You Are what's Up, Baby I Aint Got No Reason To Lie  
Girl I'm Feelin Locked In But Not Stuck, But You Aint Never Always The Type  
Girl I'm Through All I See Is You  
Your My Heart Girl I Fools With You  
  
(Chorus)  
Tell Me When, Tell Me Where,  
Whatever You Want Baby I'll Do It All For You  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
I'm In It And I don't Give A Damn  
All These Girls On My Head Like A Fresh Cut  
Try'na Get Yo Spot But They Gets No Love  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
Baby For The Things You Do I Fools With You  
  
(Bridge)  
And If The Rain Falls Down, Try To Flood Us Out  
My Love Will Be Your Raft Girl  
Anything You Need, Promise I Will Be (Baby)  
You Can Count On Me, I'm Ready Right Now  
No Pressure On You  
The Only Kinda Fool I Wanna Be, Is The Kind That Fools With You  
  
(Chorus)  
Tell Me When, Tell Me Where,  
Whatever You Want Baby I'll Do It All For You  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
I'm In It And I don't Give A Damn  
All These Girls On My Head Like A Fresh Cut  
Try'na Get Yo Spot But They Gets No Love  
Kinda Love Got Me Sprung  
Baby For The Things You Do I Fools With You
