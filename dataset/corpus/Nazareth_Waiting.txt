Waitin' - got a leash around my neck  
Trainin' - I'll never be your pet  
Dyin', sighin'  
You got me flyin', cryin'  
  
I've been waitin' - standing by your side  
Prayin' - tryin' to turn the tide  
Spinnin', grinnin'  
You got me flyin' high  
  
Waitin' - I've been tryin' to state my case  
Racin' - Tryin' to keep it in the chase  
Slippin', slidin'  
I'm gonna be seekin', findin'  
  
You're strokin', I'm smokin'  
Your're playin' and I'm layin' a plan  
I'm getting' all the lovin'  
I'm getting' all the lovin' I can  
  
You're leadin' me astray  
I'm pleadin' - I'm leadin'  
You're feedin' - I'm beggin'  
  
Waitin' - seems like all my life  
Skatin' - livin' on thin ice  
Dreamin', schemin'  
You're gonna do me in  
  
Waitin' - When are you gonna come back?  
Strung out - You got me on the rack  
Duckin', divin'  
I'm gonna be midnight drivin'  
  
You're takin', I'm breakin'  
  
I'm shakin' and it's makin' me bad - I'm so sad  
I'm reelin' all the feelin'  
I'm reelin' all the feelin' I can  
  
I've got to make you stay  
You're leavin' - I'm grievin'  
You're sellin' - I'm buyin' - you're lyin'  
  
You're prayin' and I'm layin' a plan  
I'm gettin' all the lovin'  
I'm gettin' all the lovin' I can  
  
You're leadin' me astray  
I'm pleadin', I'm needin'  
You're feedin', I'm beggin'  
  
I'm shakin' and it's makin' me bad - I'm so sad  
I'm reelin' all the feelin'  
I'm reelin' all the feelin' I can  
  
I've got to make you stay  
You're leavin' - I'm grievin'  
You're sellin' - I'm buyin' - you're lyin'
