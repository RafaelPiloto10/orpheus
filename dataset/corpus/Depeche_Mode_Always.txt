The well is dry and the streams runs shallow  
The sun is high and the field lies fallow  
My tongue is tied and my body aching  
Now I'm opened wide and afraid of breaking  
  
The food is hot and the table's ready  
But the stomach knots make my hands unsteady  
So I take to pacing and up and down the room  
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's consumed  
  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
  
The bed is made and the candles burning  
All your games are played and the clock keeps turning  
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting  
And the dagger stick as the doors keep shutting  
  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
Always, always, always, always (forever)  
Always (forever), always (forever)  
Always (forever), always
