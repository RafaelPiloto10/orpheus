[Nicki Minaj]  
Excuse me little mama  
But you get say I'm on duty  
I'm lookin for a cutie  
With a big ol ghetto booty  
I really like your kitty cat  
And if you let me touch her  
I know you're not a bluffer  
I'll take you to go see usher  
I keep a couple hoes  
Like santa I keep a vixon got that dasher, dancer, prancer,  
Dixon, comet, cupid, doner, blixen.  
I'm hotter than 100 degrees  
A lot of bread no sesame seeds  
If I'm in yo city  
I'm signin them Tig-O-bitties  
I'm plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy  
The girls want a Minaj yeah they wetter than the rain then  
Usher buzz me in  
Everybody loves Raymond
