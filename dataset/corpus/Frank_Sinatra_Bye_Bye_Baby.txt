Bye bye baby,  
Remember you're my baby  
When they give you the eye  
Although I know that you care  
Won't you write and declare  
That though on the loose  
You are still on the square  
  
I'll be gloomy  
But send that rainbow to me  
Then my shadows will fly  
Though you'll be gone for a while  
I know that I'll be  
Smiling with my baby  
By and by  
Bye, bye baby, so long!  
Bye bye baby  
Just you remember that  
You're my baby when  
  
When they give you the eye  
And although we know that you care  
You just write and declare  
That though on the loose  
You are still on the square  
I'll be gloomy, gloomy  
But send that rainbow to me  
Then the shadows will fly  
Though you'll be gone for a while  
I know that I'll be smiling  
With my baby by and by  
Bye, bye baby
