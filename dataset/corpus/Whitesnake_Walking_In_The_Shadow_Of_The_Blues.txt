I love the blues,  
They tell my story,  
If you don't feel it you can never understand  
So many times I thought about it  
And now I know just what it means to be a man  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait, or hesitate.  
'Cause I love the life I live,  
I'm gonna live the life I choose,  
You gotta understand  
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
All of my life I've had a strange reputation,  
I've been the black sheep of the family all along  
I never know if in my heart I'm really guilty  
But, I've been accused of never knowing right from wrong  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait, or hesitate.  
'Cause I love the life I live,  
I'm gonna live the life I choose,  
You gotta understand  
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
My father said you're crazy,  
He said what you gonna do?  
I left with my guitar and said  
I'll leave it up to you  
  
I'm gonna live the life I love  
And live the life I choose,  
And I'm walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
I love the blues,  
They tell my story,  
If you don't feel it I will tell you once again  
All of my life I've been caught up in a crossfire,  
'Cause I've been branded with the devil mark of cain  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait, or hesitate.  
'Cause I love the life I live,  
I'm gonna live the life I choose,  
You gotta understand  
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues,  
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues
