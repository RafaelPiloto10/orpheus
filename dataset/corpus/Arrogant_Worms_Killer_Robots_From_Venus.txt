About 6 months ago, someone came by with a petition  
Said we'd wanna stop these folks moving in next door  
I refused to sign and told him everyone was welcome  
'Cause that's what neighbourhoods are for  
So they moved in and I'll admit they look peculiar  
They invited me to a friendly barbeque  
Glad I got to know 'em, and let me tell you something  
They may be metallic, but they're just like me and you  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They gave me zucchini from their garden yesterday (they're very fresh)

You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!  
My buddy Charlie never got off the robots' backs  
Then one day, him and his whole house disappeared  
I talked about it to my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus  
They couldn't help me, but agreed that it was wierd...

They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party  
Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty  
They got excited as we counted down with them  
And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)  
I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny  
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal  
I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?  
Could it be them after all?  
No. They're so nice! Yeah.  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They applauded for my kid at the Christmas play (he was the best  
Shepard)  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!

You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK! (We're OK!)
