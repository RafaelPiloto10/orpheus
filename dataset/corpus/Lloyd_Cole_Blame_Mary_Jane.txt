Blaming Mary Jane I'm drinking cheap  
She's getting prettier by the ....  
She says I should care more for  
The rich and the poor but I  
Can't find the energy blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
Speak plain Mary Jane  
Could you give your hand to a man that  
Never gave a damn  
That's why I rather sleep than thinking  
Nothing more than drinking  
All I want is to blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the long lonesome  
Afternoons, yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the lonesome afternoon  
Oh maybe I won't be your whipping boy  
I won't be your whipping boy  
Shame baby shame oh shame sweet Mary Jane  
I truly do love you  
She said that I should care more  
For that body of yours  
If you carry the weight of the world oh my  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the long lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Maybe I will be your whipping boy  
Maybe I will
