Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
His mind is up his sleeve  
And his talk is make believe  
  
Oh, Lord, the man's a fraud  
He's a flim flam man  
He's so cagey  
He's a flim flam man  
  
Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
He's the one in the Trojan Horse  
Making out like he's Santa Claus  
  
Oh, Lord, the man's a fraud  
He's a flim flam man  
He's a fox  
He's a flim flam man  
  
Everybody wants him  
The people and the police  
And all the pretty ladies disarmed  
  
Oh, oh, yeah, the beautiful gent  
You know he has hardly a cent  
He pays his monthly rent  
With the daily charm  
  
Hands off the man  
Flim flam man  
His mind is up his sleeve  
And his talk is make believe  
  
Oh, Lord, the man's a fraud  
He's a flim flam man  
He's an artist  
He's a flim flam man  
  
He's so cagey  
He's a flim flam men  
He's a fox  
She's a fool  
Flim flam man  
  
Oh, don't worry  
He's dishonest  
So don't believe him  
He's a flim flam man  
  
Oh, he's so cagey  
He's a flim flam man
