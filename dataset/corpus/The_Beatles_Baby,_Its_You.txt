It's not the way you smile that touched my heart  
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart  
  
But how many many many nights go by  
I sit alone at home and cry over you  
What can I do, can't help myself  
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you  
  
You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)  
They say, they say you never never ever been true (cheat, cheat)  
  
Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say  
I know I'm gonna love you any old way  
What can I do, then it's true  
Don't want nobody, nobody  
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you  
  
Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say

Baby it's you, don't leave me all alone
