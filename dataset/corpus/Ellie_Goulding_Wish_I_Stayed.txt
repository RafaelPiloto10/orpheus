Why can't we speak another language  
One we all agree on  
When men look outside, they see houses  
Instead of the fields they grew from  
We are constantly uprooted from them  
Making us tiresome (and fearful)  
Can you get up right now  
Endeavor to free fall?  
  
You can fall if you want to!  
It's just a matter of how far  
You've treasured our hometown,  
But you've forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
Patterns all arranged in my background  
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form  
Letters were all sent  
With no addresses so that people can't discover  
That we're always under cover  
Why do I always draw triangles?  
Instead of words this paper deserves  
  
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,  
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find  
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,  
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
You can fall if you want to!  
It's just a matter of how far  
You've treasured our hometown,  
But you've forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed
