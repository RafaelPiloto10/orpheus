I see houses  
Rows and rows  
Of red bricks  
I see black cars  
Some  
Blood-stained exit  
You got  
A feeling that you  
You've been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ah-ah-ah  
Before your freedom  
Ah-ah-ah  
  
I see mountains  
Blood-red sunsets  
I see  
A billion stars  
Love deafened  
And betrayed  
You got  
A feeling that you  
You've been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ah-ah-ah  
Before your freedom  
Ah-ah-ah  
  
Don't be late  
  
You got  
A feeling that you  
You've been  
In here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many tears  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Ah-ah  
  
You got a feeling  
That you  
You've been  
Here before  
How many lives  
Will you waste  
How many blood  
Must you taste  
  
Before your freedom  
Oh  
  
It's just  
This murder  
Trouble and strife  
Turning me  
Into another guy  
It's just murder  
Trouble and strife  
Turning me  
Into another guy  
  
Oh  
  
Don't be late  
Don't be late  
Don't be late  
When I call you up  
  
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh  
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh  
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh  
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh  
  
Ooh  
Oh-my, my, my, my  
My, my, my, aaah
