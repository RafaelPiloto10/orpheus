I said, "Take it easy, baby  
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead  
You got my shirt tails  
Flyin' all over the place  
And the sweat poppin' out of my head"  
  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on a workin', child  
This ain't no time to quit"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
I'm about to have myself a fit"  
Bossa Nova, Bossa Nova  
  
I said, "Hey, little mama  
Let's sit down  
Have a drink and dig the band"  
  
She said, "Drink, drink, drink  
Oh, fiddle-de-dink  
I can dance with a drink in my hand"  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
This ain't no time to drink"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
'Cause I ain't got time to think"  
  
I said, "Come on, baby  
It's hot in here  
And it's oh-so cool outside  
If you lend me a dollar  
I can buy some gas  
And we can go for a little ride"  
  
She said, "Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
I ain't got time for that"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
Or I'll find myself another cat"
