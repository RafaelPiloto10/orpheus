Although I speak in tongues  
Of men and angels  
I'm just sounding brass  
And tinkling cymbals without love-  
  
Love suffers long-  
Love is kind!-  
Enduring all things-  
Love has no evil in mind  
  
If I had the gift of prophecy-  
And all the knowledge-  
And the faith to move the mountains  
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-  
If I didn't have love  
I'd be nothing  
  
Love-never looks for love-  
Love's not puffed up-  
Or envious-  
Or touchy-  
Because it rejoices in the truth  
Not in iniquity  
Love sees like a child sees  
  
As a child I spoke as a child-  
I thought and I understood as a child-  
But when I became a woman-  
I put away childish things  
And began to see through a glass darkly  
  
Where, as a child, I saw it face to face  
Now, I only know it in part  
Fractions in me  
Of faith and hope and love  
And of these great three  
Love's the greatest beauty  
Love  
Love  
Love
