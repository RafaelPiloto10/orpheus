I wish I had a talking book  
That told me how to act and look  
A talking book that contained keys  
To past and present memories  
A talking book that said your name  
So if you were gone, you'd still remain  
More than a picture on a shelf  
In imagination I could touch  
A talking, talking book  
  
I wish I had a talking book  
Filled with buttons you could push  
Containing looks and sights, your touch  
Your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs  
How much I'd bluster to ask it why  
One must live and one must die  
  
I wish I had a talking book  
By my side so I could look  
And touch and feel and dream, a look  
Much bigger than a talking book  
A taste of loving future and past  
Is that so much to really ask  
  
In this one moment's time and space  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love ever, forever be replaced  
Can our love ever be replaced  
Can our love ever be replaced  
(Can our love really be replaced)  
By a talking book
