We used to talk about the rock and the roll  
That made it matter not to sell your soul  
Like a banner that we held so high, we weren't afraid to fall  
Steady rolling through the warning signs  
That were hidden in between the lines  
That kept us rocking till the break of day  
Or any break at all  
  
We used to take about a day and a night  
To try to sing up all the soul in sight  
And anyone who couldn't see the light  
We had to leave behind  
And the sweetest thing you ever heard  
Was the singing of the speckled bird  
And commercial was a dirty word  
We laid it on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
It was all so easy then  
We could do no wrong  
We'll never be the same again  
But the show goes on  
  
We used to drink about a bucket of booze  
To try to chase away the black and blues  
And when it came the time to pay your dues  
You gave an I.O.U.  
To the devil with the dirty smile  
Which he added to the growing pile  
Of the promises you mean to keep  
The day your dreams come true  
  
[Chorus]
