Stand up, and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
'Cause you know that feeling  
When you've got your back against the wall.  
My God, it's only Tuesday tomorrow  
And "Loved One's" gone and blown it all  
Now you've got no money and you feel your back against the wall.  
  
Well, if you talk to your brothers and they don't give a damn  
And you look like you're gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall.  
  
Some Tripper's got you right in a corner  
And you feel you're gonna lose it all  
Now you don't want trouble but you feel your back's against the wall.  
  
So the guy moves forward but you hold him away  
Shit there's no one there to hear you call  
So you take your chances and you push him back against the wall.  
  
Now the guy's in the gutter and you don't give a damn  
And he looks kind of weak and small  
'Cause you called his number when you felt your back against the wall.  
  
Stand up, and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
'Cause you know that feeling  
When you've got your back against the wall.  
  
Well, if you talk to your brothers and they don't give a damn  
And you look like you're gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall.
