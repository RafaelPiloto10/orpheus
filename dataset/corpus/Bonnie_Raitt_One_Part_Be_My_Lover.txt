When he looks into her eyes  
He sees only the truth  
Telling him he's been living a lie  
over and over like a line in a song  
About all the love he let pass by.  
  
To her he might be the man of her dreams  
To find where she's been hiding inside  
Broken or battered, it really doesn't matter  
Her heart's like a wave and he's the tide.  
  
They're not forever they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
He's like a boxer who had to retire  
After winning but killing a man  
He's got all the moves and none of the courage  
Afraid to throw a punch that might land.  
  
Not too much later she can't meet his glance  
You see her start pulling away  
Over and over like fire and ice  
One is color, one is grey.  
  
They're not forever, they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
So if you know how  
Why don't you say'em a prayer  
They're need all the help they can get  
They remember too much about what went wrong  
It might be they should learn to forget.  
  
Forget themselves in each other  
And leave what belongs in the past  
Carry their hearts like a newborn child  
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.  
  
They're not forever,they're just for today  
One part be my lover,one part go away.
