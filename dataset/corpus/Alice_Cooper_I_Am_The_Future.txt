When does a dream become a nightmare?  
When do we do what must be done?  
When do we stand and face the future?  
When there is nowhere left to run?  
  
And you've got to learn  
Just how to survive  
You've got to learn  
How to keep your dream alive  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And you belong to me  
  
When does a dream become a nightmare?  
When do we learn to live with fear?  
When we cry out for some salvation?  
Why is it no one seems to hear?  
  
You've got to learn  
It's up to you  
If you can learn  
That the dream just might come true  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
The world belongs to me, yeah  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
Now, how do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And the world it belongs to me  
It belongs to me  
  
It's all mine  
Just take a look at my face  
I'm the future, no disgrace  
Take a look at my face  
This world belongs to... To me
