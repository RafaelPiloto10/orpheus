Here's a token of my openness  
Of my need to not disappear  
How I'm feeling so revealing to me  
I found my mind too clear  
I just need someone to be there for.. me  
I just want someone to be there for.. me  
  
All the static in my attic a  
Shoots down my side nerve  
To the ocean of my platitudes  
Longitudes latitudes it's so absurd  
I just need someone to be there for..  
I just want someone to be there for..  
Someone to be there for..  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'll stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Ooh, let's call in an angel  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'll stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
No way  
No way, no way  
Let's call in an angel  
Who's calling an angel?
