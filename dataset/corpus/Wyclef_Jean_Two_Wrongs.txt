I'm just sittin' here playin' the guitar  
  
City High-i-i  
Claudette and 'Clef  
  
Excuse me if you see me screamin'  
But deep in my mind  
I'm only dreamin'  
'Cuz if I wake girl and you're  
Not by my side  
I feel like half of me  
Is no longer alive  
So please, shorty  
Before you walk out that door, boopy  
Would you listen to my song  
  
If only, I'd give you one last chance (One last chance)  
With the devil you can no longer dance  
You've got to be faithful  
So we can be fruitful  
Build a family and follow God's destiny  
So just before I run to the block, Papi  
I might listen to your song  
  
Ooh, before you walk out that door  
Listen  
  
They say two wrongs don't make it right  
(Don't make it right)  
So if I'm wrong I ain't tryin' to fight  
I'm tryin' to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
(So papi I won't leave baby I'll just stay)  
(But promise me that you'll do the same)  
Girl I'ma love you like I never loved you  
(Touch me like you never touched me)  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl I'm gonna show you  
  
Now baby, understand  
That I forgive you  
But I ain't gonna forget  
That you brought me regret  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
But I have grown  
From a thug to a man  
Built my castle with bricks  
And no longer with sand  
  
And just, before I run to the block, baby  
I might listen to your song  
  
Ooh, before you walk out that door  
Listen  
  
They say two wrongs don't make it right  
(Don't make it right)  
So if I'm wrong I ain't tryin' to fight  
I'm tryin' to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
(So papi I won't leave baby I'll just stay)  
(But promise me that you'll do the same)  
Girl I'ma love you like I never loved you  
(Touch me like you never touched me)  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl I'm gonna show you  
  
I'm so used to the pain that I  
Can't see the sunshine no more  
I'm so used to the pain that the  
Love sickness feels like the cure  
  
But if only you gave me  
The keys to your soul and let me in  
I'm gonna love you over  
(Over)  
And over (over) again  
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea  
  
They say two wrongs don't make it right  
(Don't make it right)  
So if I'm wrong I ain't tryin' to fight  
I'm tryin' to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
(So papi I won't leave baby I'll just stay)  
(But promise me that you'll do the same)  
Girl I'ma love you like I never loved you  
(Touch me like you never touched me)  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl I'm gonna show you  
  
I ain't gonna stand on the block no more  
I'm gonna come home early girl, I promise
