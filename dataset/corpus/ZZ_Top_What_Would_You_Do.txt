What would you do if you was to love me?  
What would you do if I loved you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in a sinner than fall in lose  
What would you do if you was to kill me?  
What would you do if I killed you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in sin than fall in lose  
Sometimes someone gets down and out  
Sometimes someone gets love divine  
What would I do if you was to fuck me?  
What would you do if I fuck you too?  
I know that I fuck like a sinner  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue
