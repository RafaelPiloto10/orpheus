I've been waiting for the sky to clear, to get me  
Out of here,  
Get me on my way and go  
I've been waiting for a sign to appear,  
To show me the way to a place I've never known  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel, it's givin' me  
The feelin' that my dream  
Came true today  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
From the moment that I close my eyes, feel the  
Sun it rise, hear it echo through my soul  
For the first time in this young man's life, makes  
Me feel alive,  
Fills my heart and makes me stronger  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel, it's givin' me the feelin' that my dream came
true today  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
Someplace closer to both our hearts  
Somewhere further than where we are  
Just as long as there's hope enough  
Long as I live and breathe  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
