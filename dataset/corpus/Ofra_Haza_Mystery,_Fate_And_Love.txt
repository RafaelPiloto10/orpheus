All my life I'm waiting for you  
Mystery, fate and love...  
To pray for you, but you, merahef...  
Far away... Ne'elam  
Oh, mystery, fate and love  
Mystery, fate and love...  
My Lord, my Lord, give me a chance,  
Give me a hand to hold on to,  
Give me a chance, give me a hand  
To hold on to...  
Oh, mystery, fate and love.  
  
All alone, all alone  
Be'emuna ubit'filam tefilah ho  
But you merahef, far away ne'elam  
Oh, mystery, fate and love  
Mystery, fate and love...  
My Lord, my Lord, give me a chance,  
Give me a hand to hold on to,  
Give me a chance, give me a hand  
To hold on to...  
Oh, mystery, fate and love.  
  
Ashayah... Shayah... Ayah
