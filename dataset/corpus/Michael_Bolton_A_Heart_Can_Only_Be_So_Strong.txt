A hundred times I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
A thousand nights, I have sworn not to stay, ooh oh  
I remained tangles in the chains of desire, ooh  
I know that it's no good  
I shouldn't be here  
I know I should leave you  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be  
A hundred ways you have captured my soul  
I can't hold on, but I can't let go  
Your spell on me is a spell I can't break, ooh oh  
All my strength burning in the flames of desire, ooh  
I don't wanna stay here  
I don't wanna leave you  
Don't know how to leave you  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
(Oh, so strong)  
Oh, so strong  
I can't let go  
So strong, yeah  
'Cause you're a part of my soul  
And I, I can't escape you  
No matter how hard I try  
I can never be free of your hold on me  
(Oh, so strong)  
Oh, I can't let go, oh  
A hundred times, I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
(In your eyes I know)  
That a heart can only be so strong  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
(In your eyes I know)  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong
