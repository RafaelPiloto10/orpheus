[Verse:]  
Tell us all again what you think we should be,  
What the answers are, what it is we can't see.  
Tell us all again how to do what you say,  
How to fall in line, how there's no other way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
But oh, we all know  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Show us all again that our hands are unclean,  
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need.  
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved,  
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And oh, you will know  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same (all the same, all the
same).  
Guilty all the same (all the same, all the same)  
You're guilty all the same!  
  
[Rakim]  
Yeah, you already know what it is.  
Can y'all explain, what kind of man is destined?  
When a man has plans of being rich,  
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?  
Dirty money scheme, a clean split,  
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy.  
Talk team, they take the paper route,  
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.  
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience.  
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me.  
Smoke scream, we're going in flames,  
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be,  
Say it's time for things to change.  
We arrange that dope product we built cheap,  
Anything if it's more to gain.  
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep,  
Until no more remains, but I'm still me  
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio  
You record companies kill me  
Try to force me to strain it, no way  
They got the gall to say "yo, how real can real be?"  
You feel me? You will see, the greed will be to blame  
Greedy for the fame, tv or a name  
Media, the game, to me your all the same  
You're guilty.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same (all the same, all the
same).  
Guilty all the same (all the same, all the same),  
Guilty all the same.
