you come to me girl  
tears are in your eyes  
your head's bowed in sorrow  
you whisper your good-byes  
  
there's nothing I can tell you  
to make you want to stay  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
I've seen this moment coming  
for such a long, long time  
I've laid awake for hours  
rehearsing every line  
  
but now that it's here girl  
can't think of anything to say  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
every time that  
I get next to her  
I'm hung up in this ring of fire  
  
if I love her  
should I let her go  
or should I beg on a bended knee?  
  
how much longer  
lord, I just don't know  
I just can't take it girl  
I'm breaking up o'er you  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
after you  
after you leave
