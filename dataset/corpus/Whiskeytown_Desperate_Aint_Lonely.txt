I try not to drink,  
'cause if I sit and think I'll go crazy  
Desperate ain't lonely  
Though I've been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime I'm lonesome in the nightime I'm sad  
  
The letter I wrote,  
Took words from my throat I was saying  
Lay on the roadside  
I guess the mailman was drunk  
The message was urgent  
How lazy a state where you don't live no-one  
  
So I try not to drink,  
'cause if I sit and think I'll go crazy  
Desperate ain't lonely  
Though I've been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime I'm lonesome in the nightime I'm sad
