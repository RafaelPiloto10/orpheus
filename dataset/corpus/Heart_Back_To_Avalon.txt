Forgive me I can't stay here anymore  
I'm leaving with the tide  
This evening another breeze blew 'round my door and stirred me up inside  
I'm breaking out of this tired old spell  
I played it out long and so well  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Where I'm going all my demons disappear  
I'm leaving them behind  
I'm travelling way up on the atmosphere  
'Cause I made up my mind  
Gonna find my love  
Gonna find my life  
Gonna look them so deep in the eye  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Nobody knows what's inside my head or down this road  
Oh I know I'm going home  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon
