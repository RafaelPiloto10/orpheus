Well I don't know why I was dreaming about you  
But I do know that I was dancing without you  
Then you smiled, and I was lost  
You fall in love, why count the cost?  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth living for  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth giving more  
  
If I'd had my way this would have happened much sooner  
But until that day it was only a rumour  
All at once you changed my life  
And led me in to paradise  
  
Where I had to do  
What I wanted to  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I reserve the right to live  
My life this way, and I don't give  
A damn when I hear people say  
I'll pay the price that others pay  
  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I reserve (what?)  
The right to live (where?)  
My life this way (how?)  
I couldn't give  
A damn when I (what?)  
Hear people say (who?)  
I'll pay the price  
That others pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why
