Three in the morning and I gotta be someplace,  
I don't remember where  
friends try to make me stay, or call me a cab home,  
I grab my keys and a beer  
  
Cops they took my license away,  
got my car out of impound today  
I've been drunk since last Saturday,  
better stay out of my way  
  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
Never take that dive  
Feel so alive  
Doing 95  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
I drink and drive  
  
Early in the morning and the freeway's deserted, like its all mine  
I'm trying to set a new drunken speed record,  
but I can't drive a straight line  
Flashing lights, split the night  
I'm tossing bottles as I swerve to the right  
now I've slammed my face into the back of a big rig  
At least you'll never get me, you fucking pigs!  
Designate someone other than me,  
I'm so drunk I can hardly see  
Another shot of Jager and I turn the key,  
I got so many places to be  
  
When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe  
They won't drive at night  
'Cause way down on the freeway it's such a fright  
But I think I drive alright
