Girls don't go crazy  
  
Woman, hold your man tight  
  
Every day I love him just a little bit more,  
A little bit more, a little bit more  
Everyday I love him just a little bit more  
And he loves me the same  
  
Every day I love her just a little bit more,  
A little bit more, little bit more  
Everyday I love her just a little bit more  
And she loves me the same  
  
Baby if you want to get on  
  
Oh baby if you want to get off  
  
It makes no sense at all  
  
I saw red  
  
I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that  
  
I shot dead  
  
Everyday I wake up just a little bit more  
Feelin' like a dog out on the yard  
Because that's just how we are  
  
Everyday I wonder if it's over  
When I wake up realizin' that we hate  
And brake down the war  
  
You say it's black, but I can't believe you  
  
And if you say it's white,  
You say I'm tryin' to deceive you  
  
And I'm aware of the high and the low,  
And I'd be waiting for you in the middle but I just lack control  
  
Baby if you want to get low  
  
Oh baby if you want to get high  
  
It makes no sense at all  
  
I saw red  
  
I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that  
  
I shot dead  
  
Girls, don't go crazy,  
Girls, don't go crazy,  
Oh girls, don't go crazy when the men use you, oh  
  
Oh, woman hold your man tight  
If it makes you feel right, it's your own life
