If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.  
  
Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,  
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,  
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.  
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.  
  
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,  
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.  
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,  
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.  
  
You can shave my head, clean as my hand  
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,  
I would tear this old building down.  
  
You read about Samson, all from his works,  
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.  
One day when Samson was walking along,  
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.  
  
He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,  
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,  
I would tear this old building down.  
  
Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,  
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.  
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,  
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.  
  
He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.  
The bees made honey in the lion's head.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,  
I would tear this old building down.
