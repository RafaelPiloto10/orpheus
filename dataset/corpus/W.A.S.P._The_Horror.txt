There's a red worm crawling in my head  
Cut in half worm, in my blood he lies red  
And I see him in my head  
It's my nightmare, oh it's my dream  
He's inside here silencing my screams  
Alone on a razor's edge  
Alone sliding on the razor's edge  
  
I'm the horror on the edge  
Cause I, I'm the worm that cometh  
I am him I am hell, I am god, I'm the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes  
  
A killer's listening to horrors in my head  
He's bleeding, sliding on the razor's edge  
Through my eyes he watches me  
He lies inside watching me  
There's a red noise deep inside my head  
An obscure noise and the smell of slow death  
If there's a hell then I'll be there  
  
I am god, obscene death  
I'm the worm on razor's edge  
All pigs die  
Kill, fuck, die  
  
I am hell, godless me  
I am pagan idolatry  
Kneel before the horror  
Kneel before the horror  
Fuck me, kill me, drink my blood  
Fuck me, kill me, drink my blood  
All pigs die, kill, fuck, die  
  
I'm the horror on the edge  
Cause I, I'm the worm that cometh I am him I am hell  
I am god, I'm the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes
