Old man sunshine, listen, you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it, and I'll start a riot  
  
Oprah Winfrey don't you dare  
Ever tell me she will care  
I'm certain, it's the final curtain  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Polly-annas  
Who tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas  
  
They're writing songs of love,  
But not for me  
A lucky star's above,  
But not for me  
With love to lead the way  
I've found more skies of gray  
Than any Russian play  
Could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall  
And get that way  
Hi ho, alas  
And also, lack a day  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me  
  
It all began so well  
But what an end  
This is the time  
A fella needs a friend  
The climax of the plot  
Should be a marriage knot  
But there's  
No knot for me  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me
