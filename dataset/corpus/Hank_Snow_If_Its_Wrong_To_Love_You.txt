If it's wrong to love you wrong I'll alway be  
Though the world may scorn me darling can't you see  
If it's wrong to want you when my day is through  
Gladly I will pay for all my dreams of you  
(Though we met too late dear and you'll never know  
That without a right to I have loved you so)  
I can't change my heart dear you're a part of me  
If it's wrong to love you wrong I'll always be  
Though we met too late dear...
