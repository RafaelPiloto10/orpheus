The silicon chip inside her head,  
Got switched to overload  
Nobodys gonna go to school today,  
Shes gonna make them stay at home,  
And daddy doesn't understand it,  
He always said she was good as gold,  
And he can see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reason do you need to be shown  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I want to shoot the whole day down  
  
The telex machine is kept so clean  
And it types to a waiting world,  
Her mother feels so shocked  
Fathers world is rocked  
And their thoughts turn to  
Their own little girl  
Well sweet 16 aint she peachy keen,  
And it aint so neat to admit defeat,  
There could be (no reasons)  
Because there are (no reasons)  
What reasons do you need, oh,  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I'm gonna shoot the whole day down, down, down  
Ill shoot it all down  
  
And all the playings stopped in the playground now  
She wants to play with her toys a while  
And school is out, oh and soon we will learn that  
The lesson today is how to die  
And then the bullhorn crackles,  
And the captain tackles  
With the problems and the hows and whys  
And he can see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reasons do you need to die, die, oh  
  
And the silicon chip inside her head  
Gets switched to overload, oh  
And nobodys gonna go to school today  
Shes gonna make them stay at home  
And daddy doesn't understand it  
He always said she was good as gold  
And he could see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reason do you need to be shown  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like, I don't like  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like, I don't like  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I want to shoot the whole day down
