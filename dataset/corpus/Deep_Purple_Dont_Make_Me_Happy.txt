You stare into the room, nothing there but space  
No sign of any message gone without a trace  
But I don't want your pity, if that's what you think  
I'll take my comfort from this hole I'm sinking in  
Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money  
That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy  
  
It's nice here in this room, you would like it, yes you would  
It's got a bed, two chairs and a table, I'd leave here if I could  
There's a man standing up who's down on his knees  
Outside the cold wind sends a shiver through the trees  
On the line, left behind, under pressure  
It's so bad, leave me be, I don't want to get better  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy  
  
I don't care what you think but think about this  
It could have been somebody else, beware of what you wish  
Now the door is closed, locked and sealed  
And now you think you know how rejection feels  
Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money  
That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy
