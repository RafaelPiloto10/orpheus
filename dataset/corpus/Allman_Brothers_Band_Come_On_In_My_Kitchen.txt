You better come on into my kitchen  
Cause it's sure to be raining outdoors  
When a woman's in trouble  
Everybody puts her down  
  
She look for her good man  
Lord he can't be found  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
  
Because it's going to be raining outdoors  
There's a cold wind blowing  
Leaves tremblin' on the trees  
Don't you know that that good girl  
  
Ya she's leaving me  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
  
The woman I've been loving  
Left with my best friend  
That joker got lucky  
Stole her back again  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Well that good girl's leaving  
She ain't coming back  
Took her last nickel from her notion sack  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Mama's dead and gone  
Father's no where's to be  
I ain't got nobody  
To love and care for me  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors  
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors
