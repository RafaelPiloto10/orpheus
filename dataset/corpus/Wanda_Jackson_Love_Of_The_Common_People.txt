Livin' on free food tickets water in the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came through what can you do  
Tears from little sister cryin' cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch  
For the party to go oh but she knows she'll get by  
Cause she is livin' in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to  
Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can and she can  
It's a good thing you don't have a busfare  
It would fall through the hole in your pocket  
And you'd lose it on the snow on the ground a walking to town to find a job  
Tryin' to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone boy you'd better go home where it's warm  
And you can live in the love  
  
Livin' on dreams ain't easy  
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit and the chills stay away  
You take 'em in stride family pride you know that faith is your foundation  
And a whole lot of love and a warm conversation and plenty of prayer  
Making you strong where you belong  
And you can live in the love,  
Oh yes we live in the love
