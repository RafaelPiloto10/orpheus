One by one, doing the crime  
Never thought twice, never did time  
Never turn back, never go home  
Never get used to being alone  
One by one, into the sea  
Too many eyes are staring at me  
Two by two, watch as they go  
Who are you and what do you know  
I got your heart in hand  
Never let go  
  
Make it  
Take it  
Never let go  
Tell all you know  
This is what you make it, pound the ground  
Make it  
Take it  
Never let go  
Tell all you know  
How far can you take it as you go... Ironbound  
  
Two by two, iron to bend  
Keeping the oath, right to the end  
Three by three, breaking some bones  
Snapping some neck, never alone  
Here they come, rumble and pound  
Never get used to hearing that sound  
There they go, fast as they came  
Never go back, never the same  
  
All my friends are green and black  
All my friends are right  
All my friends are automatic  
They all rule the night  
All my friends are think and thin  
They've loyalty and heart  
Said all of them are green and black  
Everyone is right  
All my friends are automatic  
Born to rule the night
