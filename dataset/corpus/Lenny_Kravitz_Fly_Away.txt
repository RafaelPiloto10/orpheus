I wish that I could fly  
Into the sky  
So very high  
Just like a dragonfly  
  
I'd fly above the trees  
Over the seas in all degrees  
To anywhere I please  
  
Oh I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Let's go and see the stars  
The milky way or even Mars  
Where it could just be ours  
  
Let's fade into the sun  
Let your spirit fly  
Where we are one  
Just for a little fun  
Oh oh oh yeah !  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I got to get away  
Feel I got to get away  
Oh oh oh yeah  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah with you yeah yeah  
Oh Yeah !
