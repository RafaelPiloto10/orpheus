I got lots of money but it isn't what I need  
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me  
And I got all the symptoms count 'em 1,2,3  
First you need, then you bleed, and when you're on your knees  
(That's what you get for falling in love  
You get a little but it's never enough  
That what you get for falling in love)

I don't need no needle to be givin' me a thrill  
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill  
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track  
I got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back  
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack  
When you need, then you bleed, on you knees

You get a little but it's never enough  
That what get for falling in love)

You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
