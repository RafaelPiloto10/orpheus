Well, this is my last connection , I been slowing up the line.  
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine.  
Gotta get back to the highway , gonna get back to where I know.  
'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,  
Gotta go man, gotta go.  
  
Hell, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool.  
And if the sun don't set on my house babe,  
I'd be the last man to blow my cool.  
I feel my body shake.  
Well, there's so much left to say.  
Spend my life anticipatin'.  
Gonna find a way.  
  
Hey, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
So so tired.  
So so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Well, I don't believe in ev'rything you say just to save my soul.  
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole.  
Gotta take me from my suicide.  
Now you know it's love I crave.  
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave.  
  
So so so so tired.  
So so so so tired.  
I'm so so so so tired.
