Come pleasure me again. I'm so tired of digging in.  
I've done my share, don't need to win, just let me go easy.  
For two years my body fights. At this point it don't seem right.  
Just to do it out of spite and keep hanging on.  
Go on let me go easy.  
Won't you let me go easy, you let me go right now.  
I see the numbers dwindling, of my enemies and of my friends.  
And still I know it never ends, so I'm passing you this torch.  
Fight the greed and the federals. Fight the need and the toxic spills.  
Drink from that wishing well, but may it never quench your thirst.  
Let me go easy.  
Go on let me go easy. Won't you let me go easy, you let me go right now.  
Let me go easy.  
Go on let me go easy. Won't you let me go easy, you let me go right now.  
So when you get to Ladenville, 'fore the tears the fare thee wells, for a
moment stand real still and you'll me moving on.  
You go ahead with your plans, you won't be seeing me again, but you'll feel me
in the hand, the hand that holds the plough.  
Let me go easy.  
Go on let me go easy. Won't you let me go easy, you let me go right now.  
Let me go easy.  
Go on let me go easy. Won't you let me go easy, you let me go right now.
