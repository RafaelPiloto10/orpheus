Sex!  
  
Sex on the brain  
Pumped in my veins  
Flowing from my head to my feet  
Sex on TV  
Rotation heavy  
You and I are what we eat  
Sex when I'm all alone  
It calls me on the phone  
Can't stop this ringing in my ear  
Sex in excess  
Filling all our senses  
Keep saying there's nothing to fear  
  
Can't you read the writing on the wall  
Can't you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is porno-graffitti  
All I hear porno-graffiti  
See no, hear no  
All I speak porno-graffitti  
All I fear porno-graffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex in 3d  
No evil eyes see  
Too much of it and you'll go blind  
Sex education  
Misinformation  
Kiss me where the sun don't shine  
Sex it surrounds me  
Porno-graffiti  
It's all so constitutional  
Sex is literate  
Read all about it  
But censor where you all can go  
  
Can't you read the writing on the wall  
Can't you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is porno-graffitti  
All I hear porno-graffitti  
See no, hear no  
All I speak porno-graffitti  
All I fear porno-graffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex sells
