Taking time to find myself  
Seeing how I've been so crazy  
Still I don't love you  
Being in love has been my crime  
My heart beats have been so lazy  
Still I don't love you  
I've been lost this time with feelings  
Do you know my mind?  
I don't  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
But I don't know why  
And I don't know  
I don't know  
  
When I ran away to hide  
Then I made a thousand changes  
I'm sorry I don't love you  
Thinking of the pain inside  
And the way it always tasted  
Sorry I don't love you  
I've been thinking more about you  
And I know my mind's....crazy  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
Am I'm never gonna know why?  
Why I don't love you  
  
I lied in fear  
Like a little child  
And I don't know why  
  
Now I have to cry  
Tears are gonna tell you why  
Why I don't love you  
I don't know....  
  
(whispered) I'll never leave you  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
Am I'm never gonna know why?  
Why I don't love you....yeah  
  
I lied in fear  
Like a little child  
Yet I don't know why  
  
Now I have to cry  
Tears are gonna tell you why  
Why I don't love you....yeah
