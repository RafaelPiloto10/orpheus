When spring comes around my love  
When spring comes around  
When winter is gone the hills are green  
Song of the lark is clear and clean  
I long for the lands I've never seen my love, my love  
When summer comes around my love  
When summer comes around  
As soon as I feel that sudden breeze  
I hoist my sail to the seven seas  
And let the wind take me where it please my love, my love  
When autumn comes around my love  
When autumn comes around  
As soon as the leaves begin to fall  
I'll anchor in some port of call  
I'll write a letter sending you all my love, my love  
When winter comes around my love  
When winter comes around  
The world will be white with silent snow  
The temperature down to ten below  
And home to the warmth of you I go my love, my love  
When spring comes again my love  
When spring comes again  
You and the lams will play again  
And though I will want to stay again  
You know I'll be on my way again my love, my love
