It's a rainy afternoon  
In 1990  
The big city geez it's been 20 years-  
Candy-you were so fine  
  
Beautiful beautiful  
Girl from the north  
You burned my heart  
With a flickering torch  
I had a dream that no one else could see  
You gave me love for free  
  
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go  
All my life you're haunting me  
I loved you so  
  
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go  
Life is crazy  
Candy baby  
  
Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left  
I'm glad you got out  
But I miss you  
I've had a hole in my heart  
For so long  
I've learned to fake it and  
Just smile along  
  
Down on the street  
Those men are all the same  
I need a love  
Not games  
Not games  
  
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go  
All my life you're haunting me  
I loved you so  
Candy, candy , candy I can't let you go  
Life is crazy  
I know baby  
Candy baby  
  
You you you  
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go  
All my life you're haunting me  
I loved you so  
  
Candy candy candy  
Life is crazy  
Candy baby  
  
Candy baby,  
Candy, candy
