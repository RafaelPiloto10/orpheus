Wake up, wake up....  
Turn on the water  
Close the door  
I won't let you tear me down  
Just another moment  
When the sound of your voice  
Cuts me to the ground  
Locked in here just to make  
Myself feel better  
Look in the mirror  
And tell myself that I'm okay  
I know it doesn't matter  
Whatever I do  
It's always second best  
I gotta free my mind  
Exactly what you wanted  
You opened me up  
The secrets I confessed  
Wake up, wake up  
I'm not here just to  
Make you feel better  
Stroke your ego  
Live happy ever after  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
Anymore  
So many times  
I wanted to go  
But I just lost my way  
Watching you unravelling  
The last piece of thread  
That held me into place  
I don't care if you hear a word  
I'm saying  
I can only hear  
The voices screaming in my head  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
And I'm sick of dreaming pain  
Tossing and turning all night and waking wide up  
Now I'm really looking at the door should've made this move before  
I can't take this anymore  
I don't want no more nightmares in the night  
No not tonight  
I already seen the light  
I gotta free my mind  
And wake up, wake up  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
Wake up  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
Go to wake up  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
Anymore
