There are times in our lives  
When we all feel inside  
Something's wrong, there's gotta be  
Something better for me  
So we try on our own  
To change our paths  
But we don't realize that joy comes after rain  
And Life begins again  
  
Tomorrow  
Is a better day  
Tomorrow  
You will see the way  
When God is by your side to stay  
Just keep on movin', don't you dare give up  
  
There are times, times we  
Can be swayed so easily  
Doubt can come in my mind  
And I'm ready to give up this time  
But I've got to keep on goin', got to keep on movin'  
Got to keep on pressing it through  
'Cause I know my God is able, oh He's more than able  
It's no thing to take care of you, I say  
  
He knows of everything you're goin' though  
Has enough love to take good care of you  
You know exactly what you need to do  
So just keep movin', don't you dare give up  
He knows of everything you're goin' though  
Has enough love to take good care of you  
You know exactly what you need to do  
So just keep movin'
