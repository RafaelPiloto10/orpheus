Holding on to the past

The tears in our eyes  
Feed happiness for the next miles

Evoke artificial lightning  
Watch out cause it can strike you  
The remedy is inside you

Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode feel free to interact with the plot  
The choice can really mean a lot
