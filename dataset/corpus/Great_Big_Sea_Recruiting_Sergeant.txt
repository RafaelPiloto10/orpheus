Two recruiting sergeants came to the clb,  
For the sons of the merchants, to join the Blue Puttees  
So all the hands enlisted, five hundred young men...  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
They crossed the broad Atlantic in the brave Florizel,  
And on the sands of Suvla, they entered into hell  
And on those bloody beaches, the first of them fell...  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus:  
So it's over the mountains, and over the sea  
Come brave Newfoundlanders and join the Blue Puttees  
You'll fight the Hun in Flanders, and at Galipoli  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
The call came from London, for the last July drive  
"To the trenches with the regiment, prepare yourselves to die"  
The roll call next morning, just a handful survived.  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus  
  
The stone men on Water Street still cry for the day  
When the pride of the city went marching away  
A thousand men slaughtered, to hear the King say  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me
