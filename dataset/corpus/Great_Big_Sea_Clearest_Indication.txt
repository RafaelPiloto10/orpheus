You left in the morning  
You left without a word  
Did you get what you came for?  
Is this what I deserve?  
  
Oh I know  
The silence was the loudest thing  
I've ever heard  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication  
I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Did we have all we wanted  
And let it slip away in time?  
Like a country divided  
Fifty one to forty nine.  
  
Years ago  
I suppose we just can't seem to make up our minds  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Oh times like these it's hard to see  
With any kind of clarity  
What's the point of wondering anymore?  
So much I just can't figure out  
I'd love to know without a doubt  
For sure, for sure  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you (x4)  
From you.
