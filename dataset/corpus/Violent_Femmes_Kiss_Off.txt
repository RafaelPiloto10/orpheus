I need someone a person to talk to  
Someone who'd care to love  
Could it be you could it be you  
Situation gets rough then I start to panic  
  
It's not enough it's just a habit  
Hey kid your sick well darling this is it  
You can all just kiss off into the air  
Behind my back I can see them stare  
  
They'll hurt me bad but I won't mind  
They'll hurt me bad they do it all the time  
Yeah yeah they do it all the time  
I hope you know this will go down  
  
On your permanent record  
Oh yeah well don't get so distressed  
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed  
  
I take one one one cause you left me and  
Two two two for my family and  
Three three three for my heartache and  
Four four four for my headaches and  
Five five five for my lonely and  
Six six six for my sorrow and  
Seven seven for no tomorrow and  
Eight eight I forget what eight was for and  
Nine nine nine for a lost god and  
Ten ten ten ten for everything  
  
Everything everything everything
