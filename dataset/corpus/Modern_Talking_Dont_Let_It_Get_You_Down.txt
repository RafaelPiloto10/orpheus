I'm crying through the night  
A cry of loneliness  
Strangers side by side looking for a kiss  
You feel your heart is dead  
Oh like a broken toy  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Your heart is out of tune  
These tears can never dry  
I'll save your heart, babe, soon  
Oh baby give a try  
A sound of breakin' hearts  
I hear again and again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Take my helping hand  
  
Don't let it get you down  
It's never too late  
Don't leave this heartbreak town  
Feel the love we'll make  
Harder you'll try the more you get  
Oh your heartbeat is too sad  
Come keep your heart just burning in the night  
For you and me  
  
You're tired of been alone  
But time is on your side  
You'll make it on your own  
Baby, if you'll try  
Holding back the tears and mend a broken heart  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Never give you up  
Somewhere there's a friend  
When rain is in your heart  
Babe, don't let it end  
Oh light the flame of love  
Oh, call me just again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Where the rainbow end
