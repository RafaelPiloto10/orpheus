I love the way you stand in my way  
You won't move 'til you get a kiss  
And how you tell me that my name  
It tastes so sweet on your lips  
  
I love the way you hold me with your eyes  
Hold me so tight that I can't move  
It's like everything I've ever known is a lie  
And you're the simple truth  
  
Is it a dream or is it real?  
All I know is you make me feel so beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful  
  
You make me feel so beautiful  
(Feel like I could fly)  
Beautiful  
(Cross the clear blue sky)  
  
Beautiful  
(Baby I could cry)  
You make me feel so beautiful  
  
I love how soft you touch my skin  
Like you're touching the wings of a butterfly  
I wish we could just lock ourselves away in a room  
Where there was no such thing as time  
  
I've never let anyone get this close  
I've always been afraid  
But you break down every wall  
And I feel so safe  
  
Every part of who I am  
Is so in love cause what I have is beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful  
You make me feel so beautiful  
  
(Feel like I could fly)  
Beautiful  
(Cross the clear blue sky)  
Beautiful  
(Baby I could cry)  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Beautiful...  
You make me feel so beautiful  
  
(When you touch my face)  
Beautiful  
(When you say my name)  
Beautiful  
(Always find the way)  
You make me feel so  
Beautiful
