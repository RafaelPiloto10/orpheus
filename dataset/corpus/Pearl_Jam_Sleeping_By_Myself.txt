I should have know there was someone else  
Down below I always kept it to myself  
Now I believe in nothing  
Not today as I move myself out of your sight  
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
I could never go with no one else  
The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell  
Now I believe in nothing, but the pain  
And I can't see this turning out right  
Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
Forever be sad and lonely  
Forever never be the same  
Oh I close my eyes and wait for a sign  
Am I just waiting in vain?  
  
Oh I close my eyes and wait for a sign  
Am I just waiting in vain?  
  
Oh I believe in love and disaster  
Sometimes the two are just the same  
I'm beginning to see  
What's left of me is gonna have to be free to survive  
  
Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
I believe in nothing, but the pain  
And I can't see this turning out right  
Oh I'll be sleeping by myself  
I'll be sleeping by myself  
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
