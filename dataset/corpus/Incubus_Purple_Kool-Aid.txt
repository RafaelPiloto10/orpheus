Woke up I wiped the sleepers from my eye  
Looked up to see ??? ??? ???  
??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? too  
Up in the ??? ??? ??? with you  
They call themselves the purple kool-aid cult  
They lost their head and claim it's all my fault  
I'm fed koolaid intravenously  
I must regain my own autonomy!  
[Pre-chorus]:  
The purple kool-aid cult is back, I'm paranoid again  
Would someone please appease all the stress of my,  
[Chorus]:  
Sorry friend, there's no way I can stay  
Wish I could explain the reason why  
I'm being chased so please pardon my haste  
Please appease the stress of my brown head.  
They turned their backs and I began to run  
Looked back for a flash and I began to shout  
I've got to find a passage out of here  
I'm not too certain that the future's clear  
And now I'm alone and to what type too wear  
And then they set upon a skinny chair  
They're gathering now around a sugar throne  
It's red and round and speaks of miracles.  
[Pre-chorus]  
He says ??? ??? ??? him  
Weird ritual for you and I to mate  
I see a door ??? ??? I see astray  
I pick up a furious pace so I can get away  
Don't smile a purple pleasure hangs the cape  
Oh Me, Oh My, It was the great escape  
The situation, it's still to me a bit of a scandal  
Every time I see a purple smile within my underwear.  
[Pre-chorus]  
[Chorus]  
Four years and as many days float on by  
??? carry out that silicone ?? atacious?? left behind  
I'm going next door to celebrate I say  
??? purple ??? koolaid ??? is the punch that's got me drunk today.  
Next thing I know I'm standing on a chair  
whipping my arms around the friendly air  
I preached the words around a year ago  
I now surrender to the certain glow?  
[Pre-chorus]  
[Chorus]  
Ohhohohohohoh!  
I'm being...  
I'm being chased by seven kids high on kool-aid  
But then they're not crazy cause they're high on kool-aid  
But then they're not crazy they're just high on kool-aid.
