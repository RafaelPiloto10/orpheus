They say, "don't stop believing",  
"Give no room to reason",  
"Build it and they will come".  
I've no quibble with that drivel  
It's alright for some.  
But I was born in a European nation  
In the twentieth century  
And what I've seen and what I've learned  
Means it's not right for me.  
  
Thy say, "don't stop believing,  
'Cause if you stop believing  
Very soon you'll regret it".  
But what they believe  
Is you can believe  
And still end up in a fiery pit.  
So I sit in this European nation  
In the twenty-first century  
And I know someone's got it wrong.  
Is it them or is it me?  
  
During the deepest darkest nights  
I feel that they must be right.  
But when I see the morning light  
Science wins again.  
  
They say, "don't stop believing,  
'Cause if you just believe  
Your future's like the shining sun".  
I say "I would believe  
But there's all these beliefs.  
What if I pick the wrong one? "  
When I look at the European nations  
Down through the centuries,  
Every single belief system  
Ended up causing grief, incalculable grief.  
And if you ask me now  
I think that's what I believe.
