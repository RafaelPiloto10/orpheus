It don't matter to the sun  
If you go or if you stay  
I know the sun is gonna rise  
Shine down on another day  
There will still be a tomorrow  
Even if you choose to leave  
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)  
It matters to me  
  
It ain't gonna stop the world  
If you walk out that door  
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)  
Like it did the day before  
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)  
It just keeps on keepin' time  
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)  
But it'll be the end of mine  
  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you...  
  
(GuitarPiano solo)  
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you  
  
It don't matter the moon  
If your not in my life  
No the moon will just keep hangin' 'round (hangin' 'round)  
Like it's just another night  
Find another place to shine on down  
On some other lovers dreams  
'Cause it don't matter the moon (oh baby)  
But is sure do matter to me  
No it don't matter to the moon (oh baby)  
But it matters to me
