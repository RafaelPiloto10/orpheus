I just found out  
It's been too long now  
The word is out  
Time before didn't they take us hook and punker?  
Their "jive alive" lines  
They were funk  
They were hijinx, hijinx, hijinx tonight  
We all know better but we just might  
  
Pullin' this off it's gonna take some  
Big time schemin'  
A fast tap dance, our feet'll be steamin'  
Hijinx, hijinx, hijinx, alright  
Hi, hi, hijinx, yeah, yeah  
  
You never know, behind the lines  
Who's gonna show  
Scandal high's been buzzin' through the mayhem  
Tonight the word, we heard is  
It might be them.  
They were hijinx, hijinx, hijinx tonight  
They all know better, but we just might  
  
Pullin' this off, it's gonna take some  
Big time schemin'  
A fast tap dance, our feet'll be steamin'  
  
Hijinx, hijinx, hijinx, alright  
Hi, hi, hijinx yeah, yeah  
Who's who?  
Who's who?  
Hi, hi, hijinx, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Who's who?  
Who's who?
