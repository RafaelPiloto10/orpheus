She wound the thread around the pieces of, my broken heart  
Had left me to believe  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
The starry nights without a fear of heights  
I can't recall, but I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
A blissful way she whispered in my ear  
Before she left, had me so convinced  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
And Juliet's romantic balcony  
Wears out the wall, and I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I feel alone  
I hope my ghost, never leaves  
'Cause when I'm home  
Your painful memory, is always haunting me  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing to me  
  
When I see you around, my eyes get wide  
When you race through my mind, I die inside  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I hope you think of me, I hope you think of me
