I wasn't born in a lap deluxe  
I didn't have no silver spoon  
We all dream 'bout mega bucks  
Like wishing for the moon  
They say money just buys you problems  
Bigger taxes, jealousy  
Big decisions on what to do with it all  
That's the kind of problem I mean  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then I'm gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
'cause I'll never wanna go back there  
I thought I'd been in love  
But it's a feeling I can't trust  
'cause nine times out of nine I find  
I've been head over heels in lust  
Married man say, love's nothing but trouble  
Like it's some kind of terminal disease  
They say love's strange, love is blind, love hurts  
Well, that's the kind of trouble I need  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
I said never, never, never, never - never  
Never come back again - no  
Never come back again  
They say money can't buy you happiness  
And that true love never runs smooth  
They talk of the trouble, and the strife they bring  
Well I don't care, 'cause here's what I would do  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then I'm gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
'cause I'll never wanna go back there  
I said never, never, never, never - never  
Never come back again - no  
Never come back again
