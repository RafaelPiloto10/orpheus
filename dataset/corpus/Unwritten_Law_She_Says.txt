Father I've sinned  
Over and over and over and over again  
Sorry my friends  
I'm such a mess  
I'm doing the best I can  
She says "where ya goin'? where ya been?"  
She says "I don't want you hanging out with them"  
She leaves like she's never coming back again on and on  
It goes on and on yea  
  
She says "I don't love you like I loved you before"  
She says, she says "I don't love you anymore"  
  
And mother I've tried over and over and over to open my eyes  
Look at my life  
Tell me when did I die  
Cause I'm not alive  
Flip through the script and tell me what it says  
Skip through the story tell me how it ends  
She says that we're probably better off as friends  
On and on and yea  
  
She says "I don't love you like I loved you before"  
She says, she says yea  
She says "I don't love you.  
I don't love you anymore."  
She says, she says "I don't love you. I don't love you. I don't love you
anymore."  
She says she says she says "where ya going"  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says "where ya going"  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says "where ya going"  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says "where ya going"  
I know I know I know I know I know  
What I want  
  
You, you called the police  
You called them on me  
And I want to go anywhere but home  
I, I'm done listening to what's wrong with me  
Cause it goes on and on and on and on YEA  
  
She says "I don't love you like I loved you before"  
She says she says, yea  
She says "I don't love you. I don't love you anymore"  
She says, she says "I don't love like I love you anymore."
