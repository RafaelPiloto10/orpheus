We know you really only want to hear  
The things we like to say  
But if I said to you please don't do it  
You do it anyway  
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel  
Be cruel to be kind  
When I ask you, what you see in me  
You say our love is blind  
  
'Cause only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
Only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
  
Whenever I think I know you better  
Better than I know myself  
I open up and give you everything  
Then you say, okay what else  
And when I run away you always cry  
You always over react  
But I don't know if you know how you really feel  
But you better know before I get back  
  
'Cause only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
Only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
  
Just try to remember  
Now I'm the one you love  
You told me, ooh try to remember  
I'm the one you're always thinking of  
You told me, please try to remember  
Before I walk away  
Remember  
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday  
  
'Cause only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
Only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
  
Only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say, yes  
Only you know and I know  
The things we mean to say  
  
Only you know and I know
