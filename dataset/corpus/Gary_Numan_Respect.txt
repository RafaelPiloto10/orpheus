That's OK  
If that's the way you wanna play it  
I don't mind  
I can play it anyway  
You won't stop  
Until I pul you to pieces  
Which I will in time  
But I'm still curious  
You're so young  
Not one backbone between you  
But you think you'll make a hero  
Quite peculiar  
You're just boys  
You don't know what you've angered  
Did you know you're talking to the heart  
Of the machine?  
Welcome boys  
Welcome to the real world  
I could almost be sorry  
But I could be wrong  
I know you  
I know what you've been doing  
I know where you live  
And I know where you are  
You know me  
I'm the smiling assassin  
You know I won't forgive  
And you know I won't forget
