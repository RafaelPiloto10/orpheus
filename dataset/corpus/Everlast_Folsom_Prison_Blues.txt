I hear the train a comin'  
It's rolling round the bend  
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,  
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on  
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton...  
When I was just a baby my mama told me  
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
Now every time I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry...  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car  
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars  
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a movin'  
And that's what tortures me...  
  
Well if they'd free me from this prison  
If that railroad train was mine  
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away...
