She came to the party  
In a leather number wrapped in chains  
Investigation found  
She was very fond of dropping names  
So I signed her book  
And drove her to her home  
And she looked so hot  
Started to come on strong  
Then she said so candidly  
As I was gettin' down on my knees  
"I don't really mean to tease  
But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy"  
Camouflage  
That's nothin' but camouflage  
  
He was totally handsome  
With a winning personality  
Natural born leader  
With connections in society  
But late at night  
Alone with just his wealth  
He would stare in the mirror  
And never see himself  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
He had a hit with every song  
Sounded like something's wrong  
Why, why, why, why, why  
  
Camouflage  
It ain't nothin' but camouflage  
Camouflage  
Ain't nothing but, nothin' but  
Nothin' but camouflage  
  
They were so well suited  
With an ambiance you can't ignore  
But nobody realized  
What went on behind closed doors  
He had many affairs  
But never felt fulfilled  
She would hide her sadness  
In alcohol and pills  
She bottled everything up inside  
He was too busy with his best friend's wife  
They couldn't look each other in the eyes  
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage  
Just camouflage  
Everywhere you go it's called camouflage  
Some people hide behind camouflage  
  
see A-M-O you F-L-A-G-E  
  
I signed her book, drove her to her home  
But I didn't know what was goin' on  
  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
Had hits with every song  
  
He had many affairs but never felt fulfilled  
She was hidin' herself in some little purple pills  
  
Why, why, why, why  
Shy, shy, shy, shy  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Talkin' 'bout camouflage  
camouflage, bring it down  
  
Sometimes I worry about you darlin'  
You wear too much mascara  
Too much eyeliner  
Too much rouge, and it worries me  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Camouflage, talkin' 'bout camouflage
