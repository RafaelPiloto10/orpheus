When I look into your eyes  
See the world cut down to size  
Baby don't apologize  
Takin' me one step over the line  
  
When I touch your secret skin  
Babe I know it ain't no sin  
I feel you startin' to give in  
Now let's go one step over the line  
  
I know it's just your daddy's car  
Your daddy never went this far  
Baby we know who we are  
Let's go one step over the line  
  
I can be your drivin' wheel  
We could make those tires squeal  
Ooo I like the way it feels  
Takin' it one step over the line  
  
One step forward and two steps back  
It's for the first time baby  
I'm talkin' cake walkin' into the black  
A crossin' red line and I don't mean maybe  
  
I hear they buried lover's lane  
In a sea of tears and blame  
It's you and me go up in flames  
Baby, one step over the line  
  
They're drawin' boxes on the ground  
Just to make us look on down  
All we gotta do is look around  
And take it one step over the line  
  
A one step over the line  
Come on baby, one step over the line
