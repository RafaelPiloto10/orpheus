Trailers for sale or rent,  
Rooms to let, 50 cents,  
No phone, no pool, no pets,  
Ain't got no cigarettes, ah but  
Two hours of pushing broom  
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room  
He's a man of means by no means  
King of the road.  
  
Third box car midnight train  
Destination bangor, maine  
Old worn-out suits and shoes,  
Don't pay no union dues.  
He smokes old stogies he has found  
Short, but not too big around  
He's a man of means by no means  
King of the road  
  
(He knows) every engineer on every train  
All of their children and all of their names  
And every hang-out in every town  
Every lock that ain't locked  
When no one's around.  
  
I say, trailers for sale or rent,  
Rooms to let - 50 cents,  
No phone, no pool, no pets,  
Ain't got no cigarettes.  
I've got two hours of pushing broom  
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room  
He's a man of means by no means  
King of the road [Repeat: x4]
