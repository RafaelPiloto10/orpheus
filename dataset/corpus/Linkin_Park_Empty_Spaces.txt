I am not a pattern that we follow  
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal not a role model  
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame  
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain  
And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
Because once you get a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first  
And I'm not a robot. I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
Stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker  
  
Pac said money changes situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step I ain't the one  
Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
  
I'm awfully underrated but pay me to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for record  
I am the opposite of where I got this  
A weak opposite, a slack sending them  
A heat sending them  
A crack closest to a peak  
Far from a punk  
Ya'll better start trying to catch up motherfucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker  
  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker
