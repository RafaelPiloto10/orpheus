They keep looking through the window  
A cathode glaze across their eyes  
Now that I've been betrayed  
I must be well behaved...  
I'll drink corruption with their lies.  
  
Why was I hiding out?  
What am I running from?  
Why are they waiting?  
Have I always been the chosen one?  
  
Drag him to the roof  
Just push me over  
I've got no better place to be  
Drag him to the roof  
Let's get it over  
It's a perfect day to punish me.  
  
I wish that lady would defend me  
I can't abide by all the laws  
I'll buy the magistrate, can't be a second late  
I anxiously await his call.  
  
Who made this jigsaw puzzle?  
Who'll put the pieces back?  
Who'll come and get me when I have fallen through the cracks?  
  
Drag him to the roof  
Just push me over  
I've got no better place to be  
Drag hime to the roof  
Let's get it over...  
It's a perfect day to punish me.
