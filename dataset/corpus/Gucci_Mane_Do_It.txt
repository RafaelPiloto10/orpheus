Why you painted that motherfucker? You didn't have to do it  
Why you flood yo wife? You know that you didn't have to do it  
It was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it  
It was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it  
It's Gucci Mane izay, you know we overdo it  
They back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it  
They got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it  
They know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it  
  
Don't need no stylist, I'm so fresh, I didn't even have to do it  
My car cost half a million dollars and I didn't have to do it  
I paint that bitch instantly and put them Forgies to it  
I merk a nigga instantly, this shit here more than music  
As far as me, them niggas phony, that's balony music  
These niggas so corny I'd be baloney if I listened to it  
I paint my car soon as I get it, bitch I gotta do it  
And get how many, can even a man take car paint that's on a Buick  
I make a bitch feel insecure but she still listen to it  
She in the car, don't know what it is but ain't like she knew  
You with a nigga with a check, this a Rari not a Vette  
This ain't that same little lick that he got, man this Bentley cost 3-20 man  
It's Gucci, I got plenty, me in city, we be killin shit  
Soon as you take drop man it's gon be trinity and it's have her 50  
I have my mind on a V, I'm trappin out abandoned buildings  
They say the rims on my Charger bitch are bigger than they children

Took my car service to Slawson, bought 10 Patriot from the 60's
