Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely  
Vale  
Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud  
Eagle  
Where pride and ancient glory fade  
Such was the land where he was laid  
Like Christ was thirty pieces paid  
For Avondale's proud eagle  
  
Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely  
  
Vale  
Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud  
Eagle  
Long years that green and lovely glade  
Have lost for now our grandest Gael  
And Cursed the land that has betrayed  
Our Avondale's proud eagle
