What good is a photograph of you  
Every time I look at it  
It makes me feel blue  
  
What use is a souvenir  
Of something we once had  
When all it ever does is  
Make me feel bad  
  
I wish I could tear it up  
But then again I haven't the guts  
I wish I could throw it on the fire  
I wish I could  
But to say I would  
I'd be a liar  
  
What good is a color print  
Of a little baby doll  
When just one little glance  
Is enough to make me feel dull  
  
I hoped I would misplace it  
But then I take such good care of it  
I wish it would disappear  
I say I wish  
But then I relish  
It being here
