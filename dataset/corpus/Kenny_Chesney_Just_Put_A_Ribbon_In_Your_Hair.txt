Bobby wants a 10-speed, an English racer  
Jenny wants that fuzzy teddy-bear  
Now your asking me  
What I'd like from Santa, for Christmas this year  
There's a lot of things, girl you could buy for me  
But they wouldn't mean as much, as you standing by that tree  
  
Just put a ribbon in your hair, darlin'  
You'll be the best gift anywhere  
Christmas Mornin'  
There's no worldly treasure  
Id like any better, than you standin' there  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
  
(Mmmm...)  
  
Colored boxes filled, with fancy presents  
They were mighty pretty sites, it's true  
But all those pretty things  
They just can't compare  
To the beauty in you  
Girl on christmas day  
The greatest gift I know  
Will be having you to hold  
Underneath the mistle toe  
  
Just put a ribbon in your hair, darlin'  
You'll be the best gift anywhere  
Christmas Mornin'  
There's no worldly treasure  
Id like any better, than you standin' there  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
Just put a ribbon in your hair  
  
(Oohhh baby)
