Because of curiosity  
All the Vandals had to see  
The golden throne  
Of Ancient Rome  
And brought the city to its knees  
  
Because of curiosity  
  
Because of curiosity  
I'm just riddled with anxiety  
I'm the lowest level  
As a matter of fact  
I often dwell for days on this  
  
But when I see your smiling face  
I'm so disgraced  
And if you're holding out on me  
I get curious  
As curious as I can be  
  
Curious  
Because of curiosity  
  
Curiosity killed the cat  
But satisfaction brought it back  
In terms of this cat  
As a matter of fact  
I'll meet you at the old mouse hole  
I'll meet you at the old mouse hole  
  
When I see your smiling face  
I'm so disgraced  
If you're holding out on me  
I get curious  
As curious as I can be  
Curious as I can be  
Curious as I can be  
  
Yeah, curiosity
