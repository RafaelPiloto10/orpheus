I miss you so much  
Your light, your smile, your way  
And everything about us  
Though you're gone  
Your still here  
  
In my heart  
In my tears  
Yeah you sure left your mark  
We were just getting started  
  
It wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough together  
But it was long enough  
Yeah it was long enough to last forever  
  
Sometimes I get so mad  
I scream I swear at this  
'Cause this isn't how we planned it  
  
I sit here in a cold room  
Praying, waitin' on you  
To run back through that door  
To the way it was before you left  
  
It wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough  
Together  
But it was long enough  
Yeah it was long enough  
To last forever  
  
Been cheated, defeated  
Can't believe that you're are gone  
You're gone, You're gone  
Oh it was wrong, so wrong  
  
It wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough  
No it wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough together  
But it was long enough  
Yeah it was long enough to last, to last, to last forever  
  
It wasn't long enough [Repeat: x3]  
No, it wasn't long enough  
It wasn't long enough [Repeat: x3]  
It wasn't long enough [Repeat: x2]
