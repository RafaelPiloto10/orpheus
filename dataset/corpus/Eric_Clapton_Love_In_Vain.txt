Well, I followed her to the station  
With a suitcase in my hand  
Lord, I followed her to the station  
With a suitcase in my hand  
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell  
When all your love's in vain  
All my love is in vain  
When the train pulled up to the station  
And I looked her in her eye  
When the train pulled up to the station  
And I looked her in her eye  
I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome  
And I could not help but cry  
All my love is in vain  
Well, the train, it left the station  
Two lights on behind  
Well, the train, it left the station  
With two lights on behind  
Well, the blue light was my blues  
The red light was my mind  
All my love is in vain  
Ooh, Willie Mae  
Ooh, ooh, Willie Mae  
All my love is in vain
