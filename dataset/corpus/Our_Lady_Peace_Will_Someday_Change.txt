You say that love is a disease  
Restless in its company  
Like a river to the sea is where you run  
You say that all the birds have flown  
The heart an antique turned to stone  
There is comfort in this great unknown  
  
[Chorus]  
And all that you've known  
And all that you say  
All that you've known will someday change  
  
You say forgiveness don't last long  
You hear the ticking of the bomb  
Leaves you wondering where it all went wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Light will lead us all like harmless spirits traveling  
Light will lead us all like harmless spirits traveling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all that you've known
