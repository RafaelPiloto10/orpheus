They call him Joe The Dragon  
He's on the water wagon  
He's got that look of mourning and concentration on his face  
Carries a 38 special  
A six inch barrel  
The saddest damn man in the entire human race  
  
Mojo (4x)  
  
Joe's mind is full of motors(?)  
He is always taking photos  
Of the remains of his beserk little twists  
Yes ....(?) polaroids  
Of his little golden boys  
18 carat corpses with wired wrists  
  
Mojo (4x)  
  
Blood thicker than water will flow  
The fire will eat the streets of old Soho  
Daddy's out the back with little Joe  
With his vaseline and his violin and bow - Mojo  
  
Down on Compton(?) Road  
Joe ain't never going home  
Till he finds what he is searching for  
Well mad Mathildas in his jacket  
They crank and make him record(?)  
As he does and make his funny little laugh and dance upon your floor  
  
Mojo (repeat)
