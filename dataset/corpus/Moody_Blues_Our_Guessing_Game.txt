Walking in the sand  
Thinking of things, adventures in my mind  
Tall ships that sail  
Across the ocean wide  
They won't wait for me  
See the way they glide away so gracefully  
And with tomorrow what will become of me  
They leave me so much to explain  
That's the start of our guessing game  
  
There are times when I think I've found the truth  
There are times when I know that I'm wrong  
And the days when I try to hide my fears  
Bless the days when I'm feeling strong  
Bless the days when I'm feeling strong  
  
Wonder why we try so hard  
Wonder why we try at all  
You wonder why the world is turning around  
When in the end it won't matter at all  
  
Standing in the town  
Looking at people, counting their frowns  
Unhappy faces, hurrying around  
So blind they cannot see  
All of these things  
The way life ought to be  
And with tomorrow what will they make of me  
It leaves me so much to explain  
That's the start of our guessing game  
  
There are times when I think I've found the truth  
There are times when I know that I'm wrong  
And the days when I try to hide my fears  
Bless the days when I'm feeling strong  
There are times when I think I've found the truth  
There are times when I know that I'm wrong  
And the days when I try to hide my fears  
Bless the days when I'm feeling strong  
There are times when I think I've found the truth
