If your mind is in the darkness, could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind  
  
And as soon as you discover where you're goin'  
Can I walk along the way, along the way  
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowin'  
Just a few nice words to get me through the day  
  
If your mind is in the darkness, could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world just a frame of mind  
  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone  
  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone  
  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone [Repeat: x4]  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
