Confide in me  
Religh on me  
And I will try to satisfy  
Your every need  
Through the day  
'Till we say goodnight  
  
Take it slow, easy go  
Any friend would recommend  
The starlight show  
On a night like this  
I insist you try  
  
Oh, now I know the nights will last  
Morning sun is shining through  
So close the door  
And let the whole world passes by  
While I confide in you  
  
If you take the time  
You will find  
A smile face, warm embrace  
A sympathetic mind, to do it right  
Confide in me tonight  
  
Oh, now I know the nights will last  
Morning sun is shining through  
So close the door  
And let the whole world passes by  
While I confide in you  
  
Confide in me  
Religh on me  
any wish, you've ever missed  
Is guaranteed  
There's a peace of mind  
You will find  
Confide in me tonight  
Ooh, confide in me tonight
