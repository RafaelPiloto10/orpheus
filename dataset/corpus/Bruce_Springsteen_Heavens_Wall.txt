There was a woman waiting at the well  
Drawing water 'neath the desert sky blue  
She said, "It'll heal the blind, raise the dead, cure the sickness out of you"  
Come on men of Gideon  
Come on men of Saul  
Come on sons of Abraham  
We waiting outside heaven's wall  
  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
  
He saw a watcher at the city gates  
Jonah in the belly of the whale  
He watched you walk your ragged mile  
His mercy did not fail  
  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
Hey!  
  
Li li-li li, li li-li li  
(Li li-li li, li li-li li)  
  
Whoa! Whoa!  
  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)
