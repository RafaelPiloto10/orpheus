Ooh, you're always in the back of my mind, ooh  
Nothing ever changes, oh, I wish to God it did  
Just another drink and you'll be gone  
Oh, it's two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me, down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
I thought time would burn it  
Burn it down to the ground  
Just another breeze and you'll be strong  
Oh, I'm driving home, all on my own  
Just a passenger in all that we lost  
Satisfy, oh, Lord, don't deny  
I see your face in the everything that's near 'cause  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, I have all the memories, the winter of eighty-two  
When down upon the ice you saw me melt  
Oh, it's two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me, down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, washed up on the rocks again  
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot  
And the things you do?  
I won't ever learn, ooh, I won't ever learn  
Oh, washed up on the rocks again  
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot  
And the things you do?  
I won't ever learn, I won't ever learn  
Ooh, I won't ever learn, I won't ever learn  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
In the back of mind  
You're in the back of mind  
In the back of mind
