I knew what I wanted and I was fixed on it I was sure of it,  
I could've been wrong  
It seems like it's never quite like I thought it'd be the reality,  
Am I where I belong?  
  
It's not like they said it feels like most everything's out of focus  
In my mind I'm trying to make some sense out of what I left behind  
The difference in who I am and the one want to be  
It seemed so much easier when there was something to believe  
  
A different perspective now and the world I see is in front of me,  
And everything's wrong the grass was so much greener when it was next to me  
Now it's under me, am I where I belong?  
The world, it only seems to change from where you look much different  
Than the pictures that they took it's nothing like they said it would be
