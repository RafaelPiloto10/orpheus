I like your smile  
I like your vibe  
I like your style  
But that's not why I love you  
And I, I like the way, you're such a star  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La, la  
la, la, la, la  
la, la  
la, la, la  
  
I like the way you misbehave  
When we get wasted  
But that's not why I love you  
And how you keep your cool when I am complicated  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
And I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
yeah, oh, oh, oh,  
oh, oh, oh, oh  
Even though we didn't make it through  
I am always here for you  
yeah,  
  
oh you're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
now the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)
