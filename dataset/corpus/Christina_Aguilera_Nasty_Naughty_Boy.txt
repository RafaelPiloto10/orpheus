Come here, big boy  
Ah, mm, yeah  
  
You've been a bad, bad boy  
I'm gonna take my time, so enjoy  
There's no need to feel no shame  
Relax, and sip upon my champagne  
'Cause I wanna give you a little taste  
Of the sugar below my waist, you nasty boy  
  
I'll give you some oh-la-la  
Voulez vous coucher avec moi?  
I got you breaking into a sweat  
Got you hot, bothered, and wet  
You nasty boy  
  
Nasty, naughty boy  
  
Oh baby, for all it's worth  
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind  
Now, if you're ready, come and get me  
I'll give you that hot, sweet, sexy loving (loving)  
  
Hush now, don't say a word  
I'm gonna give you what you deserve  
Now, you better give me a little taste  
Put your icing on my cake  
You nasty boy  
  
Oh no, oh there I go again  
I need a spanking 'cause I've been bad  
So let my body do the talkin'  
I'll slip you that hot, sweet, sexy loving  
  
Oh, ha!  
Come on, daddy!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah  
Oh yeah, oh, come on, sugar  
  
I got you breaking into a sweat  
Got you hot, bothered, and wet  
You nasty boy  
  
Nasty, naughty boy  
Naughty boy  
  
Oh baby, for all it's worth  
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind  
Now that you're ready, give it to me  
Just give me that hot, sweet, sexy loving  
  
Now give me a little spanking  
Oh, oh, is that all you've got?  
Come on now, don't play with me  
  
Oh, give me that hot, sweet, nasty  
Boy, don't you make me wait  
Now you better give me a little taste  
Put your icing on my cake  
You nasty boy  
  
Mm
