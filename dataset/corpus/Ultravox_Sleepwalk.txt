Sleepwalk.  
  
Rolling and falling, I'm choking and calling,  
Name after name after name.  
  
Sleepwalk.  
  
Naked and bleeding, the streetlights stray by me,  
Hurting my eyes with their glare.  
  
Sleepwalk.  
  
Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces,  
Destined, we had to collide.  
  
Sleepwalk!  
  
Taut on the outside, I'm crumpling and crawling,  
Watching the day drag away.  
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers,  
Rip round my throat as I dream.  
  
Dream!  
  
Sleepwalk.
