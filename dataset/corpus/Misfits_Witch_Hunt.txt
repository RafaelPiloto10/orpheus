Wipe out the weak and dying  
I've got no use for you  
Sent from Hell, I know they're lying  
Just another sacrifice  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
Exterminate the undetermined  
I've got no use for you  
Sent from Hell, I know they're lying  
Hang her by her neck to die  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
We're on a head hunt  
We're on a blood hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
and we're gonna get you  
We're coming after you too  
  
We're on a witch hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
Were under a spell  
We're on a head hunt  
We're on a blood hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
and we're gonna get you  
We're coming after you
