You may go to college.  
You may go to school  
You might drive a pink Cadillac  
But don't you be nobody's fool  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby.  
What I'm talking about  
Come on back me Little girl  
So we can play some house.  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby gone.  
Come back baby I want to play house with you  
  
Well, there's just one thing baby  
That I want you to know  
Come on back we can play a little house  
And we act like we did before.  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby.  
Try to understand  
I rather see you dead little girl  
Than see you with another man  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you
