Mother, you had me but I never had you  
I wanted you  
You didn't want me  
So I just gotta tell you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
Father, you left me but I never left you  
I needed you  
You didn't need me  
So I just gotta tell you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
Children, don't do what I have done  
I couldn't walk but I tried to run  
So I just gotta tell you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home  
Mama don't go  
Daddy come home...
