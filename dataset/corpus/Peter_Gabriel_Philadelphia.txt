Sometimes I think that I know  
What love's all about  
And when I see the light  
I know I'll be all right.  
  
I've got my friends in the world,  
I had my friends  
When we were boys and girls  
And the secrets came unfurled.  
  
City of brotherly love  
Place I call home  
Don't turn your back on me  
I don't want to be alone  
Love lasts forever.  
  
Someone is talking to me,  
Calling my name  
Tell me I'm not to blame  
I won't be ashamed of love.  
  
Philadelphia,  
City of brotherly love.  
Brotherly love.  
  
Sometimes I think that I know  
What love's all about  
And when I see the light  
I know I'll be all right.  
Philadelphia
