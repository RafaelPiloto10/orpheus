Everybody wonders and some people know  
I guess that I'm some people 'cause, baby, it shows  
When will you do it? And why will you go?  
If you've already decided, then deliver the blow  
  
[Chorus]  
The way you walk around me  
The way you talk around me  
You act so speechless  
You've got nothing to say  
The way you walk around me  
The way you're talking to me  
  
Makes me wonder if this was only play  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Do you still love me like you did before?  
  
Said, come on, baby, you think I'm so blind?  
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time  
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name  
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before?  
Oh, baby, you think I'm so blind  
Oh, baby, I'm not playing around this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door?  
Oh, baby, you think I'm so blind  
Oh, baby, I'm not playing around this time
