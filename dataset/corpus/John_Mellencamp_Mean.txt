[Chorus]  
I'm not following your frame of mind  
Complaining about this life all the time  
Surely something good here as the world spins by  
Could you please stop being so mean  
  
This will never work out that's what you say  
It's the end of the world again yesterday  
When I see you coming at me I'm gonna walk away  
You need to stop being so mean  
  
Your outlook is haunting us all  
Like the ghost of our love down at the dark end of the hall  
If you can't say nothing good then don't say nothing at all  
And you need to stop being so mean  
  
Your road seems so narrow to me  
You're a big boat up the river blowing off steam  
My head is spinning from your company  
Could you please stop being so mean  
  
[Chorus]
