Step out into the Indian dust  
I can feel the cracks in my spirit  
They're starting to bust  
  
Drive by your house, nobody's home  
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone  
  
All of my friends say I should move on  
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard  
And of all my friends say it wasn't meant to be  
And it's a great big world, she's just another girl  
  
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip  
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip  
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else  
  
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye  
I got an invitation but I didn't reply  
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves  
And give him all of my love  
  
All of my friends say I should move on  
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard  
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be  
And it's a great big world, she's just another girl  
  
I could be reeling them in left and right  
Something's got a hold on me, tonight  
Well maybe all of my friends should confront  
The fact that I don't want another girl  
  
All of my friends say I should move on  
All of my friends say  
All of my friends say  
All of my friends say  
She's just another girl  
  
Then why can't I sleep at night  
And why don't the moon look right  
The sounds up, the TV's on  
And it's a great big world  
  
She's just another girl,  
Don't let her stick it to your heart, boy  
She's just another girl  
All of my friends say she's just another girl  
Another girl
