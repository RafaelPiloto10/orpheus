I'm so afraid of the mistakes that I made  
Taking every time that I wake  
I feel like a hard-boiled and cut-up man  
So give me a time when the countries  
Will lie on the storyline if kind  
  
Are days are made since the first page  
I've lived every line that you wrote  
Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head  
So give me a time when the countries  
Will lie on the storyline if kind  
  
And if I live on the shelf like the rest  
And if love bleeds like a sad song  
Please pick-up your camera and use me again  
So give me a time when the countries  
Will lie on the storyline if kind, yeah
