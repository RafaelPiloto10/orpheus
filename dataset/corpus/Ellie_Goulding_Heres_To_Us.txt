[Verse 1]  
You're falling at your feet, giving everything up  
There's something in the way, love is never enough  
I see your sorry how I'm burning down the gun  
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won  
I catch you in a light no one else can see  
I know you see her, and you'll never see me  
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive  
But what we had, it never really died  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Verse 2]  
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us  
Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that  
And one day, you and I, we will never look back  
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Bridge: Harmonization]  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Outro]  
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us
