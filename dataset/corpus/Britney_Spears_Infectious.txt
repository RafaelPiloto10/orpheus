So he is all you need  
I'm sayin' all on top of me  
I say I'm tryin' to mean  
So get your ecstasy  
I know it ain't no remedy  
You'se addicted to my pussy  
I'm the only vaccine  
For you aeropostale code  
My lust infectious  
My lust infectious  
My lust infectious  
Gotcha beggin' for more  
My lust infectious  
My lust infectious My lust infectious  
Gotcha sweatin' for more  
My stomachs' got him turnin' back  
Got the bottle baby just relax  
Watch me put on biggy C's  
There's no shirt no panties  
I know baby this ain't my train  
Glad you make it shh on me  
You know I'm gonna make it rain  
So come and fill my heart with la-a-a-a-ove
