[Chorus 2x]  
Let's get it started!  
[Verse 1]  
Now your party wasn't jumping and your DJ was weak  
Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's  
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind  
They all up against the wall like a welfare line  
Do you think for one minute that this is it?  
Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit  
You better put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started  
Get it started!  
[Chorus 5x]  
[Verse 2]  
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete  
I'm movin everybody from A to Z  
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none  
From Doug E. Fresh to LL or DJ Run  
They say hammer how you do it? I got it like that  
My posse's ever rollin, We keep it in tact  
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started  
[Chorus 6x]  
[Verse 3]  
Now, a lot of be -boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat  
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath  
Before the show gets started, They shakin they boots  
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops  
Like a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs  
808 SB12'S are expirin africans  
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started  
[Chorus 5x]  
[Verse 4]  
They said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last  
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas  
Cause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom  
Whatever in effect, Yo, be -boys have got em  
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels  
A mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel  
Just put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started  
[Chorus 7x]
