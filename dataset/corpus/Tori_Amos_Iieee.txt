With your E's  
And your ease  
And I do much more  
Need a lip gloss boost  
In your America  
Is it God's  
Is it yours  
Sweet saliva  
With your E's  
And your ease  
And I do one more  
I know we're dying  
And there's no sign of a parachute  
We scream in cathedrals  
Why can't it be beautiful  
Why does there gotta be a sacrifice  
  
Just say yes  
You little arsonist  
You're so sure you can save  
Every hair on my chest  
Just say yes  
You little arsonist  
With your E's  
And your ease  
And I do one more  
  
Well I know we're dying  
And there's no sign of a parachute  
In this chapel little chapel of love  
Can't we get a little grace  
And some elegance  
No we scream in cathedrals  
Why can't it be beautiful  
Why does there gotta be a sacrifice
