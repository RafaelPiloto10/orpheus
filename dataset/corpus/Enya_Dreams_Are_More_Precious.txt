Come see, high above.  
Come see, high in the heavens.  
A new star shining bright.  
Out of the darkness, comes a light.  
  
Come here, in a child  
Come here, bells that are ringing  
And for some distant shore  
Sounds of a journey, echo on  
  
This is the night  
They say,  
Everyone wants a dream.  
  
This is the night  
They say  
Nothing is as it seems.  
  
Come see, close your eyes.  
Come see, give me your sorrow.  
And I keep watch for you.  
Until the dawn is, breaking through.  
Until the morning wakens you.  
  
Come dream, through the night.  
Come dream, and then tomorrow  
They'll see who, what will know.  
  
Dreams are more precious than gold  
Dreams are more precious than gold  
Dreams are more precious than gold
