I never want to be part of the herd  
I guess I was in case you haven't heard  
Maybe you can tell that I can't stand  
The way I want to be the included  
I always want to be a mystery  
I always knew that two and two made three  
I wish away the time I'm living in  
I never wanna see the smile again  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not for sure  
And I'm feeling  
Like it's not for sure  
Come on and take a drink with me  
Whoa whoa, I don't think you can cope with it  
I don't think you can handle it  
Whoa whoa, Forgive my own forgetfulness  
And take a drink with me  
  
I wanted to be two, but more than one  
I only thought that I could be so dumb  
Crush my heart with your new heels  
I'd beg for you, but I don't kneel  
I understand that you were living there  
It never bothered me that I don't care  
I wonder if I'll act on my impulse  
I wonder if I'll leave if you say go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, would you take a drink with me  
If it's all you can take  
It'll be okay  
If it's all I can take  
Then just put me away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa whoa, I don't think you can cope with it  
So take a drink with me  
  
I never want to be part of the herd  
I guess I was in case you haven't heard  
I wanna spend some time to make you see  
So why not come and take a drink with me?
