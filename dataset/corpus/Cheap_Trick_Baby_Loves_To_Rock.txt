More and more I been thinkin' 'bout love  
Love ain't all I been thinkin' of  
Some people do and some people don't  
Some people will and say they won't  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
More and more I'm thinkin' 'bout s-s-sex  
The more I think the better it gets  
More and more I'm thinkin' bout s-s-sex  
The more I think the worse it gets  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
In the morning, in the evening  
In the summer, in the winter  
In my car, in the night, in an airplane  
Not in russia!  
  
She loves to rock, she loves to rock  
She loves to rock, she loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
More and more I been thinkin' 'bout love  
Love ain't all I been thinkin' of
