Oh, I should have known  
You're late again  
No, no, no, no  
And now I'm here  
Will you appear?  
I don't think so  
  
Every single day  
The same again  
You keep me waiting  
For somebody who don't care at all  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna wanna  
Be no prima donna  
Tired standing waiting feeling like you never wanna  
Say you're trying trying  
Boy I know you're lying  
Telling me we'll never be too late 'cause I was crying  
You're so tricky tricky  
Yeah now mister wicky  
Now it's been an hour  
Make me feeling freaky freaky  
I can't take it take it  
You stole my time and now it's  
Now it's too late  
Now it's too late  
Now it's too late  
  
You didn't wait  
What a mistake  
Always too late, ah  
  
Always too late  
You didn't wait  
What a mistake, ah  
  
I can't take it, you can change it  
Why you did so wrong?  
  
Why you did it? I can change it  
Oh you did so wrong  
  
Where are you today  
You said you'd call  
You said you'd meet me  
10 o'clock, it was no shock  
You were not there  
  
Foolish, 'cause I am  
But then again  
I keep on waiting  
For somebody who don't care, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do I gotta do?  
Take some look or two  
To get over you  
  
You treat me like a fool  
Careless is your rule  
That's why you're so cruel  
  
You didn't wait,  
What a mistake  
Always too late, ah  
  
Always too late,  
You didn't wait  
What a mistake, ah  
  
I can't take it (what do I gotta do?)  
You can change it (take some look or two)  
Why you did so (to get over you) wrong?  
  
Why you did it? (every single day)  
I can change it (the same, the same again)  
Oh you did so (do do do do do) wrong  
  
Now it's too late
