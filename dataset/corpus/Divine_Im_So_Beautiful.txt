Shake it  
Shake it  
Shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
  
Out  
Out tonight  
Feel like going out  
In the night  
I'm gonna walk the street  
Walk the street  
I wanna feel the heat  
Feel the heat  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
Wild  
Feelin' wild  
And I'm burnin' up  
Deep inside  
I'm wanna let it go  
Let it go  
I'm gonna steal the show  
Steal the show  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so beautiful  
You gotta believe it, I am beautiful  
I'm so beautiful  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
I said  
I'm so beautiful  
Well, everybody's welcome to his point of view  
We're all beautiful  
Can't you see?  
  
High  
Feelin' high  
I'm really gonna shake it  
Through the night  
  
I'm gonna nail the beat  
To the floor  
I'm gonna make you scream  
Scream for more  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
CHORUS  
  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
Can't you see?  
  
High  
Feelin' high  
I'm really gonna shake it  
Through the night  
  
I'm gonna nail the beat  
To the floor  
I'm gonna make you scream  
Scream for more  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
