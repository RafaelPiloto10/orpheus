Just something about the way she move  
I can't figure it out  
Is something about her  
  
Say, oh is something about  
Kinda woman that want you but don't need you  
Hey, I can't figure it out  
Is something about her  
  
Cause she walk like a boss  
Talk like a boss  
Manicure nails just sent the pedicure off  
She's fly effortlessly  
  
And she move like a boss  
Do what a boss  
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved  
That's the kinda girl I need  
  
[Chorus]  
She got her own thing  
That's why I love her  
Miss independent  
Won't you come and spend a little time  
She got her own thing  
That's why I love her  
Miss independent  
Oh, the way she shine  
Miss independent  
  
Yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
  
Ooh there's something about  
Kinda woman that can do for herself  
I look at her and it makes me proud  
There's something about her  
  
Something ooh so sexy about  
Kinda woman that don't even need my help  
She said she got it, she got it (she said she got it, she got it)  
No doubt, there's something about her (there's somethin' about her)  
  
Cause she work like a boss  
Play like a boss  
Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off  
And bills are payed on time, yeah  
She made for a boss  
Only a boss  
Anything less she telling them to get lost  
That's the girl that's on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her favorite thing to say, don't worry I got it  
And everything she got best believe she bought it  
She goin' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it, girl  
You're everything I need  
Said you're everything I need  
  
Yeah, yeah yeah,

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Miss independent  
That's why I love her
