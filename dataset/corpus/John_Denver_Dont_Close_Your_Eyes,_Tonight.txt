There's a tenderness that I feel, it's very real you see  
I can feel your body stir so deep within  
Let it be an out of love tonight completely  
And let me ask of you one thing  
  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
Let it be me, not just a fantasy  
Let it be me tonight  
  
Well you can lie so close to someone and still feel alone  
And though I heard you say you loved me so many times  
While you give me love so beautiful and tender  
Someone else is in your mind  
  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
Let it be me, not just a fantasy  
Let it be me tonight  
  
Sorry if I cry - feelings run so deep  
Many is a time when I'll wake up and find  
That I'm crying in my sleep  
Look me in the eye, tell me what you see  
I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one who needs you  
Make this one for me  
  
Don't close youe eyes tonight  
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
Let it be me, not just a fantasy  
Let it be me tonight
