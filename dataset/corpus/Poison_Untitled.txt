(here it comes)  
Well funky monkey's in the jungle tonight  
They got two by two don't hear me right  
  
Band playing loudly baby  
Gone are the days when the days gone  
I said gone  
  
When the monkeys are gone  
Gone or dead this is what they said  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries, cries, cries  
Yeah she does, yeah baby, that is what she did  
Lions sleeps, baby  
The lamb surely dies (??)  
I just don't want to fuck you  
  
That's it  
  
When the jungle sleeps  
Is when the monkey shine  
I said you do baby? Don't mind  
  
Back? Are wild  
If the deuces left in than the deuces are wild  
  
I said baby, well,  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries, cries, cries  
Yeah?  
Lions sleeps, baby  
Dies, dies, dies  
I just don't want to fuck you  
  
Ooooh, kick it!  
  
Solo  
  
Give me some of that  
  
Well dime store cowboy shoot your gun  
Knock them mother fuckers down one by one  
  
Money on up it's in your face  
Gimme no lip or get your face back here  
  
Ooh, got it right  
  
When the monkey don't sleep  
And the money don't shine  
Well, ??  
  
Chorus
