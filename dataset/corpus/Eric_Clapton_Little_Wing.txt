Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus mind that's running 'round.  
Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales,  
That's all she ever thinks about.  
  
When I'm sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free.  
Said, "It's all right, take anything you want,  
Anything you want, anything."

Fly on, little wing.
