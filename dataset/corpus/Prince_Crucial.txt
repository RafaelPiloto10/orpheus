Baby, you've got to be from a different world  
Cause just one look from you could make an army surrender  
Baby, you've got to rescue me girl, girl  
A prisoner in love with the opposite gender  
  
I ain't sayin' you're better, baby, but I ain't sayin' you're not  
I ain't sayin' anything until you stop  
Never forget that 'cause baby, I'll be your jack of all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial - baby, our love has got to be  
Crucial - everything from A to Z  
Crucial - you've got to show me everything, everything, everything  
  
Is that Old Man River knockin' at your door  
Sayin' that we got to let more than our feelings show?  
Baby, tonight don't hold nothin' back, I know you've got some more  
I'll give you mine if you give me yours  
  
I ain't sayin' you're better, baby, I ain't sayin' you're not  
I ain't sayin' anything until you stop  
Baby, don't hold me back 'cause baby, I.. baby I need a jack for all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial - our love has got to be  
Crucial - every little thing from A to Z  
Crucial - you've got to show me everything, everything, everything
