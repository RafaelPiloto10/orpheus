I don't want to waste all this time  
I just wanna start living for real  
I don't want to waste all my time  
Being locked up in my own little movie  
Part of me wants to stay a child  
The other is saying Angelo you better grow up quick  
For God has given you a baby boy  
And he wants you to try and be a good father  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Oh I believe that life can be so wonderful  
As long as I try to treat everyday like my last  
  
I think I'm not thanking God enough  
For all the great presents I've received in my life  
Especially for my beautiful and loving wife  
Oh Kira I think without you I would never have made it  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Having children and a wife is something wonderful  
And I'll never ever trade with something else in this world
