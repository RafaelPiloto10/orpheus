'To the outsider it seems that we in Britain  
Live daily under the cloud of terrorism.  
That familiarity sometimes makes you think of it as almost normal  
Then suddenly something will happen'  
  
We stand, hang our heads disbelieving  
Then not knowing how could such a thing be wrong  
We wonder just what they must be thinking  
To take a life of one so young  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How far must we go, to prove to you?  
  
We wait and we wonder how this happened  
Killing the old, the innocent, the young  
While sons follow in fathers footsteps not understanding  
That what they do could somehow be so wrong  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How far must we go, to prove to you?  
  
So we will wait and we'll wonder  
  
No regrets, no forgiveness, no compassion  
These brave heroes only know to hit and run  
Slowly my sadness turns to rage and we wonder  
How can these scars ever heal, when all is said and done  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How many tears must fall to prove to you?  
Please tell me, when will it be over now, how soon?  
And how far must they go, to prove to you?  
  
So we wait and we wonder
