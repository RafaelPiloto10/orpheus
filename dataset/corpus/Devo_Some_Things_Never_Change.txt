Some things never change  
Hang your head  
I saw the news today o boy  
A thousand stories that we've seen before  
Small minds play at some big time games  
And everybody else pays  
Make no mistake they're on the take  
They like to keep it that way  
Some things never change  
I saw the light today o boy  
It come on flashing bright in red and blue  
The man steps in with a terminal grin  
Blue skies turn to grey  
Young men die and children cry  
Why is it always the same  
  
Life must be eaten  
Or at least bitten into  
To get past the surface  
The moment of truth  
You know when its right  
Its sweet deep inside  
Its real and its better  
That some things don't change  
  
I saw the news today o boy  
A thousand pictures of the lies we live  
Small minds play at some big time games  
And everybody else pays  
They're on the take and they don't give breaks  
They like to take it away  
Some things never change  
Hang your head
