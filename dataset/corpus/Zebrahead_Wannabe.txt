Yo, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want  
So tell me what ya want, whatcha really really want  
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, really really want is a zebrahead jam if you
want my future, forget my past  
If you wanna get with me better make it fast  
Now don't go wasting, our precious time  
Get your act together and we'll be just fine  
Chorus  
Yo, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want  
So tell me what ya want, whatcha really really want  
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, really really want is to get, get down  
If you wanna be my lover, you've gotta get with my friends  
Make it last forever, friendship never ends  
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give  
Takin is so easy, that's the way it is  
What you think about that? now you know how I feel  
Say you can handle my love, are you for real (are you for real? )  
I won't be hasty, give you a try  
If you might leave then I'll say goodbye  
Chorus  
Yo, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want  
So tell me what ya want, whatcha really really want  
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, really really want is to get, get down  
Here's a little story from z to d  
If you wanna get with me you've gotta listen carefully  
We've got toof in the house, who's hung like a mouse  
O.g. wannabes that try to hang with me  
But g don't play for free, he plays for the sensi  
And to the critics... eat me  
Slam your body down and wind it all around  
Slam your body down and wind it all around  
Chorus  
Yo, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want  
So tell me what ya want, whatcha really really want  
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, really really want is to get, get down  
Slam your body down and wind it all around  
S to the l to the a to the m  
Slam your body down with the zebrahead, yeah!
