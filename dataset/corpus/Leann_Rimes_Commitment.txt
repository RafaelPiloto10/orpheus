What I'm lookin' for  
Is a love that's forever  
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat  
And stay for all time  
What I'm prayin' for  
Is a match made in heaven  
Someone who will worship my body  
And still put his heart on the line  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
What I'm searching for  
Is a man who'll stand by me  
Who will walk through the fire  
And be my flame in the night  
I won't settle for  
Less than what I deserve  
A friend and a lover who'll love me  
For the rest of my life  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Yeah I've had promises broken  
Three words left unspoken  
They just left me achin' for more  
But I'll fight temptation  
I won't be impatient  
There's one thing that's worth waitin' for  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Way  
Commitment
