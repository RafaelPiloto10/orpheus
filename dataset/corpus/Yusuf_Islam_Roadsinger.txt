Roadsinger came to town, long cape and hat,  
People stood and stared then closed their doors, as he passed,  
He strolled the empty street, kids banged on tin cans,  
Then the panting dogs began to bark, as the roadsinger sang  
  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
When hearts are closed,  
When a friend becomes a stranger,  
Nobody wants to know  
  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
When the world turns dark,  
And the light of truth is blown out,  
And the roads are blocked  
  
He stopped by a stall, between the barrels and sacks,  
A child's face peeped out and gave a smile, and ran back,  
Behind a misty glass, on a windowpane,  
A little finger drew a perfect heart, and a name  
  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
In a world filled with fright,  
Only a song to warm you, through the night  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
After lies are told,  
And the light of truth is blown out,  
And the night is cold  
  
Roadsinger rode on, to another land,  
Though the people spoke a different tongue, it understand,  
They showed him how to share, and took him by the hand,  
Showed him the path to Heaven, through the desert sand  
  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
To find happiness,  
In a world filled with hatred, (Cheers)  
Where do you go, where do you go,  
If no one cares,  
And everybody's lost, looking for theirs
