I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night  
I was sailing on an ocean of blue  
And right there by my side, much to my surprise, was you  
  
I said, come on over baby, let me look in your eyes  
Let me see the very heart of you  
And I couldn't believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true  
  
'Cause you said, hey there sweet daddy, everything is alright  
You know for miles there's not a telephone line  
There's not a soul to disturb us  
Just come and be mine  
  
You said, let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
But now it's four in the mornin', I can't sleep  
I can't seem to get you out of my mind  
I keep tossin' and turnin', I'm yearnin' for the sun to shine  
  
I'd like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express  
And take you far away with me  
I've got a vision of heaven, you livin' there with me  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh  
Let me be the one that you love
