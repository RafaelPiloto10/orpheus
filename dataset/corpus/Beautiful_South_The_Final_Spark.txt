Well the dice that I roll never seems to land on six  
And that 48 card pack is short of some of my old tricks  
The horse I bet on all those years ago  
Is probably still running round the track  
Like the marriage that I gambled on  
I'm due my money back, I'm due my money back  
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code  
It can leave a lasting mark  
History books have showed follow safety code  
And stamp out your final spark  
Well the husband that I married once  
I should've kept him in a cage  
Kept him sitting waiting there  
To show the tortoise middle-age  
Cause you never back an animal that struggles on two legs  
I'd rather back a stray with three than one that sits up and just begs  
Than one that sits up and just begs  
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code  
It can leave a lasting mark  
History books have showed follow safety code  
And stamp out your final spark  
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code

And stamp out your final spark  
Milk will curdle, cheese go off, expensive wine mature  
Kids grow up, parents down, husbands turn to tragic bore  
Receipts and life insurance all very well, but don't fully cover hate  
So you can't return this idiot when he's past his sell-by date  
Milk will curdle, cheese go off, expensive wine mature  
Kids grow up, parents down, husbands turn to tragic bore
