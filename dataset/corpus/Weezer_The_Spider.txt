There's a spider on the drain and he's feeling pain  
And he doesn't want to die any more than you or I  
He's struggling to live but he doesn't have much time  
Any more than you or I, you or I  
  
We've got to die, we've got to live  
We got to take what we can get  
We sell ourselves for petty change  
And when we die we rearrange  
It's time to take it back again  
It's time to take it back again  
I want you to love me like I love you  
  
There's nothing more for me to say  
I spoke my piece I'll go on my way  
And fare thee well where'er you go  
You might need help but I won't know  
'Cuz I'm up in here in my own cell  
It could be heaven it could be hell  
We'll never know just who we are  
'Cuz when we die we become a star  
And stars can't talk because they have  
No mouth to speak about their past  
They simply shine up in the sky  
And give their light to you and I  
And where would we be without their light  
We'd call out names and then start a fight  
But then again that's what we do  
I hate me and I hate you too  
'Cuz I'm in pain just like the spider  
In the drain, I am a fighter  
But I can't win I've got to lose  
Give me strength to see me through  
And ease the pain that I must feel  
As my bones break and I taste the steel  
As I go down...the drain...  
I'm insane
