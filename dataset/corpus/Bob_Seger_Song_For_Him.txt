I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
When I'm lonely still I know  
He'll forgive me yes it's so  
I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
When I'm sorry I remember  
That he loves me  
And I'm better  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
It doesn't matter if I'm wrong it doesn't matter if I'm right  
He's with me at the break of dawn  
He's every star that shines at night  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
When I'm happy skies are blue  
I forget him still it's true  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
But not sorrier than Him  
But not lonelier than Him
