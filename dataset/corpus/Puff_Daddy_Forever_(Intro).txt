Tonight in la, rapper Notorious B. I. G. Was gunned down  
At the media party. He was pronounced dead on arrival.  
No suspects have been taken into custody.  
[Radio Announcer2]  
Combs' trouble seems to continue as he turned himself  
In today to local police for an alleged assault and  
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on  
His own recognizance.  
[Puff]  
In my distress I prayed to the Lord  
And the Lord answered and rescued me  
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid  
What can mere mortals do to me  
Yes the Lord is for me  
He will help me  
I will look in triumph at those who hate me  
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people  
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes  
Though hostle nations surrounded me  
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
They swarmed around me like bees  
They blazed against me like roaring flames  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
The Lord is my strength and my song  
He has become my victory  
Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do
