Born at the end of a Minnesota freeze  
Eldest child of Willy and Louise  
His little sister died at the age of four  
The family posed, led by Louise  
Like right out of some kind of Rockwell scene  
But Jake couldn't fake it anymore  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door  
Everybody loves to point their finger  
They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door  
Willy later said, "He really should've known  
The boy spent too much time on his own  
And what was on his mind, God only knew"  
One by one the neighbors went away  
A gruesome little game Jake taught himself to play  
His daddy always said, "Find something to do"  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door  
Everybody loves to point their finger  
They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door  
One less mistake to think about  
'Cause no one read the writing on the wall  
So much for case 1239  
Covered up, curled up in a ball  
One little page in the history of crime  
Lawyers made a fortune for their time  
Seems an explanation was never found  
And I hope this tale won't be misunderstood  
Things ain't the same in every neighborhood  
But before you go to sleep tonight, look around  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door  
Everybody loves to point their finger  
They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door
