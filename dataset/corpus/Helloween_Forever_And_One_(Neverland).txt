What can I do?  
Will I be getting through?  
Now that I must try  
To leave it all behind  
  
Did you see  
What you have done to me  
So hard to justify  
Slowly is passing by  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide  
Your lies, your lies  
  
Here I am  
Seeing you once again  
My mind's so far away  
My heart's so close  
to stay  
Too proud to fight  
I'm walking back into night  
Will I ever find  
Someone to believe?  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide your lies  
Your lies
