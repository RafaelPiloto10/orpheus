To touch the sky  
A dreamer must be  
Someone who has more imagination than me  
  
To reach the stars  
A dreamer must fly  
Somehow he must live more of a lifetime than I  
For sands of time won't wait  
And it may be too late  
  
Now is the hour and moment  
Don't let the chance go by  
Your ship is sailing with the high tide  
And all your dreams are on the inside  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
Looking out, looking out, looking out  
  
To change the world  
A dreamer must be  
Someone who has more determination than me  
  
To free his soul  
A dreamer must fly  
Somewhere he must find a better reason than I  
The hands of time won't wait  
And we may be too late  
  
Now is the hour and moment  
Don't let a day pass by  
Your ship is sailing with the high tide  
You could be standing on the inside  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
Looking out, looking out, looking out
