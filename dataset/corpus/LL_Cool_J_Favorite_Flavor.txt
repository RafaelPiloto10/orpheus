Uh-huh, eh-heh  
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)  
  
You only a customer  
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers  
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range  
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed  
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls  
You can taste it, my instict's basic  
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey  
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es  
All different colors of the spectrum  
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em  
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em  
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them  
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers  
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers  
These young rookies, fail to understand  
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man  
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can  
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce  
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's  
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses  
Every bite is more delicious  
My favorite flavor  
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)  
Like caramel on vanilla sundae  
Have a scoop you'll want some day  
Cause you're my favorite flavor  
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon  
  
My flavor's unreal  
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel  
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel  
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?  
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash  
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'  
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'  
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through  
Me too! Man you know how we do  
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview  
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ  
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'  
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'  
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'  
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this  
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Uh) All I wanna do  
Is eat you up 'cause you look so good  
(Think I look alright huh?)  
(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)  
All I wanna do  
Is show you boy that I taste good too  
(I know you taste good ma)  
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)  
  
We had it out  
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about  
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline  
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams  
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine  
Low calorie leave no cavities  
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be  
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ba-bee
