Verse 1:  
Years ago we met by chance  
Thinking - we? D start the greatest love of all  
Both of us were in a trance  
Together we have been so strong  
Through the years I felt a change  
Suspecting? We could not keep our love alive  
Soon it all  
Became so strange  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
  
Verse 2:  
I shy away from love these days  
  
Because? I need to be alone for now  
We have to go different ways  
Then I may understand my faults  
I? M sure that it will take some time  
Until? I open up my heart again  
It? S so dark  
The sun won? T shine  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
I? D like to set off  
And follow your track  
But I know you would never come back  
All that remains  
At the end of the show  
Are footsteps you left in the snow
