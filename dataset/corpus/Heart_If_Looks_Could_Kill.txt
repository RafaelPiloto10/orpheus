Caught you in the act, can't put up with that  
Messing where you shouldn't be  
I want to hear you say you're sorry  
Cause nobody takes advantage of me  
  
You're missing the mark, shooting in the dark  
I'm pulling the wool from my eyes  
Baby don't you push me further  
It's gonna hurt you if it happens twice  
  
If looks could kill  
You'd be lying on the floor  
You'd be begging me please please  
Baby don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
You're living on the edge, hanging by a thread  
I'm watching every move you make  
You don't want to see my anger  
So don't you make another mistake  
  
Love is on the line, I ain't about to be kind  
That's a promise and a threat  
If I was you I'd really cool it  
Or risk a night you'll never forget  
  
If looks could kill  
You'd be living on the floor  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
I was a fool to believe in you  
A sucker for every line  
I'm a little less blind  
Than I was before  
I can see right through your design  
  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin' don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin' don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
If looks could kill
