She knows all about me  
She knows all my felonies  
She got the moves to-a-make me tremble  
She's got me on my knees  
She's got life-time guarantees  
'Ain't got no time for my innuendos  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
She say I'm to blame  
She say men are all the same  
She got the signed, sealed, testimony  
She knows a woman's place  
She knows where to rest her case  
She got her mind on alimony  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Hey, baby, bring it on home to mama  
Hey, hay-makin' baby, bring it on home to mama  
She wears a heart of gold  
Says her needs are many fold  
I got no reason or need to doubt it  
She knows she leads the dance  
She knows how t'wear those pants  
She got the full metal matching outfit  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
You can go blind, gimme what's mine  
If y'wanna keep this love alive, (keep this love alive)  
Bring it on home to mama  
Don't talk back, just get another kick-back  
This ain't no jive, (this ain't no jive!)  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bring it on home, bring it on home  
Bring it on home, bring it on home  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to mama  
Bring it on home!
