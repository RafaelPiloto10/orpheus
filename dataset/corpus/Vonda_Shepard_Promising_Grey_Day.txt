Eighteen and flying  
Like every great American  
Slept until sundown  
And baby your were wild enough fro me  
Rolled the night over  
In my '72 Nova  
Mexican rain on my  
Tijuana vinyl beer stain  
Watching the sunrise  
Lightening in your lazy eyes  
And all this time you never let me down  
I had a dream  
That made me move to New York City  
?Cause I wasn't about to  
About to let this magic slip away  
But he did anyway  
He was kind of illusive that way  
Like clouds on a promising grey day  
The beauty of my life  
A moment that's long gone  
But so much a part of me  
Oh, how I wish it weren't history  
I wish it were my future  
Rolling, rolling my way  
Like clouds on a promising grey day
