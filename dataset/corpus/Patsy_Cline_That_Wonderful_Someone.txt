That wonderful someone  
Who makes the stars all shine  
Who fashioned the mountains  
To reach to the sky  
Who brings each tomorrow  
Who hears every prayer  
In sunshine or sorrow  
If you call he'll be there  
  
That wonderful someone  
Who makes the flowers grow  
Who paints every sunset  
With colors that glow  
Look all around you  
And these wonders you'll see  
Designed by that someone  
For you and for me
