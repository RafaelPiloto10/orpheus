When your imagination has too much to say  
When the chill of the night meets the sweat of the day  
And you have trouble understanding what other people have to say  
You'd better  
  
Hang on to your emotions  
  
When a demagogue inside your head has taken charge  
And by default what you say or do is criticized  
And this litany of failures is recited a thousand times  
You'd better  
  
Hang on to your emotions  
  
Could it be you've never felt like that  
That your mind's a cage - inside the cage a cat  
That spits and scratches all it can get at  
And that's you  
And your emotions  
Could it be you've never felt like that  
Your mind's a cage - inside the cage a rat  
Rabidly trying to get it  
You  
  
And your emotions  
You and your emotions  
  
When your imagination has too much to say  
When that facile voice inside your head says give your life away  
You might think to ask - how it got that way  
What books it has read - that make it that way  
And where it got the right - to speak to anyone that way  
You'd better  
  
Hold on to your emotions  
Hold on to your emotions  
  
When a night city's breeze blows across the room  
And a 5 am moon and sun start their swoon  
You hear your lover's breath  
And not a moment too soon  
You get to  
  
Release all your emotions
