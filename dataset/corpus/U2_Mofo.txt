Lookin' for to save my save my soul  
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow  
Lookin' for to fill that God shaped hole  
Mother  
Mother sucking rock and roll  
  
Holy dunc spacejunk comin' in for the splash  
White dopes on punk staring into the flash  
Lookin' for baby Jesus under the trash  
  
Mother  
Mother sucking rock and roll  
Mother  
Mother sucking rock and rock and rock and roll  
Mother  
Mother  
  
Mother am I still your son  
You know I've waited for so long to hear you say so  
Mother you left and made me someone  
Now I'm still a child  
But no one tells me no  
  
Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world  
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls  
Got the swing got the sway got my straw in lemonade  
Still looking for the face I had before the world was made  
  
Mother  
Mother sucking rock and roll  
Bubble poppin' sugar droppin' rock and roll  
Mother  
Mother  
Mother  
Mother  
Mother  
Mother  
  
Soothe me mother  
Rule me father  
Move me brother  
Woo me sister  
Rule me father  
Soothe me mother  
Show me mother  
Show me mother  
Show me mother  
Show me mother
