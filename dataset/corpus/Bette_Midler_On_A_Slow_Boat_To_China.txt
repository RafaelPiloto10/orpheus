Hey, nice piano playin', Manilla  
Thank you, Miss M  
Whatcha doin' these days?  
Makin' records  
  
Really?  
Yes, really  
Do you still play piano for people?  
Well, depends on who  
  
Hmm, I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Get you and keep you  
In my arms evermore  
Leave all the others  
Waitin' on a faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny  
Where the moon's  
Big and shiny  
Meltin' your heart of stone  
  
I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Bette, I didn't know  
You felt that way about me  
I don't, I need a piano player  
Ah, just like the old days  
You're not gonna change keys  
On me are yah? Uh huh, oh  
  
I'm gonna get you  
(You're never gonna get me)  
On a slow boat to China  
(Not in a fast or slow boat at any crick)  
All to myself alone  
(I just get motion sick)  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
(Ha, you'll have to stand in line)  
Get you and keep you  
In my band evermore  
(Now there's a new attack)  
  
Leave all the others on the shore  
(For me they'd swim to China)  
(To China and back)  
  
Out on the briny  
(I wouldn't like the ocean)  
Where the moon's big and shiny  
(Not even in a rowboat)  
  
Melting your heart of stone  
Come on what do yah say?  
(You always get your way)  
  
I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone, together  
All to myself alone
