I live my life like there's no tomorrow  
And all I've got I had to steal  
Least I don't need to beg or borrow  
Yes I'm living at a pace that kills  
Runnin' with the devil  
Runnin' with the devil  
I found the simple life ain't so simple  
When I jumped out on that road  
I got no love, no love you'd call real  
Ain't got nobody waiting at home  
Runnin' with the devil  
Runnin' with the devil  
You know I, I found the simple life, weren't so simple, no  
When I jumped out on that road  
Got no love, no love you'd call real  
Got nobody waiting at home  
Runnin' with the devil  
Runnin' with the devil  
Runnin' with the devil  
Runnin' with the devil  
[repeat and fade]
