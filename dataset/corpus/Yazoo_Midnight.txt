Midnight it's raining outside he must soaking wet  
Everyone is sleeping tight  
God knows I tried my best  
Darling you know it looks bad  
Just lost the best thing that I ever had  
Still I don't know why I did him wrong  
It's too late now he's gone to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby oh no, can't leave me now  
Said think about it please  
'cause I love you and I need you  
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong  
  
Heartache, heartache, yeah  
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down  
Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around  
I knew from the start he ain't got much money  
I should have stayed content with all that good sweet honey  
He's a good strong man and I love him so so how on earth can I let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now it's midnight it's raining outside  
And I'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine  
And I ain't found him yet  
Well all of this rain can wash away my tears  
But nothing can replace all of those wasted years  
In all of this I tell you I have learnt  
Playing with fire gets you burnt  
And I'm still burning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you'll lose your pride  
Well don't you know dear, don't you know  
I'll lose so much more if you go now  
Oh no
