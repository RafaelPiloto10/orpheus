Cool as ice yet brittle as glass  
A nervous wreck with a sweet facade  
You're breaking up  
You're breaking up now baby  
You're breaking up your life  
Into little pieces  
Baby  
  
Vanity arrived with fame  
How she loved to see her name  
She is beautiful, very beautiful  
Look at her, and she's a model  
  
Hey girl I love you but you won't listen  
To what I'm trying to say  
Things won't work out if you plan them now  
Don't throw your love away  
Give it up, baby  
Honey give it up and come back to me  
  
You know your just an able sum  
To get more money  
For them you're just a product  
For me you're the one I love  
Baby

Don't take my love away from my arms  
Oh no, I need her near me every single day  
Please don't take her away  
I need my love
