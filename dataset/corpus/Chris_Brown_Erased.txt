(Feat. Dr. Dre)  
  
You don't see me he same no more.  
It's hard to see the light.  
We're closing doors.  
Don't treat me like, like I'm invisible.  
Your tone with me is not the usual.  
We scream, we fight.  
Saying things that we both regret.  
And that's not right that you could just forget me like that.  
You never try.  
Always taking the easy route.  
Always taking the easy route.  
Never wanting to work it out.  
  
You want to be free.  
You want to leave me.  
I can't believe.  
'Cause without you, Baby, I'm incomplete.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I erased?  
Just a figment of your imagination? Yea.  
I'm feeling replaced.  
Like a faded picture where you can't see my face.  
I'm scratched out, erased.  
  
In memory of what we used to call love,  
I reminisce what used to be us.  
Remember when, when I was the most important to you?  
But now I'm a ghost.  
The trust has died.  
There's no way we can bring it back.  
We live a lie, no bars, no strings attached.  
It's in your eyes, a part of you just wants me back.  
All of me just wants you back.  
  
You wanna be free  
(You wanna be free)  
You wanna leave me  
(You wanna leave me  
I can't believe  
(I can't believe)  
  
Am I am I  
  
Chorus:  
Am I erased  
Just a figment of your imagination? Yea.  
I'm feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture  
Where you can't see me face.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I erased?  
Just a figment of your imagination? Yea.  
I'm feeling replaced, like a faded picture  
Where you can't see me face.  
  
I'm scratched out, erased X4  
  
Can anybody see me?  
See me now?  
I'm erased from the crowd.  
So cold and I don't know how.  
Find me now.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I erased?  
Just a figment of your imagination? Yea.  
I'm feeling replaced,  
Like a faded picture  
Where you can't see me face.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I erased?  
Just a figment of your imagination? Yea.  
I'm feeling replaced  
Like a faded picture  
Where you can't see me face.  
  
I'm scratched out, erased. X4
