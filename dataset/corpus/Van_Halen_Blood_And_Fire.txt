You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
I'm a lucid vision  
Of the unforgiven  
I'm your wave-toss guy  
  
King-size, we were crushin'  
Trouble by the dozen  
Stakes have never been higher  
Come back when you're younger  
'Cause I can feel the thunder  
1-800-GUITAR  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
It's a world of fools  
That's just what's expected  
None of 'em know it  
Or even suspect it  
God must love the lazy  
Shiftless and the crazy  
Puttin' so many in life  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
Forgotten empires  
Lost victories long past  
Every time I bloomed again  
I thought it was the last  
And then something crazy happens  
And boom!  
I'm doing the victory dance!  
  
Told ya I was comin' back  
(Told ya!)  
Say you missed me  
(Say it!)  
Say it like ya mean it!  
  
You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire
