Go my way and I'll be good to you  
Go my way and your dreams will all come true  
In the sunset the wild waves are callin'  
My shadow is followin' you  
Go my way and I'll take you by the hand  
Believe in me and I'll do the best I can  
I can't be anything but just what I am  
I can't help it if I'm in love with you  
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend  
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again  
Go my way it's the only way to go  
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know  
Come on along and together well go  
Please love me and say that you'll be mine  
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend  
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again  
Go my way it's the only way to go  
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know  
Come on along and together well go  
Please love me and say that you'll be mine
