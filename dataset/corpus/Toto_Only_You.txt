Waiting for you again, seems like this never ends  
I close my eyes and I see your face, and I see it all fading away  
  
Woke up before you again, you're still asleep I can't pretend  
I feel like I'm losing you, and I am trying to make everything right  
  
[Chorus]  
Only you, only me, say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you, holding my heart in your hands  
Only me, still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh  
  
If I could have a second chance, maybe change the circumstance  
Imagine if the dream came true, we could start it all over tonight  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Only me, say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you, holding my heart in your hands  
Only me, still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh
