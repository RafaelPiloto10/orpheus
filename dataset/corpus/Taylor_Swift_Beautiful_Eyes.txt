Your beautiful eyes  
Stare right into my eyes  
And sometimes I think of you late at night  
I don't know why  
I want to be somewhere where you are  
I wanna be where  
  
[Chorus]  
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine  
So baby, make me fly  
My heart has never felt this way before  
I'm looking through your  
I'm looking through your eyes  
  
I wake up, I'm alive  
In only a little while, I cry  
'Cause you're my lullaby  
So baby hold me tight cause I-I  
I want to be everything you need  
I want to be where,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as long as you're mine  
I'll be you're everything tonight  
Let me love you, kiss you  
Oh baby let me miss you  
Let me see your  
Dream about  
Dream about  
Dream about your eyes  
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes
