Possessions never meant anything to me  
I'm not crazy (Cause I got none)  
Well that's not true, I've got a bed and a guitar  
And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor  
That's right, I've got a floor  
So what, so what, so what?  
  
I've got pockets full of Kleenex and lint and holes  
Where everything important to me just seems to fall right down my leg  
And on the floor  
My closest friend linoleum  
  
Linoleum  
Supports my head, gives me something to believe  
That's me on the beach side combing the sand  
Metal meter in my hand  
Sporting a pocket full of change  
That's me on the street with a violin under my chin  
Playing with a grin, singing gibberish  
That's me on the back of the bus  
  
That's me in the cell  
That's me inside your head  
That's me inside your head  
That's me inside your head
