Oh holy night the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth, oh yeah  
Now long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth  
The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night divine  
  
Our Father, who art in heaven  
Hallowed be Thy name  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done  
On earth as it is in heaven  
  
Give us this day our daily bread  
And forgive us our trespasses  
As we forgive those who trespass against us  
Lead us not into temptation  
  
But deliver us from evil  
For thine is the kingdom  
The power, and the glory  
For ever and ever, amen  
  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
  
It was a holy, holy night  
(Oh holy night)  
It was a holy night when Jesus Christ was born  
(Oh holy night)  
Holy yes, Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
  
And the power, and the glory, yeah  
(Oh holy night)  
When Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
He was born on this night, on this night  
(Oh holy night)  
  
Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever  
(Oh holy night)
