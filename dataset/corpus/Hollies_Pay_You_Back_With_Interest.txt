Too many people need me  
I've got so much  
So much to do  
But when my traveling is over  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
It seems unfair to leave you  
And sell myself the way I do.  
But when my wandering is over  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
Most of my life I've been moving  
And when I tire out I'll come home to you.  
But until then I'll be waiting  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
How cold is my room, (How cold is my room)  
Without your love beside me?  
We look at the same old moon (Looking at the moon)  
But you're not here beside me  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest
