I asked for your number but you wanted mine,  
You said write on my hand so it's easy to find.  
We were right at the start,  
And everything was possible.  
  
We were stupid, reckless, breaking the rules,  
Careless, happy, fearless and new.  
We were right at the start, somehow we got here.  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We come so close, we got so far.  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.  
  
We were caught in a bubble, no one could burst.  
Had whole conversations without any words.  
We got right to the top  
And couldn't believe the view.  
  
It's a long way down.  
Nobody cares when it feels like flying a long way down, yeah.  
Somehow we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We've come so close, we got so far  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.  
  
To say goodbye.  
Doesn't get better  
Doesn't g-get better  
It doesn't get better than this.  
  
I was stupid, reckless, breaking the rules.  
I was foolish, hurtful, selfish and cruel.  
I was out of control but that's how we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We've come so close, we got so far  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.
