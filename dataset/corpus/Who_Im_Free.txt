Tommy:  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm free-I'm free,  
And freedom tastes of reality,  
I'm free-I'm free,  
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me.  
  
If I told you what it takes  
To reach the highest high,  
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'  
But you've been told many times before  
Messiahs pointed to the door  
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How can we follow?  
How can we follow?
