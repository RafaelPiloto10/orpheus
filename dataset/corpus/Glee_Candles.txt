Kurt: The powerlines went out, and I am all alone.  
I don't really care at all not anwsering my phone  
  
Blaine: All the games you played, the promises you made  
Couldn't finish what you started only darkness still remains  
  
All: Lost sight  
Couldn't see, when it was you and me  
  
Chorus:  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be alright  
  
Been black and blue before  
There's no need to explaine  
I am not the jaded kind  
Play back's such a waste  
You're invisible  
Invisible to me  
My wish is coming true  
Erase the memory of your face  
  
Lost sight, couldn't see  
When it was you and me  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be alright  
  
Kurt: Someday  
You will wake up  
With nothing but you're sorry  
  
Blaine: And someday  
You will get back  
Everything you gave  
All: Me  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be all right
