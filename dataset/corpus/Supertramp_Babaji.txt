All of my life I felt that you were listening  
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune  
Lord of my dreams, although confusion  
Keeps trying to deceive  
What is it that makes me believe in you?  
  
Babaji, oh won't you come to me  
Won't you help me face the music  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Help me to find it before we lose it  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And there's no one to keep you from coming here  
And there's no one to shield me before your eyes  
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?  
  
I can see it's not too good to me  
To be afloat in the sea of glory  
Babaji, oh how you comfort me  
By showing me it's a different story  
  
Your light in the dark is real  
And I know that you know it is how I feel  
When I see the reflections that's in your eyes  
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?  
  
Babaji, have you a song for me  
To tell the world of its guardian angel  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Oh must you always remain a stranger?  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And I long for delusion to disappear  
The I see the reflection that's in your eyes  
Is it time, is it time, is it time to know
