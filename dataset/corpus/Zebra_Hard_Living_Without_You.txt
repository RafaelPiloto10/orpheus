Nothing to say no place to hide  
I can't find a good reason even to lie  
All of our dreams are gone  
I may not be right but I'm surely not wrong  
And it's gonna be hard  
So very, very hard living without you  
Well don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Nowhere to go, no place to run  
We started out just having fun  
Well, I never cared too much  
Not till the going got so very rough  
And it's gonna be hard  
So very, very hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Well, don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Baby don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Well, don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Baby don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's
