Another day another reminder that your not here with me,  
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories,  
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart,  
  
Chorus  
I can hear the music playing,  
See the lights upon the tree,  
I can feel the joy in every soul,  
But for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part,  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you.  
  
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away,  
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?  
There's to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I.  
  
Chorus  
  
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!  
  
I can hear the music playing,  
See the lights upon the tree,  
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas,
without you.  
  
See I tried but it jut aint right, without you.
