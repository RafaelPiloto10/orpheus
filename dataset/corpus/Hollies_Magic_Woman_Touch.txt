I'm looking through at yesterday  
All my life thrown away  
Keep searching for the same old clue  
How can I get to you  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
I know there's been a change in me  
Ask me why I don't know  
My friends no longer speak to me  
Pass me by I don't know  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
I've made up my mind  
On what I'm gonna do  
This feeling inside  
Making it all right, making it all right  
Making it all right with me  
Break  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch  
Cast your spell upon me one more time  
I wanna feel your magic woman touch
