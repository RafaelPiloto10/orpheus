They dropped the bomb in '45 to end the world war  
No-one had ever seen such a terrible[ sight before  
The world looked on with eyes wide to see where it  
Might lead  
The politics of power, they passed around their seed  
It was a time to remember, we never can forget  
They were playin' Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian  
Roulette  
  
They arose like the saviours of our modern human race  
With radiation haloes, that hung about their face  
With the key to the sure-cure, the treatment of our  
Ills  
A hot-shot of cobalt, and a pocket-full of pills  
Speaking always of the enemy, who lurked across the  
Sea  
While they crept in among us like a carrier disease  
  
Deep down inside the bunkers of the concrete and the  
Lead  
Einstein's disciples working steadily ahead  
Making heavy metal power-plants to fire the city  
Lights  
All you can hear in the underground is the humming  
Through the night  
And the walls of tight security, circle all around  
Where they spill out their poison and bury it in the  
Ground  
  
Holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away  
  
War-heads and submarines await to make their play  
The military masterminds improve on their design  
The soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the  
Lines  
While the spills into the rivers get carried out by the  
Tide  
They call this security but we're not satisfied  
  
Our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay  
Quick to heed the hand that feeds, they're careful what  
They say  
They call out experts to assure us, to wave their magic  
Wands  
This is the power of the future, And the future marches  
On  
And they call in their favours, all their political  
Gains  
While the spills fill the rivers and settle in the  
Plains  
  
I know the minds behind them, they are riddled full of  
Holes  
Not to be trusted with their hands at the controls  
Their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their  
Careers  
The heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears  
To listen to them talk about how it hasn't happened  
Yet's  
Like playing Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette
