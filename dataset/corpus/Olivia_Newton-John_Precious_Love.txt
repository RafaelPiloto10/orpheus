In this world where life keeps changin'  
Nothin' ever seems to be enough  
I kept on, my soul was searchin'  
Lookin' for something that would fill me up  
I have always felt a yearnin'  
Somethin' inside me was unsatisfied  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
It's been sleepin' for such a long time  
This crazy feelin' I can believe in  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
  
Take our time, slow and easy  
I'm so comfortable when I'm with you  
Catch my breath when you come near me  
Can't control this if I wanted to  
Thought I'd never trust another  
But here, in your arms, I feel safe again  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
It's been sleepin' for such a long time  
This crazy feelin' I must be dreamin'  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
  
You touched a part of me  
And set my spirit free  
Precious love  
  
This crazy feelin' I must be dreamin'  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
You know your precious love has changed my life
