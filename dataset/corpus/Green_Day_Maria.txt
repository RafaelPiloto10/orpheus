She smashed the radio with the board of education  
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation  
  
Turn up the flame, step on the gas  
Burning the flag at half mast  
She's a rebel's forgotten son  
An export of the revolution  
  
She is the first voice of the last ones in line  
She'll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive  
  
Bring in the head of the government  
The dog ate the document  
Somebody shot the president  
And no one knows where Maria went?  
  
Maria, Maria, Maria,  
Where did you go?  
  
Be careful what you're offering  
Your breath lacks the conviction  
Drawing the line in the dirt  
Because the last decision  
...is no.
