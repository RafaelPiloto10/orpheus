In the sweet belly of the moment  
When you realize you've changed  
And everything you're after  
Has gone down the drain  
You're nothing more than just a drifter  
As you walk down your road  
Not exactly the picture  
You thought you'd be sending home  
All these places mean nothing  
It's the people we count on  
Here without a purpose  
Gone without a song  
  
Yesterday seemed so sudden  
Today seems to have no end  
So you button up the buttons  
Say goodbye to what has been  
Those black and white pictures  
That file through your veins  
That's the trouble with the future  
It always stays the same  
And your pride's been shaken  
And those people you count on  
Here without a purpose  
And gone without a song  
Without a song  
  
In the uncertainty of a new day  
Opportunity may howl  
You hear the voice in a new way  
In the past you didn't know how  
You're old enough to know the difference  
Between and enemy and a friend  
With the eyes of knowledge upon you  
You're able to stand up again  
Life is always in motion  
And there's new people to count on  
Here you may find a purpose  
And sing a brand new song  
  
Life is always in motion  
New people to count on  
Here we find a purpose  
To sing a brand new song  
Brand new song  
Sing a brand new song
