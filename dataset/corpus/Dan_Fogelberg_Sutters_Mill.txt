In the Spring of Forty-seven,  
So the story, it is told,  
Old John Sutter went to the mill site  
Found a piece of shining gold.  
  
Well, he took it to the city  
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.  
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd  
Left that stone in the river bed.  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman, child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.  
  
Well, they came from New York City,  
And they came from Alabam'  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land.  
  
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains.  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest.  
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty  
They had opened up the west.  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed,  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,  
He'd not one penny to his name.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill  
Some men's thirsts are never filled.
