No limits, no lines are drawn  
The whole world disappears when  
We're alone  
That thin white cotton dress is  
Blowin' in the wind  
She takes my hand and the dance begins  
  
[Chorus]  
With every move she makes  
I'm deeper than I've been  
Holding on and letting go  
She just keeps givin' in  
Takin' me higher and further  
There she goes again givin' more than  
She takes  
'Cause it's more than love she makes  
She goes all the way  
  
No questions, no talking at all  
Only the sound of our hearts as the fall  
No matter what I need, her answer's  
Always yes  
I only have to dream and she does the  
Rest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
My baby goes all the way, the way  
She goes all the way  
My baby goes all the way  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
