She tells him she thinks she needs to be free  
He tells her he doesn't understand  
She takes his hand  
She tells him nothing's working out the way they planned  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
So he's hanging on to half her heart  
He can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
  
Then he agrees he thinks she needs to be free  
Then she says she'd rather be with him  
But it's just a whim  
By which she hopes to keep him on the limb  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
So he's hanging on to half her heart  
He can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind
