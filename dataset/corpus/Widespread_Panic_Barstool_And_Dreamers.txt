The barstools built for dreamers  
We'll fit fine and find  
All the worlds dreams have died  
But tonight they're only taking thirsty people  
Who've been pullin' on their drinks  
From a glass that lies a bar length wide  
And in the drink there swim the swimmers  
And those whose swims have dried  
Take another look, take another pull  
Take another pour, take another pull  
Before you take a ride  
  
Heir to an open barstool, right there's one by "Mary the Fool"  
Mary sees the bartender's knees  
And she says that it's a bottle that she was born to be  
And I say, "that's cool.. just right, right for a fool."  
Thinkin' whiskey, she bought me a drink  
I won't cross a word of what the lady thinks  
  
Pray I don't cross what the lady thinks  
She's been thinking out too loud though  
This time I can't hear the pinball machine  
Well there's a birdman playing tiny little sideways bongos  
Pulling all those words down, down, down  
Look at how the numbers glow  
In the glass there rolls the iron ball  
And a quarter states the toll that's all (that's all)  
You take another look, take another pull  
Take another pour, take another pull  
Before you take a chance  
  
Look at your hands, they're just right for a new kinda dance  
Just forget what your bodies just done  
And ride all the waves that the drums rest on  
Like the smallest babies do, ya' know the little newborn babies do  
If there's some food that the moon feeds on  
A baby won't hold it back, won't hold it back  
  
Baby doesn't know what I just said  
Baby doesn't know the words that I just used  
Babies haven't learned any words yet  
Babies haven't been used by any words yet  
People only think, people only talk  
People only think in words they already know  
The babies haven't learned any words yet (no)  
They only know what the people feel  
They don't really care what the people think  
They only care what the people feel  
Music only knows what the people feel  
Babies only care and hear what the people feel, feel
