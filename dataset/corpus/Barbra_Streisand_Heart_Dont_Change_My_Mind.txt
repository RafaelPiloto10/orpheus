We said we'd try again but tryin' not enough  
Actin' like strangers ain't no way of making love  
It's never gonna work, its time we stopped pretending  
Time to turn the page, all stories need an ending  
It makes no sense to stay  
Living my life in yesterday  
I'm leaving, I'm leaving,  
And I'm begging you  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
Don't let me think about how good it was before  
I know you'd try anything to keep me from that door  
Its hard to leave him when you've loved him for so long now  
How can I walk away if he's still holding on now  
I've found the strength today  
Look at me I can finally say  
It's over, It's over  
So I'm begging you  
  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
It makes no sense to stay  
Sad that it has to end this way  
It's over, It's over  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go
