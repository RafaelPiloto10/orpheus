Come on baby  
  
I get so confused,  
But, my heart knows you're one of a kind  
Leather an' lace, an angels face,  
Riding on a one track mind  
You're fully loaded with cruise control,  
My four wheels rock with your back seat roll  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
I get so excited, babe, when I'm invited  
To ride in your limousine,  
You drive it every day, burn it every night,  
I wonder how you keep it so clean  
Smooth accelerator, you get me so loose,  
You keep your motor running till I run out of juice  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
Cheap an' nasty  
  
I never knew it could be this way  
An' I never thought I'd ever complain,  
But, gimme a second just to catch my breath  
Babe, before you do it again  
  
All the boys call your name  
Down the wishing well,  
Baby, when you go  
You're like a cat out of hell  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
Come on an' do the dirty,  
Come on an' do the dirty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
Come on an' do the dirty with me
