Tim Evans was a prisoner down in his prison cell  
And those who read about his crime condemned his soul  
To hell  
  
Go down you murderers go down  
  
For the killing of his own dear wife and murder of his  
Child  
The jury found him guilty and the hanging judge he  
Smiled  
  
Tim Evans walked around the yard and the screws they  
Walked behind  
He saw the sky above the wall but he knew no peace of  
Mind  
  
The screws they came to his cell and they hammered on  
His door  
Get up you dirty murderer the screws at him did roar  
  
The governor came to his cell with the chaplain by his  
Side  
Saying your appeal has been turned down prepare  
Yourself to die  
  
They took Tim Evans to the place where the hangman did  
Prepare  
They tied the rope around his neck with the knot behind  
His ear  
  
A thousand lags were screaming and banging on their  
Doors  
Tim Evans didn't hear them he was dead forever more  
  
They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he did not  
Do  
Dr. Christie was the murderer, the judge and jury too.
