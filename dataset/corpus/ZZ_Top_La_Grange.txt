Rumour spreadin' 'round  
In that Texas town  
About that shack outside La Grange  
And you know what I'm talkin' about  
Just let me know  
If you wanna go  
To that home out on the range  
They got a lot of nice girls  
  
Have mercy  
A haw, haw, haw, haw, a haw  
A haw, haw, haw  
  
Well, I hear it's fine  
If you got the time  
And the ten to get yourself in  
A hmm, hmm  
And I hear it's tight  
Most every night  
But now I might be mistaken  
Hmm, hmm, hmm  
  
Ah have mercy
