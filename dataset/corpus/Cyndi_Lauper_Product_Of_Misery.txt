She's just a product of misery...  
  
Everyday she'd go around  
Everytime I see that frown  
Broken down and down and out,  
The drudgery goes on and on.  
Oh I just want to say,  
I ain't gonna live that way 'cause  
  
She's just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that,  
Just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that.  
  
Like her mother and hers before,  
She left her heart out by the door.  
Everybody passed it by.  
They never bothered asking why  
She stayed looked up inside,  
Watching as the world turns by.  
  
Now she's just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that.  
I don't want to live like that !  
Hey, like that ?!  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery...  
  
...Annie said she must confess  
She never came and never left,  
Never could communicate and  
Now the time is much too late.  
Passions laid to rest,  
Buried with her wedding dress.  
  
Now she's just a product of misery...  
I don't want to live like that.  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery.
