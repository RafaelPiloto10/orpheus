Lord knows that I love you, why can't we get along ?  
Lord knows that I love you, why can't we get along ?  
You don't have to run around, doin' things you know is wrong  
I'll do anything in this world to please you, but I won't let you run around  
I'll do anything to please you darlin', but I won't let you run around  
Last time I held on to you, this time I might put you down  
So long, so long baby, there's no future for me and you  
So long pretty baby, no future for me and you  
I love you too much to let you run around the way you do
