To determine what you need  
Experience this feeling

Of unknowing and reveal  
All that you were dreaming  
And believe  
These communications  
Will descend on you en masse  
So what I'm saying, baby

If you feel love refused  
Believe  
In a life so defined  
You could find time  
To change your mind
