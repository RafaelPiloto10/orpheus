Sometimes when the night calls it a day  
And I wake up down in this missing you kind of way  
And I remember things better left forgotten  
And sometimes when I'm holding someone new  
I can't help myself I slip off and think of you  
And I remember things better left forgotten  
Why oh why won't my mind let go of a love that used to be  
And though I try in my heart I know your memory will never set me free  
  
And sometimes right out of the blue I hear a voice and I turn and look for you  
And I remember things better left forgotten  
  
Why oh why won't my mind let go of a love that used to be  
And though I try in my heart I know your memory will never set me free  
  
Sometimes when the nights calls it a day  
And I wake up down in this missing you kind of way I remember
