Out of the ruins, out from the wreckage  
Can't make the same mistakes this time  
We are the children, the last generation  
We are the ones they left behind  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
Looking for something we can rely on  
There's got to be something better out there.  
Mmmm, love and compassion, their day is coming  
All else are castles built in the air  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains.  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
So what do we do with our lives?  
We leave only a mark.  
Will our story shine like a light,  
Or end in the dark?  
Give it all or nothing!  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
