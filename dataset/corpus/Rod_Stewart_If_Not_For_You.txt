If not for you, babe, I couldn't find the door  
Couldn't even see the floor  
I'd be sad and blue, if not for you  
If not for you, baby, I'd lay awake all night  
Wait for the morning light to shine in through  
But it would not be new, if not for you  
If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
I'd be lost if not for you  
And you know it's true, if not for you  
If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
Oh, what would I do, if not for you? If not for you  
If not for you, winter would have no spring  
I couldn't hear the robin sing, I just wouldn't have a clue  
Anyway it wouldn't ring true, if not for you  
If not for you, if not for you, if not for you, if not for you  
If not for you, I wouldn't have a clue  
Nothing would be true, ah, if not for you, oh yeah  
If not for you, if not for you
