Come on, yeah  
I like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will rock  
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd, Run-D.M.C., and that American pimp Kid Rock  
I like Willie, Waylon, George and Merle, and a lot of ZZ Top  
I like country, soul, rock n roll, and I love me some hip hop  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
I got a bougart and west coast chopper, that sure make them bitches stare  
Got a dead flamingo wrapped around this cowboy hat I wear  
I like to cuss, yell, scream, fight and rasie all kinds of hell  
And if you ride to live, like I live to ride, then let me hear that rebel yell  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
One time for your mind, yeah  
  
I like my whiskey straight up, daiquiri's make me ill  
And if someone touches my beaver skins I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pick-up truck, I'm a four wheelin' maniac  
And if you want to race then just name the place and I'll show you where it's
at  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
And this one here, goes out to my man  
  
The legendary David Allen Coe  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey
