Oh... when you cross that line that you know you can't erase  
To fall in lust not love ain't no sin at all  
And tell me when your wit'chor best friend's friend  
Do you still feel outta place  
No thanks I took that ride  
God only knows I tried believin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
The first time you look for love  
You find you don't know jack... yeah  
So much for mind games you play to win  
'Cuz first you lose your heart's desire  
Then you get it back  
But ignorance ain't bliss  
There's so much more behind the kiss...I'm feelin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me  
God help the person...fff...who needs me...yeaah  
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list  
I'm leaving  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their hearts and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies
