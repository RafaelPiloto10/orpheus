Aw, who's the queen of the locker room  
Who's the cream of the crop  
Poor Joey took her to the matinee  
Said, "God, she wouldn't stop!"  
  
Holy muscle of love  
My heart's a muscle  
  
Well, I must have come to that crazy age  
Where ev'rything is hot  
'Cause I don't know if the things I'm thinking  
Are normal thoughts or not  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Yeah  
Ooh  
  
I read Dad's books like I did before  
Now things are crystal clear  
Lock the door in the bathroom now  
I just can't get caught in here  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
My heart's a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Must be a gift from above  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Hallelujah, etc.)
