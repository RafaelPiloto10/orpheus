(One, Two, Buckle my Shoe)  
(Do-dos, and yips yips, assorted improv)  
I tired to find How my heart could be so blind,  
(Wanna buy some Penzo?)  
Dear  
How could I be fooled just like the rest  
You came on strong with your  
Fast car and your class ring  
Sad eyes and your ... ...  
I fell for the whole thing  
I don't regret for having met  
Up with a girl who Breaks hearts  
Like they were nothing at all (Here's one for mother)  
I've done it too  
Now I know just what it feels like
