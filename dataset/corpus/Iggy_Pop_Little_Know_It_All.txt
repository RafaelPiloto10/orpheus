(feat. Sum 41)  
  
I'm the kid that no one knows,  
I live a life I never chose,  
But these thoughts in my mind,  
Are my own, my own  
  
I'm face to face with the unknown,  
My scary movie will be shown,  
I've got one evil mind,  
My own, my own  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
So...  
  
I'm a target although smart,  
They got amunition I got heart,  
I'm analyized and tagged,  
Before I start  
  
So tell me who can I respect,  
I feel the leash around my neck,  
As I find out the shame,  
In the game (in the game)  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
  
And I feel like I've crawled outside the box  
And I feel like I'm sleeping when I'm not  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
You little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry I understand,  
You'll never know it all
