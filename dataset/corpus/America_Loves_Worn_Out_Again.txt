Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But it's lost that old surprise  
Time comes and goes so quiet now  
Leaves emptiness behind our eyes  
Oh, darling, if I could spare us  
From an hour of the pain  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Winter's here, bring the blankets out  
To cover up the cold  
I'm dreamin' of the good night's sleep  
Like I used to know in days of old  
You told me you felt all alone  
But you did not tell me when  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Oh, maybe I can't see what's plainly in my view  
Oh, I wish I was a better man, maybe it's just you  
But there's something goin' on here  
Like a wound that will not mend  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again ...
