You better change your attitude  
Cause you know you want it to  
You bring me all your pride  
But I know you hold it too  
I can feed your bounty, yeah  
If you feed my head as well  
And I won't give you empty promises, yeah  
When the quarter's in the wishing well  
  
But this ain't no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now, who can you trust?  
  
You think you look so cool  
Yes you do  
You take me for your fool, yeah  
Itching' for your... Of the hug  
Baby I want a new start, but don't you be true, yeah  
I can see through your door  
You put my head into these walls  
You take my heart to the dockside, yeah  
You put me in the car  
And take me for another ride  
  
But this ain't no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now, who can you trust?  
Trust  
Trust  
  
Put a path on to your veins  
And antique and old whore's our new pain, yeah  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
You put me down  
But you can't get out of sight  
  
And this ain't no sentimental movie  
You push it on  
You grab it on  
But I don't see the tv?  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
Yeah, see the screen  
You're startin' to scream  
Abusin' confusin'  
Your program's over?  
  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
Yeah, you look so cool  
Don't take me for another one of your scenes?  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
Yea
