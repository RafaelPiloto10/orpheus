I've survived so many things  
From broken hearts to shattered dreams  
In every wall I've found an open door  
I'd miss a step, I'd learn to dance  
Come back again with half a chance  
Stronger than before  
There were times I couldn't see  
Beyond the blue inside of me  
A thousand miles away from shore  
But every moment, every day  
With every step I find my way  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles, I believe in dreams  
Through the pain I've come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrow's place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles, I believe in dreams  
Through the pain I've come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrow's place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before
