I can feel the color running  
As it's fading from my face  
Try to speak but nothings coming  
Nothing I could say to make you stay  
Grabbed your suitcase called a taxi  
It's 3am now where you gonna go?  
Gonna stay with friends in London  
And that's all I get to know  
  
Just a cigarette gone  
No you couldn't' be that far  
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are  
Maybe I can talk you down  
Maybe I can talk you down  
  
[Chorus]  
We're standing on a tiny ledge  
Before this goes over the edge  
Gonna use my heart and not my head  
And try to open up your eyes  
This is relationship suicide  
  
Cos if you go, I go  
  
Taking shortcuts through the alleys  
While your racing through my mind  
Cops can chase but they wont catch me  
Not before I get to speak my mind  
If there's still time  
  
Just a cigarette gone  
No you couldn't be that far  
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are  
Maybe I can talk you down  
Maybe I can talk you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
  
We're standing on a tiny ledge  
Before this goes over the edge  
Gonna use my heart and not my head  
  
Just a cigarette gone  
No you couldn't be that far  
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are  
Maybe I can talk you down  
Maybe I can turn around  
  
[Chorus]
