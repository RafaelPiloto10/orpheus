I never ever thought I'd live away  
From everyone I love and say goodbye  
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train  
Where everybody here, they know my game  
But when I walk down the street I hear them say  
"There she goes, that crazy girl,  
She thinks she's something in this world"  
  
So I'ma close my ears and dream  
Cause life is never really what it seems  
In every mystery, there's a truth  
You know I'm tellin, I'm tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
You can't stop me  
You're never ever gonna stop me now  
  
On every street there is a memory,  
A time and place where we can never be again  
Street lights glow green, red, and yellow too  
Do you let signs tell you what to do?  
Yeah, when you say stop,  
Be sure that I'll say go  
To the stars in the land  
  
Fire can't burn these hands  
But I just close my eyes and dream  
You can't deny me my astronomy  
  
In every mystery, there's a truth  
You know I'm tellin, I'm tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
And you can't stop me  
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now  
  
Go ahead and don't believe  
Cause everyone needs a way to dream  
And love and you can't stop me  
No you can't stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
And you can't stop me  
You're never ever ever gonna stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own
