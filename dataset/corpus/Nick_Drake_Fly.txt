Please give me a second grace  
Please give me a second face  
I've fallen far down  
The first time around  
Now I just sit on the ground in your way  
  
Now if it's time to recompense for what's done  
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun  
And the clouds will roll by  
And we'll never deny  
It's really too hard for to fly.  
  
Please tell me your second name  
Please play me your second game  
I've fallen so far  
For the people you are  
I just need your star for a day.  
  
So come, come ride in my my street-car by the bay  
For now I must know how fine you are in your way  
And the sea sure as I  
But she won't need to cry  
For it's really too hard for to fly.
