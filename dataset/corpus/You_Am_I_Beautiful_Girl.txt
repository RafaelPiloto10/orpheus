Hey you  
Put your chewing gum in my fist  
And pass the last over of your drink  
I've known you long enough to know  
Yeah I'm in deep and it shows  
I met her on grand final day  
And from sixteen thousand miles away  
Yeah I knew  
I was in trouble deep past me boots  
  
You think it's so hard  
Alone in the world  
Yeah well just try keeping up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
So I strayed (keep your head in the sky)  
Til my fingers all burnt in a sneeze (leaving nothing behind)  
And I'm holding by the skin of my teeth  
She got me grinning like a karaoke king  
Without a clue on how the thing begins  
And that's where the hell I'll reside  
In between the width of her smile  
So if you spy me just let it be  
I'm far beyond what you knew of me  
  
You think it's so hard  
Alone in the world  
Yeah well just try keeping up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
You're never alone  
It's you against the world  
You're the uninvited oyster next to the pearl  
The best lesson I learned  
  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Me, keep up with that beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl  
  
Keepin' up with a beautiful girl [Repeat x4]
