Your mind's made up  
You're gonna leave  
Nothing I can say will stop you so it seems  
But before you up and go  
There's just something you should know  
When you find that I'm the one you still need  
  
[Chorus]  
One thin dime  
Is all it takes  
When you need someone who cares  
These arms of mine  
Are always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And I'll be there  
  
Oh you're chasing rainbows and I understand  
When you're through I'll take you back again  
I'll be waiting patiently  
For when you come back to me  
Ain't nobody else can love you like I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know the number  
I'm always home  
So honey just pick up and dial that telephone  
When this world treats you unkind  
Get your momma on the line  
There ain't no need for you to ever be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These arms of mine  
Oh they're always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And I'll be there
