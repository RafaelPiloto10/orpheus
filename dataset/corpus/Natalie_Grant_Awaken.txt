Sometimes I feel like I'm just existin'  
I'm not really livin'  
I'm only watchin' the time slip away  
I've forgotten who I am in You  
I'm not who I'm meant to be, no  
I'm driftin' farther away from my destiny  
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul  
Awaken Your power and take control  
Awaken the passion to live for You, Lord  
Awaken me, oh yeah  
My soul is longin', my heart is searchin'  
I'm desperate for You to move  
Give me a hunger, pull me closer  
I'm cryin' out to You  
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul  
Awaken Your power and take control  
Awaken the passion to live for You  
I wanna live for you  
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul  
Awaken Your power and take control  
Awaken the passion to live for You, Lord  
Open my eyes so I can see  
Your presence dwelling inside  
Wake me up, 'cause I can't live  
Another minute if I'm not shining your light  
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul  
Awaken the passion in me, oh yeah  
Awaken me  
Lord, awaken me to live my destiny  
Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me  
Lord, awaken me to live my destiny  
Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me  
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul  
(Lord, awaken me to live my destiny)  
Awaken Your power and take control  
(Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me)  
Awaken the passion to live for You  
(Lord, awaken me to live my destiny)  
To live for You, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me)  
Wake me up, Lord, yeah  
Give me your passion, Jesus  
I wanna live for you
