Feel like I'm crawling on my belly  
Longing and glad...  
Excited at prospects,  
Humbled and mad  
Needy as a baby...  
I just need a helpin' hand...  
Hold me like a cradle  
With a touch you might understand...  
I'm searchin'...  
I'm searchin'...  
  
There I go jumping out of my skin.  
Wound a little right.  
Have to throw these covers down  
To get some sleep tonight.  
Tuck my heart in your pocket.  
My dreams are insecure.  
I could drink you to the marrow  
And still cry out for more  
'Cause I'm searching...  
I'm searching...  
And sometimes I feel like I'm just flying blind...  
And I can't help myself...  
And I can't stop myself...
