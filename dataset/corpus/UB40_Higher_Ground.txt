And every hour of every day I'm learning more  
The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around  
Digging deep for clues on higher ground  
  
Moon and stars sit way up high  
Earth and trees beneath them lie  
The wind blows fragrant lullaby  
To cool the night for you and I  
On the wing the birds fly free  
Leviathan tames angry sea  
The flower waits for honeybee  
The sunrise wakes new life in me  
  
And every hour of every day I'm learning more  
The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around  
Digging deep for clues on higher ground  
  
The fishes swim while rivers run  
Through fields to feast my eyes upon  
Intoxicated drinking from  
The loving cup of burning sun  
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste  
Of whispered rain on weary face  
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace  
Another time another place  
  
And every hour of everyday I'm learning more  
The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around  
Digging deep for clues on higher ground
