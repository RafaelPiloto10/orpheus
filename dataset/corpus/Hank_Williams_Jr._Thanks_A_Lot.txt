Thanks, thanks a lot, I've got a broken heart, that's all I got.  
You made me cry, and I cried a lot.  
I just wanted your love, baby thanks a lot.  
You told my friends as I was passin' by,  
That you're not sorry that you made me cry.  
You said I deserved everything that I got,  
Well if that's how you feel, honey thanks a lot.  
Yeah thanks, thanks a lot,  
  
I've got a broken heart, that's all I got.  
You made me cry, and I cried a lot.  
I just wanted your love, so baby thanks a lot.  
You ordered a fool, and I played the part,  
Now all I've got is a broken heart.  
We loved a little and you laughed a lot,  
And then you were gone. honey thanks a lot.
