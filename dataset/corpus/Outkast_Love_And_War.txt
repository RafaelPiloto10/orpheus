[Chorus:]  
let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?  
Let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?  
  
[Verse:]  
tonight we'll make the prettiest sound, that know one will  
ever hear, know one will ever hear, know one will ever...  
  
These ain't the times to be alone, cliche' the end is near  
cliche' the end is near cliche' the end is quickly  
Approaching why don't we carry on? No one is  
Promised another day. Why can't the story end like fairy  
tales often do? Before I let you leave I got to say.  
  
[Chorus:]  
let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?  
Let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?  
  
(Musical interlude)  
  
[Chorus:]  
let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?  
Let's kiss, not fight. Try to do what's right tonight.  
Make love, not war. What the hell are we living for?
