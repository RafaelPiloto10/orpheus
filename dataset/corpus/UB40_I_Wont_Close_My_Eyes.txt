I won't close my eyes  
To the sufferers plight.  
In a world full of sadness  
I won't turn off my light.  
  
Our cries for justice are shots in the dark  
But our strength's in our bite  
And not in our bark  
It's time to stand  
And shout it out loud  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound.  
  
I won't close my eyes  
When I know that I'm right  
When I'm drowning in tears  
I won't turn off my light.  
  
We're shown no respect  
But that can't break our pride,  
When our backs to the wall  
We won't run and we won't hide  
It's time to stand, face the oncoming crowd  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound.  
  
I won't close my eyes  
When the future don't look bright  
Though the road seems too long  
I won't turn off my light  
In a world full of darkness,  
I won't turn off my light.
