Somewhere in the night  
There's a heart that beats so fast  
I can feel the heat  
Of the fire in your eyes,  
Burning like a naked flame,  
Waiting for the ice to break,  
Counting down the days,  
Waiting for the weekend  
Lonely is the night.  
Silence is a friend to walk with,  
With no one else to talk to.  
  
But, on a Friday night,  
It's alright, it's alright.  
You can be who you want to be.  
Take off for the weekend.  
If you can dance you can dance with me  
'cause it's Friday night.  
  
It's alright, it's alright.  
Nothing's gonna stop me now.  
I'm all wired up and ready to go,  
I'm on my way.  
Let's get on with the show  
  
Here comes the weekend.  
Here comes the weekend.  
  
Somewhere in the heat  
There's a heart that beats so fast  
I can hear your voice:  
Talk to me tonight.  
Taking a different face  
Every time I hear your name.  
I'm counting down the days  
Waiting for the weekend  
  
Lonely is the night  
When all are sleeping.  
Silence is a friend you walk with,  
With no one else to talk to  
  
But, on a Friday night,  
It's alright, it's alright.  
You can be who you want to be.  
Take off for the weekend.  
If you dance you can dance with me  
'cause it's Friday night.  
It's alright, it's alright.  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me now,  
I'm all wired up and ready to go  
And I'm on my way.  
It's the weekend  
And it's starting today.  
  
Here comes the weekend.  
Here comes the weekend.
