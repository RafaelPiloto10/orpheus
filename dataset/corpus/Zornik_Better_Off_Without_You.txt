Am I dreaming  
People are passing the loneliness  
Am I different  
Who's to blame for all of this  
Do you think I don't exist  
Cause there comes the pain  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
And I'm better off when I'm on my own  
It seems to me that I have been  
A fool for all I said to you (2x)  
Am I dreaming  
Where it's freedom for all of us, oh yeah  
How love kills the pain  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
And I'm better off when I'm on my own  
It seems to me that I have been  
A fool for all I said to you (4x)
