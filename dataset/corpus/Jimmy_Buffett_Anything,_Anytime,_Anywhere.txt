Tomorrow may come, it usually does  
Don't know what it will bring to the two of us  
I just want you to know  
What I'm ready to do  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
  
When I'm holding you tight, you give me the power  
To burn like a torch in the darkest hour  
Tell me what you need  
I will surely come through  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
  
Passion runs deep, it's scary sometimes  
When it's larger than life or your peace of mind  
It's got me all the same  
And I'm not sorry that's true  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you
