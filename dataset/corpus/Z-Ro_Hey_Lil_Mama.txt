Hey there little mama  
Why don't you come and take a ride with me  
Around the tooooo-own  
On the low, we could be going dooo-own baby  
Hey there little mama  
Why don't you come and take a ride with me  
We could smoke us a poooo-ound  
Hit the Telly, and can and gon cloooo-own baby  
[Z-Ro]  
Well uh excuse me miss, I don't want to take up your time  
And this ain't none of that kitty game, with the same old pick up line  
I'ma get straight to the point, you are as lovely as a rose  
Though I'm not into one night stands, I'm eager to see you out your clothes  
Please don't take it the wrong way, I'm just spectating  
But I won't lie, and say I'm not thinking about sex making  
It was on my mind real strong, but I don't want to rush  
We can remain friends, for a real long time  
By then I'd know, if I've been dealing with a strong mind  
Either business brain, the drugged up and gone mind  
But that's irrelevant, I'm speaking for the present baby  
Tell your girls you gon holla, jump in my Intrepid baby  
Unless they want to come, and kick it with my homies  
If not, me and you could kick it and leave em all lonely  
I got a lot of women on my phone, trying to lay with me  
But just for tonight, I want yourself to come and stay with me

Papa was a rolling stone, and he still rolling  
I guess that's why, I leave a lot of pussy holes swollen  
I must of got it from my dad, this macking in me  
Plus all the ladies, love this big dick I'm packing with me  
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hit and run, anytime  
You make time for me, then you can come and sit and give me some  
Trying to handcuff me, you moving too quick  
Not trying to be seen in public with you, at the movies and shit  
Chances are you got a man, he gon be mad if he see you  
So let's keep our thing undercover, so nobody know what we do  
Long as we do it like that, we can do it long  
Make it a while since we did it last, so we do it strong  
It's in my blood, to be as straight up as I can be  
And straight up I can see you in my jacuzzi, chilling with me  
Though I got a lot of women on my phone, trying to lay with me  
Just for tonight, I want yourself to come and stay with me  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I feel my cell phone vibrate, I wonder who could it be  
Another bad ass yellow bone, talking dirty to me  
She say she ready for me, to come and make my round  
Telling me how she gon do me, I'm ready to break right now  
As soon as I got in my ride, 'fore I made it out the driveway  
The twins hit my celly, said that they were coming my way  
Double the pleasure double the fun, I can't miss that  
A menage with the Asian persuasion, I had to hit that  
Making money all day long, is what I love  
But I'm trying to give up a minute or two, so you can fuck a thug  
And I won't waste your time, not a minute man  
Laying pipe with long jevity, always I'll be in it man  
And once I reach my conclusion, that ain't the end  
I'm just giving you a breather, baby go on and catch a wind  
Maybe that's the reason, all these women want to lay with me  
I'll show you if you want me to, just spend the night and play with me
