Ah is there room for both of us? Both of us apart?  
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got?  
I get the words and then I get to thinkin'  
But I don't want to think I want to feel!  
How do I feel? And how do I...  
If you're the only one well I'll never be enough yeah...  
Hail hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah...  
A how I love you till the day I die...ah and beyond...  
Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come?  
It's egg rollin' thick and heavy...all the past we carry...  
Oh, I could be new...you underestimate me...  
If you're the only one, well I'll never be enough, yeah...  
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah...  
I sometimes realize...I could only be as good as you'll let me...  
Are you woman enough to be my man? Bandaged hand in hand...  
Yeah...  
I find it on my run in a race that can't be won, yeah...  
All hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah...  
If you're my only one...so good, you only one...  
I want to be your one...enough, you won...your one...your hun...
