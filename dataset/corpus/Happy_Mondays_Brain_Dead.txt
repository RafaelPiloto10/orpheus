You're rendering that scaffolding dangerous?  
  
Grass eyed,  
Slashed eyed,  
Brain dead fucker.  
Rips off town,  
Steals from his brother,  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother.  
  
It not the hip or the ship  
That gets you caught,  
No one likes to feel that they've been bought  
Why then?  
Should you do it again and again and again.  
  
He's a wise guy, when guy  
Don't like my eye spy  
Always a snipe try  
Never a green guy  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother  
  
Give you a calls  
For the  
Thing upstairs  
She brings him his night time brown and flask  
Sews up his nighttime brown and mask  
You bleed in my eye  
You bleed in my eye  
White track  
  
Grass sliding, slasher  
Brain dead fucker  
Rips of himself and steals from his brother  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother  
  
(kiss kiss)  
  
Why then should you do it again and again and again.  
Why then do you do it again and again and again.
