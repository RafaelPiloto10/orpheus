Times were so tough, but not as tough as they are now,  
We were so close and nothing came between us, and the world,  
No personal situations.  
Thick as thieves us, wed stick together for all time,  
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while,  
We stole, the friendship that bound us together  
  
We stole from the schools and their libraries,  
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep,  
We stole from the drink that made us sick,  
We stole anything that we couldn't keep,  
And it was enough, we didn't have to spoil anything,  
And always be as thick as thieves.  
  
Like a perfect stranger, you came into my life,  
Then like the perfect lone ranger, you rode away, rode away,  
Rode away, rode away.  
  
We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers,  
We stole autumn leaves and summer showers,  
We stole the silent wind that says you are free,  
We stole everything that we could see,  
But it wasn't enough, and now we've gone and spoiled everything,  
Now were no longer as thick as thieves.  
  
You came into my life,  
Then like a perfect stranger you walked away, walked away,  
Walked away, walked away.  
  
Thick as thieves us, wed stick together for all time,  
And we meant it but it turns out just for awhile,  
We stole the friendship that bound us together.  
  
We stole the burning sun in the open sky,  
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night,  
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe,  
We stole everything that we could see.  
  
But something came along that changes our minds,  
I don't know what and I don't know why,  
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time,  
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind.  
  
No, were no longer as thick as thieves, no,  
Were not as thick as
