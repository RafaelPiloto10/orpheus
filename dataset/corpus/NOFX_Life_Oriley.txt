I sit in my easy chair  
I've got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
I'll have my lion's share  
There's nothing that I like better  
Than getting something for nothing  
Some will tell you that nothing's for free  
Obviously they've not met me  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life, the life O'Riley  
You can have your cake and eat it too  
And there's lots of free lunch for you  
You think you're being cheated, you don't have a clue  
You don't know what to do  
I sit in my easy chair  
I've got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
I'll have my lion's share  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life, the life O'Riley  
Jump in, jump in
