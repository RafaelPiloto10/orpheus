Tina lives in Berlin  
Her voice so seldom  
On my machine  
Is here tonight  
And I'm on the market  
And when I'm on a market  
Words move faster  
Wire and clouds move  
Thin between us  
Like a skin  
Like a salty skin  
For a seed  
A fat circles  
A smiling smiling  
Her voice so intentionally  
Smiling  
And a cloud between us  
And these are my intentions  
Pushing [Repeat x7]  
Push  
Ah [Repeat x10]  
? the blonde  
Is carrying something  
Is carrying me  
And someone I used to be  
Great plastic someone  
Blue plastic girl  
Your dream is  
Pushing [Repeat x5]  
Pushed away your body is  
Pushing [Repeat x3]  
Pushed away your  
Come me for the unbelieve  
Carry on song  
Lipstick fodder  
The boyfriend blond  
Between the holes of sheets  
Is professionally poised  
Faces watching her  
She's watching the faces  
Watching her  
Pushin [Repeat x3]  
Push  
Pushing [Repeat x3]  
Love [Repeat x5]  
Ha  
Pushing [Repeat x3]  
Push  
Push  
Pushing [Repeat x3]  
Love [Repeat x9]  
Ha [Repeat x10]
