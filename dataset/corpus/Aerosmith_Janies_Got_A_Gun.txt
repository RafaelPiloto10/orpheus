Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done  
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun  
Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done  
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound, it's the sound...  
Nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...  
Nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her whole world's come undone  
From lookin' straight at the sun  
  
What did her daddy do  
What did he put you through  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man, he had it comin'  
Now that Janie's got a gun  
She ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now it's untrue  
What did her daddy do  
He jacked the little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightnin' and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the pain  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do  
It's Janie's last I.O.U.  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said 'cause nobody believes me  
The man was such a sleaze  
He ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Everybody is on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
  
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey what's your problem)  
'Cause Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)  
Janie's got a gun (Was it daddy's cradle robbin')  
Her dog day's just begun (That made you scream at night)  
Now everybody's on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun
