Everybody's looking at me, feeling paranoid inside  
When I step outside I feel free, think I'll find a place to hide  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be  
Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see  
So tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
So I'm telling all you people, listen while I sing again  
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizophren  
So tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?
