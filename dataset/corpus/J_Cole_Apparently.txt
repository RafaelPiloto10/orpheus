[Intro]  
Oh right, oh  
Oh why  
Na-da-da-da  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my canvas  
I'mma paint it how I want it baby, oh I  
This is my canvas  
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong, only a song  
I like to write alone, be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home  
But the only thing like home I've ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome  
Had no clue what you was goin' through  
How could you be so strong?  
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together  
(I love you mama)  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me  
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it  
  
[Verse 2]  
Another day another rhyme ho  
Another day another time zone  
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right  
I got two bitches playin' on my trombone  
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me  
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies  
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these  
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga  
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga  
Uh, couldn't resist  
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed  
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon  
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch  
Like thanks for the view  
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist  
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget  
Cole is your phone on zero percent  
Going off, now niggas showin' off  
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft  
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing  
Gettin' head like a coin toss  
Too easy  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me  
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it
