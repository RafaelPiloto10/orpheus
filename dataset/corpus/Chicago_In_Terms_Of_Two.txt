You played the part of Miss Hard-to-get  
And somehow you knew that I couldn't forget  
And though I don't think in terms of two  
I got it bad for you  
And when you passed me along the way  
I couldn't speak  
So you didn't stay  
And though I don't think in terms of two  
You're breaking my heart  
Shaking me all apart  
Breaking my heart  
Shaking me all apart again  
When it appeared to me I was down  
And nothing I did could bring me around  
And though I don't think in terms of two  
I saw it there in you  
So now if you'd only understand  
That without you here  
I'd be half of a man  
And though I don't think in terms of two  
You're breaking my heart  
Shakin' me all apart  
Breaking my heart  
Shakin' me all apart again  
Because of you  
Because of me  
The time's not right  
I disagree  
Before you leave  
I want you to see  
Woah, what you've done to me
