Life never seems to get you down  
You always seem so full of fun  
Never feel alone  
Don't need anyone  
I always have to think of you  
I need to know how much you care  
Wonder where you are  
I always need you here  
Don't say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Don't tell me lies  
'Cause I can see they're not true  
Don't say you'll stay  
If you are going to leave me  
Don't speak of love  
'Cause you know I'll always love you  
You think I'd make your life my own  
You think I'd stop you being free  
Try to tie you down  
And make you stay with me  
I only want you as you are  
I'd never stop you being you  
Don't want you to change  
All I want is you  
Don't say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Don't tell me lies  
'Cause I can see they're not true  
Don't say you'll stay if you  
If you are going to leave me  
Don't speak of love  
'Cause I know I'll always love you  
Don't say you'll care  
If you are going to hurt me
