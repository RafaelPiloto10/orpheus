All you seem to do want to do  
Is break my heart  
Seems to me  
We're a lot better off apart  
Time was when you took  
A pride in puttin' me down  
We'll I've some news for you  
That's gonna turn ya around  
  
I got no time for no crazy lady  
And the games you want to play  
'Cause a love like mine's  
Gonna take some time  
You can't save it for a rainy day  
  
Well, l do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know what  
I'm trying to say  
Love's not a game  
It's never the same  
You gotta live your love  
From day to day  
  
Lonely days are long and  
Sad nights are so black  
Then I get right down thinkin'  
Maybe I could take you back  
Till at mornin' light  
A new face appears at my door  
As a kinda reminder that  
I ain't seein' you no more
