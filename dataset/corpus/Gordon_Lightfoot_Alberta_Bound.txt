Oh the prairie lights are burnin' bright  
The Chinook wind is a-movin' in  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
Though I've done the best I could  
My old luck ain't been so good and  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
No one-eyed man could e'er forget  
The Rocky Mountain sunset  
It's a pleasure just to be Alberta bound  
I long to see my next of kin  
To know what kind of shape they're in  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
  
Oh the skyline of Toronto  
Is somethin' you'll get onto  
But they say you've got to live there for a while  
And if you got the money  
You can get yourself a honey  
A written guarantee ta make you smile  
But it's snowin' in the city  
And the streets and brown and gritty  
And I know there's pretty girls all over town  
But they never seem ta find me  
And the one I left behind me  
Is the reason that I'll be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound
