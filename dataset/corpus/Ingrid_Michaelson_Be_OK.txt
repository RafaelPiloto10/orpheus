I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
  
[Chorus]  
Open me up and you will see  
I'm a gallery of broken hearts  
I'm beyond repair, let me be  
And give me back my broken parts  
  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
I just want to know something today  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just give me back my pieces  
Just give them back to me please  
Just give me back my pieces  
And let me hold my broken parts  
  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay
