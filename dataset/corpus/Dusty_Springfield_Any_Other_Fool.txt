I couldn't see paradise right before my eyes  
When I had you here by my side  
I didn't know that no one else  
Could ever take your place  
But, now I know  
I know that I should have stayed  
And seeing you tonight  
I only wonder why I ever said, goodbye  
Any other fool would never walk away  
Even a fool would still be there holding you  
Any other fool would know I never  
Should have let you go  
I had it all as any fool could see  
Any other fool but me, oh, ahh, oh  
Anyone else never would have let the feeling die  
Anyone else would have fought to keep it alive  
If they were in my shoes, they'd know the love we had  
Was love too good to lose  
Any other fool would never walk away  
Even a fool would still be there holding you  
Oh, any other fool would know  
I never should have let you go  
I had it all when you were loving me  
I had it all as any fool could see  
Any other fool but me, oh, oh, oh  
I had it all when you were loving me  
I had it all as any fool could see  
Any other fool but me  
Any other fool would never walk away  
Even a fool would still be there holding you  
Oh, any other fool would know  
Never should have let you go  
Had it all as any fool could see  
Any other fool but me  
Oh, oh, oh  
Even a fool would still be there holding you  
Any other fool would know  
I never should have let you go  
I had it all as any fool could see
