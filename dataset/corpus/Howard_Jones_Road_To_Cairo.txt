A fella told me  
This here road leads to Cairo  
I got to get me a ride  
I got to go back  
Go back to my children  
I got to see my little bride  
  
I been travellin'  
Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'll find  
Scared of what I'll find  
But I just got to see them again  
  
Hey thanks for stoppin'  
Are you headed down to Cairo?  
I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo  
Why to little old Cairo?  
No special reason  
Look up some folks I used to know  
  
Me I travel some  
Have my share of fun  
Now that's a life a man can live  
Sure I've played and lost  
But who minds the cost  
You got to take more than you give  
  
Hey you got another cigar?  
Son I sure like this car  
Oh from your daddy as a gift  
Say on second thought  
There's gifts I haven't bought  
Just drop me here  
Thanks for the lift  
  
Yes I've travelled some  
Yes I've been a bum  
Never have a dime for gin  
Left to make my way  
Told her I can't stay  
To see my children poor as sin  
  
I know this road  
It leads straight into Cairo  
Twenty-two miles straight ahead  
I can't I can't walk down this road to Cairo  
They're better thinkin' I'm dead  
  
I been travellin'  
Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'd find  
Scared of what I'd find  
I can't I just can't walk down this road
