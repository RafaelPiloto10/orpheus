[Hook]  
Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin'  
With the top down  
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin'  
Watch it go down  
Get in my trunk and I'll be ridin'  
With my top down  
With my top down  
My top down  
  
[Verse 1]  
From a small town  
Cruisin' thru the big city  
Where the fellas are cute  
And the girls are pretty  
It's our world so you know  
It's going down  
I ain't got a lotta money  
But I got a lotta style  
What what  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Chorus]  
Electric city  
Baby, you're mine tonight  
Electric city  
Don't you shine bright  
Electric city  
Baby, you light the way  
Electric city  
I think that I might stay  
  
[Verse 2]  
Passed out real  
And I woke up realer  
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
Me and my clique  
Goin' hard and you feel us  
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
Come on let me take you for a ride  
I ain't got a lotta money  
But I got a lotta style  
What what  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Chorus] x2
