Get ready for the lady  
She's gonna be a treat  
Simmer slightly 'til ready  
Make her soft too  
Make her sweet  
  
I kiss the tears off from your chest  
I felt the poison fright that's in your breath  
I knew your precious life and I know your death  
I squeeze the love out of your soul  
All the perfect love that's in your soul  
You're just another spirit on parole  
  
Devil's food  
Devil's food  
Devil's food
