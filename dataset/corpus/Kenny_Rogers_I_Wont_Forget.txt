It might've been a Saturday night  
It ain't clear it was so long ago  
It was somewhere across the county line  
A dance or a party I don't know  
But I do know you looked like an angel  
And your eyes were the color of your dress.  
  
There's a million things I don't remember  
But that's the one thing that I won't forget.  
  
It might've been a Saturday night  
It was either my folks car or yours  
I know that we went to some drive-in  
What was playing that night I'm not sure  
But I am sure you whispered you loved me  
As my lips softly pressed against your neck.  
  
There's a million ...  
  
After a while I guess we agreed  
We had wings we needed to test  
Somehow we talked ourselves out of love  
That such close to love as I've gotten yet.  
  
It was 2:21 on a Sunday  
And I found myself standing in the rain  
You blew me a kiss through the window  
As your greyhound was pulling away  
Inside I was dying to stop you  
I should've listened to my heart  
And not my head.
