Whatever you want me to do I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be I will be what you need  
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near  
I'm feeling sensual  
I can't rely on myself, I'm wanting you and no one else  
You've got me wrapped up  
Cause times takes what love heals  
Wherever you are I know it's for real  
  
Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need  
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near  
I'm feeling sensual  
And I, I know that it's real  
  
I know you've had pains in your heart, that have torn you apart  
I know you've been safe on your own, but together we're strong  
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're holding me  
I'm feeeling passionate  
And I can't deny it in myself, I'm wanting you and no one else  
You've got the power  
Cause love takes what time steals  
And deeep in my heart I know that it's real  
  
Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need  
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're next to me  
I'm feeling sensual  
I know (know), I know (I know) that it's real  
  
Cause times takes and love heals  
Wherever you are I know it's for real  
I know, I know that it's real  
  
Whatever you want me to do baby, baby, baby  
I will do, darling, do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be, yeah  
I will be everything  
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near  
I'm feeling sexual  
It's time that I breathe for the love that pleases me  
Too easily, easily, baby
