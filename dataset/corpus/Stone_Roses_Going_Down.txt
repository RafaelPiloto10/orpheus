Dawn sings in the garden  
Phone sings in the hall  
This boy's dead from two day's life  
Resurrected by the call  
Penny here we've got to come  
So come on round to me  
There's so much penny lying here  
To touch, taste and tease  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming round  
Penny's place her crummy room  
Her dansette crackles to Jimi's tune  
I don't care I taste Ambre Solaire  
Her neck her thighs her lips her hair  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
Yeah she looks like a painting  
Jackson Pollock's Number Five  
Come into the forest and taste the trees  
The sun starts shining and I'm hard to please  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
To look down on the clouds  
You don't need to fly  
I've never flown in a plane  
I'll live until I die
