How insensitive  
I must have seen  
When she told me that she loved me  
How unmoved and cold  
I must have seen  
When she told me so sincerely  
Why, she must have asked,  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?  
  
What was I to do?  
What can you do  
When a love affair is over?  
  
So now she's gone away  
And I'm alone  
With the memory of her last look  
Vague, and drawn and sad  
I see it still  
All the heartache in that last look  
Why, she must have asked,  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?  
  
What was I to say?  
What can you say  
When a love affair is over?
