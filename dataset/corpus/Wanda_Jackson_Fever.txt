Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
[Chorus: ]  
You give me fever, fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever, in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is somethin' you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said "Juliet, baby you're my flame"  
Thou giveth fever when we kisseth fever with the flaming youth  
fever, I'm on fire, fever you have burnt forsoothe"  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said "Daddy oh don't you dare  
He gives me fever, with his kisses fever when he holds me tight  
Fever I'm his Mrs, daddy won't you treat him right"  
  
Now you listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
We give you fever when you kiss 'em fever when you live and learn  
Fever, till you sizzle what a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn
