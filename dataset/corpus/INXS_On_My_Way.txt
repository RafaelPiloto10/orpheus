Shake make it forever  
Curling from you lips  
Faith and it's not over  
Bring on that famous word  
  
Love don't abuse it  
And you'll never be sad again  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Blood's getting hotter  
Thinking about your hips  
I feel all the hunger  
The minute you turn away  
  
I think it's getting better  
But I can't wait another day  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Make all your wishes  
No sooner said than done  
Here I come like I told you  
Whether it's air, land or sea  
  
She said this is the real thing  
'Cause your never gonna find the door  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Love don't abuse it  
And you'll never be sad again  
  
I'm on my way  
[repeat till end]
