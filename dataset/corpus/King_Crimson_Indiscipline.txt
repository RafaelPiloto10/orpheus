I do remember one thing.  
It took hours and hours but..  
By the time I was done with it,  
I was so involved, I didn't know what to think.  
  
I carried it around with me for days and days..  
Playing little games  
Like not looking at it for a whole day  
And then... looking at it.  
  
To see if I still liked it.  
I did.  
  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
  
I repeat...  
The more I look at it,  
The more I like it.  
I do think it's good.  
  
The fact is..  
No matter how closely I study it,  
No matter how I take it apart,  
No matter how I break it down,  
  
It remains consistent.  
I wish you were here to see it.  
  
I like it.
