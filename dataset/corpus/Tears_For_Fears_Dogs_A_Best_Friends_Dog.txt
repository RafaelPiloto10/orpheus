Shame  
Dog shame  
I know what's wrong  
Man's too old and wise  
Bring in the dog  
Turn on  
Down the mountain rescue  
Slip and slide when sunny  
Small cat better move along  
Or this bitch could do harm, baby  
Straight as an arrow  
I'm walking the dog  
  
Three is a crowd  
Two is a dog and me playing  
(What's he saying)  
Free as a cloud  
No one ever really knew you  
Make clear your illusion no, no, no, no  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ you're coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
  
Word, speech, blurred, bleached  
Tell Mr Godot I'm walking the dog  
Walking the dog  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ you're coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
Dog's a best friend's dog
