They say that some people never grow up  
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love  
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams  
If life is real then so is my imagination  
All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?  
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?  
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back  
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain  
They say you can never go back  
What if my love's still the same?  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same  
When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on  
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong  
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on  
And on, and on it goes  
I can't pretend imaginary friends are better  
All I know is people change, people change, people change  
They say I'm supposed to forget and go on  
What if my love's still the same? Still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
(Oh, baby, now)  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same
