In this wasteland without any shadows  
There is no water for my dusty throat  
There is no rainbow days filled with silent sorrow  
And for our sins there are no antidotes.  
Eternal sand  
There is no end to his no man's land  
We all must pay  
For the piper we dance while he plays  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many years must I carry on.  
In this our endless searching for the Holy Grail  
There is no sleep for the souls who find no rest  
Ships of the desert without rigs or sails  
Flotsam and Jetsam floating from the west  
Eternal sand  
There is no end to his no man's land  
We all must pay  
For the piper we dance while he plays  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many years must I carry on
