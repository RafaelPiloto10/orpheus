All the animals in the world  
Who's going to rescue them  
Who says that Noah is going to  
Come around once again  
I'll swim, I'll swim, I'll swim  
And I'll never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream  
Love was just a dream  
All the animals in the world  
What have we done to them  
Who's going to tell our children  
Where and why they're all gone  
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run  
And I'll never stop until I get  
To be free  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream  
Love was just a dream  
Stop killing, stop killing, stop killing animals  
Stop killing, stop killing, stop killing animals  
I can't take no more  
I'm drifting to the shore  
I can't take no more  
I'm knocking on your door  
I'll swim, I'll swim, I'll swim  
And I'll never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
I need you now, need you now
