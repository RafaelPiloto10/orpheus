I have a woman inside my soul,  
Her eyes sombre and sad.  
She waves her hand to try to reach me,  
But I can't hear what she says.  
  
I wish I knew what she says,  
I wish I knew what she wants,  
I wish I knew what she says to me,  
I wish I knew what she means to me.  
  
I see an asphalt road inside my soul,  
It's pale even in a warm summer's day.  
It stretches into the mist and calls me,  
But I don't know what it takes.  
  
I wish I knew what it takes, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it gives, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says to me, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
I see a tombstone inside my soul,  
It's old and mossy, covered in dead leaves.  
It stands with an engraving on it surface,  
But I don't know what it reads.  
  
I wish I knew what it reads, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says to me, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey)  
  
I feel snow covering inside my soul,  
It's hard and shining in shades of grey.  
No footsteps ever made their marks,  
And I don't know when it melts.  
  
I wish I knew when it melts, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew when it happens, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew if it happens at all, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
I hear a stream running inside my soul,  
It's cold and clear and carries a tune.  
But I don't know what it sings and tells,  
I don't know where it goes.  
  
I wish I knew what it sings,  
I wish I knew where it goes,  
I wish I knew what it sings, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew where it goes, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it sings. (I wish I knew)  
  
(I wish I knew)  
(I wish I knew) (yeah!)  
(I wish I knew)  
(I wish I knew)
