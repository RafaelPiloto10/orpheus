It started way back in third grade  
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes  
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail  
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell  
Next day I chased her around the playground  
Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round  
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note  
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me do you want to be my friend  
And if you do  
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand  
If you want to  
I think this is how love goes  
Check yes or no  
  
Now we're grown up and she's my wife  
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes  
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou  
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room  
Last night I took her out in a white limousine  
Twenty years together she still gets to me  
Can't believe it's been that long ago  
When we got started with just a little note  
  
[Chorus]
