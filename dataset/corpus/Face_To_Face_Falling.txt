It's really easy if you try  
To tell another hundred lies  
But I'm not going down this time  
  
Just when I think I'm over it  
It's getting easy to forget  
I haven't even faced it yet  
  
I never wanted anyone to be so wrong for you  
  
Stop falling down  
  
I don't have anyone to blame  
I can't make anybody change  
I guess there's nothing more to say  
  
I never wanted anyone to be so wrong for you  
  
Stop falling down  
  
I won't believe it if you say that you will change  
I won't release you from responsibility  
I never wanted to come down on you this way  
I never wanted  
  
It's really easy if you try  
To tell another hundred lies  
But I'm not going down this time  
  
I never wanted anyone to be so wrong for you  
  
Stop falling down
