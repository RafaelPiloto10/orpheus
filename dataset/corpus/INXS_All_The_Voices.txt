Deep down in my heart  
There is a lot of words  
Tears fall down my face  
But I hear the many voices that cry in pain  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change things never doubt it  
  
We won't take new start  
Is it just too much to ask?  
Ooh, what does it take?  
'Cause I hear a million people singing the same  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change it  
We can change it  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
All the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people [Repeat: x5]
