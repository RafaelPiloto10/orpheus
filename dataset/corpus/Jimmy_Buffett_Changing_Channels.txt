Girl of a thousand faces  
From a long line of basket cases  
Daughter of a fortune teller  
Oh the lovely Isabella  
  
CHORUS  
  
She's changing channels  
Stayin' on her toes  
She's just changin' channels  
As she goes  
  
This place is full of beachhead sailors  
Fisherman and old retailers  
Simple lives are so deep seated  
and history always gets repeated  
Some folks see a birds eye view  
Others haven't got a clue  
Some will go and some will stay  
It doesn't matter anyway  
  
CHORUS  
  
They are changin' channels  
Crazy girls and boys  
  
They'll be changin' channels  
Changin' toys  
  
Survivors of tidal waves  
children of former slaves  
strange that they behave  
Like it's another world  
  
There's an island in the ocean  
Where the people stay in motion  
Somewhere on the old gulf stream  
Do they live or did I dream  
  
CHORUS  
  
They were changin' channels  
Waitin' for their sails to fill  
They were changin' channels  
Always will  
  
They'll be changin' channels  
Waitin' for their sails to fill  
They'll be changing channels  
Always will
