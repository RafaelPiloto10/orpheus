I was your first and you were my last  
And we are the journey's end  
I was the blues and you were my sunshine friend  
  
Now I'm your lover, you are my cover  
Keeping the loneliness from me  
You are my chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
You are the sea and I am the sailor  
Riding the perfect wave  
I could've drowned but you came around and save me  
She won't play your game  
  
Now I'm your hopes and you are my dreamer  
Helping me see beyond tomorrow  
You are the chosen one, you'll always be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Out of the darkness, out of the shadow  
Oh wherever you go, I'll follow along  
Wherever you lead me, wherever you need me  
I'll bring you my message, I'll bring you my song  
  
You are the chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Darlin' I choose you, I'll never use you  
I couldn't abuse you with all that you've done  
You are my sunshine, you are my lifeline  
Forever my sweet wine, forever the one
