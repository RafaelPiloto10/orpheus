[Verse 1]  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining  
Til He appeared and the spirit felt its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
  
[Verse 2]  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains He shall break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
O the world, the star is sweetly gleaming  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
  
[Outro]  
O the night when Christ was born  
When Christ was born  
When Christ was born
