my walkman and me  
  
with David Bowie

(you betcha)  
  
with teenage medication  
  
flowing through my veins  
  
I can face the strain and  
  
it's causing a sensation  
  
that I can't explain

my heart skips around  
  
when I hear the sound  
  
I'm never alone

I'm falling in love  
  
my walkman and me  
  
with David Bowie

I'm never alone  
  
cause you're following me home  
  
I'm falling in love  
  
my best friend and me
