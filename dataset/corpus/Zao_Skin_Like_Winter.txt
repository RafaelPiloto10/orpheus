Ashes to ashes dust to dust  
Beautiful child turnig into stone  
With your eyes so dim I shudder  
Bitterness runs through your soul  
  
Like small children  
Confusion dances in the dusk of your mind  
Echange your blessings for deceptions good night kiss  
Skin like winter  
  
Cherished one fading away  
I can see your breath begging to resurrect into death  
Hiding scars back laced with splinters  
Audience of a congregation make your way to the front  
  
Close your eyes and grieve  
You played your part so well
