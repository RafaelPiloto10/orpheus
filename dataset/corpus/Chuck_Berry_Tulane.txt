Tulane and Johnny opened a novelty shop,  
Back under the counter, was the cream of the crop,  
Ev'rything was clickin, and the business was good,  
'Till one day, lo and behold an officer stood.  
Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell,  
But Tulane made it over Johnny fell as he yelled,  
  
Chorus:  
Go head on, Tulane, he can't catch up with you.  
Go Tulane, he ain't man enough for you.  
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got.  
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot.  
Go Tulane, he's laggin behind.  
Go 'head on, Tulane.  
  
Go by your father's house and tell him business is slow  
And see if he will loan us something, soon as he hits the dough.  
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room  
Go by Doctor Keller's, tell him you swallowed some perfume  
Tell him we need him quick, 'cuz he may have to testify  
That you been sick all day and that's a perfect alibi  
  
Chorus:  
  
Go,let Daddy drive in case you run into the Man  
Back by the shop and get the stuff and hide it in the van.  
Go back by your father's, get the money for the bail.  
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten, funky jail.  
We gotta get a lawyer in the clique of politics  
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fixed.  
  
Chorus:  
Go 'head on, Tulane.
