Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
  
Whatever colors  
You have in your mind  
I'll show them to you  
And you'll see them shine  
  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay with your man awhile  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay with your man awhile  
  
Until the break of day  
Let me see you make him smile  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
  
His clothes are dirty  
But his, his hands are clean  
And you're the best thing  
That he's ever seen  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay with your man awhile  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
  
Why wait any longer  
For the world to begin  
You can have your cake  
And eat it too  
  
Why wait any longer  
For the one you love  
When he's standing, standing  
Standing in front of you  
  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay while the  
Night is still ahead  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
Stay, lady, stay, lady  
  
I long to see you  
In the morning light  
I wanna reach for you  
In the night  
  
Please, lady  
Please, lady  
Stay while the  
Night is still ahead  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
Lay, lady, lady  
Keep your shoes off, lady  
Relax yourself awhile  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Lay, lady, lay  
Stay, lady, stay  
Relax yourself awhile  
Lay, lady, lay  
  
Stay, lady, stay  
Relax yourself awhile  
Lay, lady, lay  
  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay, lady, lay...
