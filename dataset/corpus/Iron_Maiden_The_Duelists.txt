He threw down a glove you made the mistake  
Of picking it up now you're gone  
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords  
The choice of weapons is done  
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start  
You know you don't have a chance.  
CHORUS  
OH...OH...Fight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for the pleasure  
OH...OH...Fight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for your life!  
Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end.  
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and you're down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow.  
CHORUS  
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each  
other  
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down  
The Angel of Death hears your last breath  
Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.  
CHORUS  
OH...OH...Fought the honour  
Fought for the splendour  
Fought for the pleasure  
OH...OH...Fought for the honour  
fought for the splendour  
Fought to the death
