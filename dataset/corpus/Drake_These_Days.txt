[Verse 1]  
I've been out walking  
I don't do too much talking these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things, I forgot to do  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've met some women  
I wish I had resisted these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think  
About how I have failed  
To change all of my ways  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 3]  
Yeah, I had a lover  
Don't think I'd risk another  
These days  
These days  
And if I seem to be afraid  
Just listen to the life I've made in songs  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 4]  
I've stopped the dreaming  
I don't do too much scheming  
These days  
These days  
I sit inside chauffeur car  
With windows down and count the stars  
These days  
These days
