Caught a lite sneeze caught a lite breeze  
Caught a lightweight lightningseed  
Boys on my left side  
Boys on my right side  
Boys in the middle  
And you're not here I need a big loan  
From the girl zone  
  
Building  
Tumbling down  
Didn't know our love was so small  
Couldn't stand at all  
Mr St. John just bring your son  
  
The spire is hot  
And my cells can't feed  
And you still got that Belle dragging your foots  
I'm hiding it well Sister Ernestine  
But I still got that Belle  
Dragging my foots  
  
Right on time you get closer  
And closer  
Called my name but there's no way in  
Use that fame  
Rent your wife and kids today  
Maybe she will  
Maybe she will caught a lite sneeze  
Dreamed a little dream  
Made my own pretty hate machine  
Boys on my left side  
Boys on my right side  
Boys in the middle and you're not here  
Boys in their dresses  
And you're not here  
I need a big loan from the girl zone
