J. Bon jovi  
  
You know your favorite old pair of shoes  
The ones with the hole in the toe you wont lose  
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used  
But still you love to play when your feeling blue  
  
That faded rose that's all dried out  
Those bukowski poems we couldn't live without  
Your high school pic when you had wild hair  
That stormy day on the beach that got us here  
  
Oh, you better believe theres just one thing you need  
Can't you see...  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tall  
Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
  
Abd if your waves should ever break at sea  
Ill be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach  
I'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas  
Ill be by your side, you can count on me  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks  
Every time you go away  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
And if someday some new memory comes along  
Looking shiny new, feeling really strong  
You can tell him that Ill tell him  
He can just move on  
I'm a fighter - I've been fighting for you all night long  
Its just me baby
