It's a chemical attraction I just can't slide by  
Every time I look into my baby's eyes  
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I surrender  
  
There's a visual attraction and she's branded my soul  
Simply can't deny she has control  
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I remember  
  
She won't let me breakaway  
She won't let me breakaway  
I said break away, ah yeah  
  
We were workin' it though, baby we had a groove  
Movin' to the moment when we'd make our move  
But it happened, something happened  
And I'm not lyin' bout the pain  
  
She won't let me breakaway  
She won't let me breakaway  
I said breakaway, oh yeah  
  
I want the answer, I want my stuff  
I'm dealin' with a feelin' deeper than love  
I'm helpless, so helpless, but I remember  
  
She keeps sayin' breakaway  
Somethin's sayin' breakaway  
Tellin' me to breakaway  
Keeps on sayin' breakaway
