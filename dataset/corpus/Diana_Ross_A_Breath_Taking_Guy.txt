One night you held me tight  
And whispered in my ear  
All night sweet words  
I never heard  
And I believed every word  
  
Next day you came my way  
Without a word to say you passed me by  
You didn't give an eye  
My darling won't you tell me why  
You're acting strange toward me  
Why have you changed toward me  
  
Are you just a breathtaking  
First sight soul-shaking  
One night love-making  
Next day heartbreaking guy  
  
That night your love was true  
The next day we were through  
Your love won't come  
And you were moving on  
And I was left to cry alone  
What have I done to you  
Was it just fun to you  
  
Are you just a breathtaking  
First sight soul-shaking  
One night love-making  
Next day heartbreaking guy  
  
Breathtaking, soul shaking,  
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy  
Breathtaking, soul shaking,  
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy
