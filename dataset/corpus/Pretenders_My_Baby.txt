I want you to love me  
That's all I want from you  
I want you to love me  
One day  
  
I know I'm a peasant  
Dressed as a princess  
But that doesn't mean you have  
To take my clothes away  
  
If I could show you  
Some happiness  
Then I would feel  
Like a real princess  
That to me would be success  
My baby  
  
I seen you dancin'  
A natural beauty  
You make this dive  
Seem sublime  
You really get  
To the heart of the music  
You're the poetry of time  
  
If there's a method  
To writing a song  
How come I'm getting it wrong  
You write the beautiful songs  
Baby  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby  
Take my hand  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon show me  
To the love land  
  
Can this really happen  
In this day and age  
Suddenly  
To just turn the page  
Like walking on stage  
My baby
