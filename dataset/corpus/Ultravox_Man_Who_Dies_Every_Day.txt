Someone stood beside me for a moments in the rain  
A silhouette, a cigarette and a gesture of disdain  
I felt a dark door open, saw a sudden ghost come through  
A spark leap from my fingertip and I knew it must be you  
Ain't you the man who dies every day?  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
We never saw you walk in, we never saw you leave  
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybody's sleeve  
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace  
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder  
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older  
You flicker like a shaky shadow, moving like a thief  
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man
