Early mornin'  
Great  
I was out real late last night  
Got a little messy  
Early morning  
Can't be like that anymore  
No  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
  
Met a tall dude, kinda dark hair  
When he walked up somebody grabbed him  
But I liked him told him come here  
Kinda cool  
Baby, we can make plans  
Where ya live  
Do ya mama live there  
We can hook up at the hotel  
Hands down so I told him, let's go  
But have a next guess  
But you don't wanna know  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
  
Oh, in love  
So I approached him  
We gotta give him his friends  
There's something 'bout him that shows  
So I said, what the hell, let's go  
Got up, got on the dance floor  
Hooked up with a guy named Joe  
When the music was fast and slow  
But have a next guess  
But you don't wanna know  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
  
Call all your boys  
Call all your girls  
Call all your friends  
Let's do it again  
Let's do it again  
  
Yes  
Early morning  
Yes  
Can't keep doin' this  
  
I light your fire  
Your one desire  
Pull on me, baby  
And I'll take you higher  
  
You should try her  
So come over here and let's go so (woah woah)  
  
Ii was shaking my ass in the streets alone and

Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn
