Popped on me real hard and threw that back shot on me real hard,

with her friends,  
Tell her husband that theres another man, and she say that I made her fall in

I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was,  
A pimp from the beach, gator shoes on my feet,  
Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak,  
Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up,  
I looked at the bitch like cause
