Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Sure seems lonesome, Lord when the sun goes down  
  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head, up above
my head  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head  
Can tell Jesus, "Make up my dyin' bed"  
  
Well I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Yes I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die,
fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'
