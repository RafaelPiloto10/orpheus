Watching waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping sending leaving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
If I tried to write a million words a day  
I see your shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away  
  
Watching Waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping Sending leving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
We are travelling a million worlds away  
I see your Shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away
