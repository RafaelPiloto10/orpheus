There are paint smears on everything I own  
The vapor rub is lying on a table of filth  
Christmas cards to which I never reply  
My eyeballs absorb only blue filtered light  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
  
I wish they'd put prince namor on the tube  
Hold on, I think I have to puke  
There's a spot in the corner where I always go  
I like to feed the flies that I know  
  
But please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
  
Babies in prison, they call it a womb  
Nine month sentence, no parole  
Slivers of steel stuck in your lungs  
Breathe deep, we need a donor for blood  
  
Jaguars at the cemetary  
Cadillacs grazing at your grave  
Zeniths grazing at your grave  
Sonys grazing at your grave  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty
