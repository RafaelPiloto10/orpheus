I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
Soon as I saw the look in her eyes  
Should known it was over over  
  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
'Cause I can't take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy  
  
God help me don't want to be  
Don't want to be a loser  
Loser no more  
Please help me help me to see  
Help me to see the chooser  
Chooser for sure  
  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
'Cause I can't take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy
