I hurt your feelings when I said you're kinda green  
Of an age that's in between and you don't know what love mear  
You think you love me maybe love has made you blind  
'Cause you're full new emotions of a young and foolish kind.  
  
Show me you're a woman  
'Cause a woman has the kind of a love I'm a-needin'  
Show me you're a woman and I'll show you that I'm a man  
Just give me what I'm after  
It's a smile and the sound of your girlish laughter  
When you are a woman  
I'm your man.  
  
Don't try to fool me ''cause I know about your age  
And it's written on a page of the memories that I've saved.  
I know you're only trying hard to do what's right  
But you're young and so you might have to wait for Cupid's bite.  
  
Show me you're a woman . .
