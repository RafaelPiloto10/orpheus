Whirlwind you must know he can't leave  
Ever since he was young he had known what a man should know  
With no hatred inside  
  
Whirlwind take the wife and the child  
Find the trail that leads south  
To the lands they have given you  
The new home for your tribe  
  
Brother of blood  
I have heard that the soldiers are two moons away  
They come with many guns  
And death is waiting for a brave man  
Such as you  
  
Goodbye my friend you must be on your way  
Down through the canyons we wait and we pray  
Goodbye my friend you can linger no more  
Gun smoke is rising so run to that war  
Beyond the hills the far horizon  
In the purple evening sky  
You'll find the valley of walhalla  
There when you die
