Was it wonderful for you?  
Was it holy as it was for me?  
Did you feel the hand of destiny  
That was guiding us together?  
You were young enough to dream  
I was old enough to learn something new  
I'm so glad I got to dance with you  
For a moment of forever  
Sometimes when you're cryin', you're happy  
Sometimes you're just cryin'  
I know. I know.  
Come whatever happens now  
Ain't it nice to know that dreams still come true  
I'm so glad that I was close to you  
For a moment of forever.
