Deep river woman  
Lord I'm coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know she's waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
I spent a night in L.A.  
Just another chance to see you  
Just you and I  
Wanted you to know  
That my playing days are over  
'Cause all I do is think of you  
The writing's on the wall  
  
Deep river woman  
Lord I'm coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know she's waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
I've been out in the world  
Yes, the fast life had me going  
Now all that's changed  
I finally make up my mind  
About the one thing  
I've been knowing  
You're the only girl  
I've ever cared for in this world  
  
Deep river woman  
Lord I'm coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know she's waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
You kind of love girl is forever  
It took me a long time to realize  
That I've come so far  
And end up going nowhere  
Oh, girl, I need you by my side  
  
Oh deep river woman  
Lord I'm coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know she's waiting  
Just anticipating all my love
