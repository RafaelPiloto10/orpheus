A star up in the sky will never know  
How lovely is the light that shines below  
It's always there, it never fades  
Without its magic light  
How would we find our way?.  
  
And you don't know how beautiful you are  
If your eyes could see the love that's in your heart  
Then you would know, what everybody sees  
That beautiful is all that you could be.  
  
What did I feel or think was true  
I can't remember before loving you  
You've shown me all that love can be  
As beautiful as you are  
It still amazes me.  
  
That you don?t know ...
