There's a tear in my beer  
Cause I'm cryin for you, dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
Into these last nine beers  
I have shed a million tears  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
I'm gonna keep drinkin'  
Until I'm petrified  
And then maybe, these tears will leave my eyes  
There's a tear in my beer  
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Last night I walked the floor  
And the night before  
You were on my lonely mind  
It seems my life is through  
And I'm so dog gone blue  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
I'm gonna keep drinkin  
Til I can't move a toe  
And then maybe, my heart won't hurt me so  
There's a tear in my beer  
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Lord, I've tried and I've tried  
But my tears, I can't hide  
You are on my lonely mind  
All these blues that I've found  
Have really got me down  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
I'm gonna keep drinkin  
'Til I can't even think  
'Cause in the last week, I ain't slept a week  
There's a tear in my beer  
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear  
You are on my lonely mind
