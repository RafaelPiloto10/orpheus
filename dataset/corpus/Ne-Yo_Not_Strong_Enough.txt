First let me say, I know it's late  
Girl I can tell you were sleeping  
So sorry to wake you, but what I'ma say to you tonight  
Girl it just couldn't wait, no, not one more day  
No, not one more hour  
Mmm, we've been a... Some time, you went your way I went mine  
My manhood won't let me cry  
But you act like I'm alright is something I just can't do  
Something I just can't do  
Keep it... That I'm walking without you  
So, something I just can't do  
What if I could, I'm just not strong enough to, whoa  
Not strong enough to who  
Keep lying to you, babe,  
I'm just not strong enough to, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl  
  
I can see you looking at me,  
You're thinking too little too late  
Cause it was me that said that we shouldn't be  
But that was before I could think straight  
My pride, it made me lie, lie, lie  
To you and to myself about what I need  
So now I walk around with this lie, truly dying inside  
Acting like I'm just fine, it's something I just can't do  
Something just I can't do, keep pretending  
That I'm okay without, just said something I just can't do  
Something I just can't do  
What if could I'm just no strong enough to, whoa  
Not strong enough to who  
Keep lying to you, babe,  
I'm just not strong enough to, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl  
  
Said I'm trying to be honest, then making you a promise  
I'm gonna be true to you  
Cause me trying to deny that without you I would die  
Something I just can no longer do  
Said I'm trying to be honest, then making you a promise  
I'm gonna be true to you  
Cause me trying to deny that without you I would die  
Something I just can no longer do  
  
Hey, hey, oho, oho, oho, hey  
Hey, hey, oho, oho, oho, hey
