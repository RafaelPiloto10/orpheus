I been balling a shiny black steel jack-hammer,  
Been chippin' up rocks for the great highway,  
Live five years if I take my time,  
Ballin' that jack and a drinkin' my wine.  
  
I been chippin' them rocks from dawn till doom,  
While my rider hide my bottle in the other room.  
Doctor say better stop ballin' that jack,  
If I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I will.  
  
Easy wind cross the Bayou today  
Cause there's a whole lotta women, mama,  
Out in red on the streets today.  
And the rivers keep a talkin',  
But you never heard a word it said.  
  
Gotta find a woman be good to me,  
Won't hide my liquor try to serve me tea,  
Cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true  
And I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will.  
  
Easy wind going cross the Bayou today  
There's a whole lotta women  
Out in red on the streets today.  
And the rivers keep a talkin',  
But you never heard a word it said.
