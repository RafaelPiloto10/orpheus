I've been told in the name of something  
I've got to know what it means to play the game  
  
Too many faces around they're talking  
They play their parts oh, so well but who's to blame  
  
Back on the streets, that's where we are  
Building a fortress of power, yeah! We're coming  
  
You know better than me the rules are:  
Getting better or fat in the mania  
  
It's good to know who is who in our game  
The speed is faster, it's harder to see where we are  
  
Back on the streets  
  
Please Mister Know-how just bring me the news  
I'm waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell  
  
There's one thing about you, you're dying to prove  
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell  
  
Back on the streets
