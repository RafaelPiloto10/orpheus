You better watch out  
'cause I'm on the streets tonight  
  
We'll it's party time, I'm all zipped up  
It's hot tonight and I'm ready for love  
Jack me up  
'cause I'm on the loose tonight  
  
I want a little action, some company  
No main attraction, no star on tv  
No long engagement  
Reach straight for the gun  
No permanent arrangement  
I just want some fun  
  
Party, gonna be a party  
Party, oh it's party time  
  
Well it's 9 o'clock, I'm all juiced up  
Gonna find a club  
Gonna get hooked up
