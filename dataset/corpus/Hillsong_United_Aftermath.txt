The skies lay low where you are  
On the earth you rest your feet  
Yet the hands that cradle the stars  
Are the hands that bled for me  
And in that moment  
Of glorious surrender  
You were broken  
For all the world to see  
Lifted out of the ashes  
I am found in the aftermath  
Freedom found in your scars  
And in your grace my life redeemed  
For you chose  
To take the sinners crown  
As you placed your crown on me  
And in that moment  
Of glorious surrender  
Was the moment  
You broke the chains in me  
Lifted out of the ashes  
I am found in the aftermath  
And in that moment  
You opened up the heavens  
To the broken, the beggar and the thief  
Lifted out of the wreckage  
I found hope in the aftermath  
And I know  
You're with me  
Yes I know, you're with me here  
And I know, your love will light the way  
And I know, Your with me  
Yes I know, you're with me here  
And I know  
Your love will light the way  
Now all I have  
I count it all as lost  
But to know you  
To carry the cross  
Knowing I'm found  
In the light, of the aftermath
