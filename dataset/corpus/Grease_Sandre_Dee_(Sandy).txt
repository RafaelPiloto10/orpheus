Look at me,  
There has to be,  
Something more than what they see,  
Wholesome and pure,  
So scared and unsure,  
A poor mans Sandra dee.  
  
When they criticise and make fun of me,  
Don't they see the tears in my smile?  
Don't they realize there's just one of me?  
It has to last me a while.  
  
Sandy you must start at a new,  
Don't you no what you must do-,  
Hold your head high,  
Take a deep breath and sigh--,  
Goodbye.  
To Sandra Deeeeee--
