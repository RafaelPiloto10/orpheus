I am not American,  
Though I live in North America  
Which is part of the Americas  
Which should make me an American  
Geographically Canadians,  
Are certainly Americans  
As are Venisallians,  
But not Hawaiians  
They're out in the middle of the Ocean  
Just like the you. S. Virgin Islands,  
Who shoudn't say they are Americans,  
Or even Virgins  
How could two whole continents,  
Lose their name to one Constitute  
Where were we when the you. S. Went,  
And took the word American away?  
But to be fair to them,  
Their other name options,  
Like you. S. A. Ers or United Statesians,  
Were pretty bad  
Still I want to be as American,  
As the French are European,  
Or those in Antarctica are Antarctican  
Even if they're just penguins  
That leaves us Canadians as Northern North American,  
But Alaskas Norther curse them  
We're surrounded by Americans  
Americans, Americans!  
I just called those you. S. A. Ers Americans  
A name meant for two continents not just them  
For if I said I was American,  
People would probably think I came from Maine  
Still I think I have a plan,  
Let's become Antarctican,  
And join up with the penguins  
For just like them, we're not American!
