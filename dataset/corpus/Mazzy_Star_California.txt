I think I'm going back to California  
Somewhere distant and it's so far away  
It's so far  
It's so far  
Far away  
  
I think I'll drift across the ocean now  
Clouds looks so clear in your eyes  
Let me bring all my  
Let me bring all my friends  
  
I think I'll fly across the ocean  
I can watch the sky turning grey  
I think I'm going back  
I think I'll go back  
  
I think I hear the whisper of my oldest friend  
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square  
California  
California
