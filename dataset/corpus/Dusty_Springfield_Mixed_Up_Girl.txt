Ah, ha, ah  
Gonna let you go, my angel  
Though I could make you stay  
I could use my blind self-pity  
Throw it in your way  
But the times have turned between us  
And you know I don't believe  
That it makes one bit of difference  
If you stay or if you leave  
  
Why can't I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river?  
Pushing down a mountain  
On it's way to meet the sea  
  
Why can't I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean?  
Why did you have to get so mixed up, baby?  
With a mixed up girl  
With a mixed up girl like me, yeah  
  
Gonna make it short now, angel  
Though I could make it long  
I could take through all the changes  
And show you where you're wrong  
  
But our dreams don't flow together  
And you'll never, never see the light  
So it really, really doesn't matter  
Who is wrong or who is right?  
Oh, why can't I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river?  
It's pushing down the mountain  
On its way to meet the sea  
  
Oh, why can't I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean?  
Why did you have to get so mixed up, baby  
With a mixed up girl  
With a mixed up girl like me?  
Mmm, oh, mmm, oh
