Lucy it's time for bed now, and you need your rest  
So lie down in your coffin dear, and sleep tight  
I'll wake you when Daddy's here, alright?  
No no don't don't cry little girl  
Little girl from head to toe  
Deep into the ground you go down down!  
  
Sleep tight little baby, sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby, nowhere to run around  
  
OH The worms, oh the worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy?  
  
Sleep tight little baby, sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby, nowhere to run around  
  
Oh The worms, oh the worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy?  
  
And as I'm waiting by the cemetery gates  
For her father to show  
Something's pounding at my head  
It's like I I, I can still hear her SCREAMING  
  
[SOLO: Andy]  
  
Oh Lucy, I'm doing all this for you  
Oh Lucy, I didn't mean to, I didn't want to  
But you've got to  
  
Sleep tight little baby, sleep tight below the ground  
Sleep tight little baby, nowhere to run around  
  
OH The worms, Oh The worms  
  
Is that your Daddy your Daddy ?  
  
So you came at last ? Let me see your heart  
Let me see your face, you son of a bitch  
  
[SOLO: Herb]  
  
I see a baby crying, I see a little tear  
Oh yeah, I know you're trying  
But you can't stop the fear DADDY!  
  
If you ever want to see your little girl again  
You better do as I say  
Dear Mr. Mayor, welcome to my humble tomb  
Come inside, you know you have to
