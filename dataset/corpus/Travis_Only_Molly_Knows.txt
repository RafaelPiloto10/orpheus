When the day is done  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be the one  
  
When the day is through  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be with you  
  
Tell me what to do  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me follow through  
  
'Cause I am lost at sea  
Oh Molly Molly  
Haven't got a clue  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows  
  
When the lights go down  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will you be around  
  
When the lights are gone  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will you leave the town  
  
Tell me what is wrong  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me sing a song  
  
'Cause I have lost the will  
Oh Molly Molly  
Cannot carry on  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows  
  
When the day is done  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be the one  
  
When the day is through  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be with you  
  
Tell me what to do  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me follow through  
  
Where are we to be tomorrow Molly  
Haven't got a clue  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows
