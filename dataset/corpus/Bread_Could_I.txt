I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
You're old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go.  
  
And what we're here for  
What do you fear for  
It's hard enough to hear the though in mind  
That now you're there  
And then you're gone  
Let's get in  
  
I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
You're old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go.  
  
You're never really tried let yourself be satisfied  
Now don't deny it  
Until you try it  
You're played the game so long  
You think that life goes on and on  
You better use it  
Before you lose it.
