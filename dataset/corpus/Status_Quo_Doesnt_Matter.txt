Doesn't matter, doesn't matter if the rain comes down  
I'll find a reason, find a reason if it can be found  
'cause something happened, something happened while I wasn't around  
It could be better, could be better with the rain all around  
You had no reason, no special reason  
For saying what you said to her about me  
She must believe you, really believe you  
Or else she wouldn't have had anything to do with you now  
I often wonder, just sit and wonder  
Does everybody make the same mistakes too?  
I may go under when I feel under  
So don't you take advantage of the situation I'm in  
Forever breaking promises, it's little wonder  
To mend a broken heart is heartache, heartache  
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter if the rain comes down  
I'll find a reason, find a reason if it can be found  
'cause something happened, something happened while I wasn't around  
It could be better, could be better with the rain all around  
Here's a reminder, a small reminder  
Of how things were before you came into view  
It was together, being together  
So don't believe anything you said, makes any difference at all  
You had no reason, no special reason  
For saying what you said to her about me  
It was together, being together  
So don't believe anything you said, makes any difference at all  
Forever breaking promises, it's little wonder  
To mend a broken heart is heartache, heartache
