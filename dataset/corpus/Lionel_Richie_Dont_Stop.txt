I can feel the night time coming  
I can feel my resistance falling so low  
Don't you know baby you got it  
This hold on me  
But I love just what you're doing  
Oh you're all I need  
  
When I'm dancing with you girl  
With the lights down low  
The power you possess  
You know I can't let go  
Oh listen to me  
Don't stop moving, baby  
Tonight's the night  
Don't stop moving baby  
It'll be alright  
  
Can't you feel the fire burning?  
It feels so right  
Oh can't you feel my body yearning?  
Hold me tight  
Don't hold back, keep rising  
Girl can't you see  
All I need is your sweet loving  
Oh to satisfy me  
  
When you move your arms close  
The magic's in your eyes  
You know you turn me on  
You've got me hypnotized  
Oh let me tell you  
Don't stop moving baby  
Tonight's the night  
Oh don't stop moving baby  
It'll be alright  
Listen to me, don't stop moving baby  
Tonight's the night  
Oh don't stop moving baby  
It'll be alright  
Oh, it's you for me, everything I want  
Everything I need  
We are lucky to feel  
What we feel tonight  
All the love that's been together  
Tonight's the night  
  
Oh baby don't stop moving baby  
Tonight's the night  
Don't stop moving baby  
It'll be alright  
Don't stop, I said don't stop
