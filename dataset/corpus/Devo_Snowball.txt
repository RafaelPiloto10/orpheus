My baby took our love  
And then she rolled it up  
Rolled it up a hill  
Like a ball of snow  
Like a snowball grows  
Until it gets too big  
Until she lost control  
And it rolled back down [Repeat: x3]  
  
She took a tiny bit  
And rolled it up again  
Slower than before  
She went a step too far  
She had to let it go  
I saw it go straight down  
My baby turned around  
Started up again [Repeat: x3]  
  
Eyes were made for looking'  
Hands were made for holdin'  
Hearts were made for lovin'  
Lips were made for kissin'  
Legs were made for walkin'  
Tracks were made to follow  
That's what I'm gonna do  
  
Two tracks  
In the snow  
Two tracks  
Up that hill  
My heart broke  
When my baby left  
Two tracks behind
