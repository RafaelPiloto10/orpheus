Break my back with hard lovin'  
Take my hand and keep movin'  
Don't slow down we're nearly there now  
Oh can you stand the pain  
I'm a hard lovin' man  
  
What's your name? It's alright now  
Trick or treat we're uptight now  
Wanna feel ya I wanna hear ya  
Oh here we go again  
I'm a hard lovin' man  
  
Come back here it's not over  
Can't you see there's still time girl  
I can last make if fast now  
Oh gotta catch a train  
I'm a hard lovin' man
