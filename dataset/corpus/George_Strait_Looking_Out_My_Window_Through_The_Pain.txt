I watched from my window as she slipped from the house  
Once again she's leaving, but Lord, she's not to blame  
This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break  
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay  
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I won't be left lonely,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But Lord I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain
