There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldn't be  
Anyone else but you  
  
If I could take my pick of all the girls  
I've ever known  
Then I'd come and pick you out to be my very own  
  
There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldn't be  
Anyone else but you  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me  
'Cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When you belong to me then I am gonna prove to you  
How true my love can be  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me  
cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When you'll belong to me  
'Cause then I'm gonna prove to you
