Well, you wake up in the morning  
Hear the ding-dong ring  
You go marching to the table  
See the same old thing  
See the fork on the table  
Nothing in your pan  
If you sing a thing about it  
You're in trouble with the man  
  
Let the midnight special shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
If you ever go to houston  
Well, you better act right  
And you better not gamble  
And you better not fight  
For the sheriff will arrest you  
Then he'll take you down  
And before you understand it  
You are prison bound  
  
Let the midnight special  
Shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special  
Shine it's ever loving light on me  
On me, on me
