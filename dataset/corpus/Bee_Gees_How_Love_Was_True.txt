Ooh. love was true yesterday  
I love you ev'ry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me 'cause to stare  
And then I knew, I had to have you  
  
You could be mine if you tried  
All that you do is tell me lies  
You think that love's a game  
But I don't feel the same  
I should have known that I'll get the pain  
  
Ooh, love was true yesterday  
I love you ev'ry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me 'cause to stare  
And then knew I had to have you
