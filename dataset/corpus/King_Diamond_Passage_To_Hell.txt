What was that sound?  
I slowly turn around, something moved  
A void of darkness in the floor, where the altar stood  
I move a little closer, cause I cannot see from where I stand  
Blood still running down my arm, from all the cuts in my hands  
  
I must enter the unholy cell  
I must enter a passage to Hell  
Someone is ringing the bell  
  
But there is only me, there is no one else  
I think I hear a voice from deep within the hole  
I wonder who could be in there, the strong smell of old  
  
I must enter the unholy cell  
I must enter a passage to Hell  
I can barely see the stairs below  
Stairs on which I know my feet must go
