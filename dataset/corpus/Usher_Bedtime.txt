Craving your body all through the night  
Feels like I'm going through withdrawals  
I want to hold you  
I want you inside of these arms  
  
I'm dying to taste you I can't deny  
Can't get it out of my mind  
Please let me hold you  
Cause I need your lovin' tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Whenever I'm near you  
My love just comes down  
Whenever I see you  
I just want you around  
Cause I want to feel you  
All through the day and the night  
Whenever I'm near you  
It feels like bedtime  
  
Constantly thinking of things to do  
Places where we can make love  
I want to freak you  
I'll freak you wherever you want  
  
Placing my kisses all over you  
Caressing you so nice and slow  
Oh how I want you  
Girl there's something I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you get lonely?  
(I get so lonely)  
Thinking about me  
(thinking about you)  
  
Am I the only  
(girl I think of or dream of at all)  
Are you into ,out your mind for me? Say you can't go a day without me  
(girl I need you and I want you girl I need you I need you I need you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It feels like bedtime
