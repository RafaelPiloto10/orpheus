You live your life day by day  
You can't feel it's slipping away  
It's like heaven where you never get bored  
You self inflicted Rock 'n roll whore  
  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel the clocks ticking away  
  
The world doesn't change in a day  
The world doesn't change it  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
You've got a thousand wounds to heal  
You gotta stop thinking nothing's for real  
Electric shock won't bring you back  
You're fading baby  
You fade to black  
  
The world doesn't change in a day  
The world doesn't change it  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you mean  
To me  
  
When you are the one inside  
Is it what you thought it'd be  
I always knew you'd be a star  
And now you are
