Wished i had told her  
Ooh she was my only one  
But it's too late, it's too late  
She's gone  
  
It's too late, she's gone now  
I know she's gone now  
It's too late, my baby's gone now  
I need her loving  
Oh more than anyone ooh  
But it's too late, i know it's too late  
She's gone  
  
It's a weak man that cry now  
So i guess i better  
Guess i better dry my weeping eyes now  
I need her loving  
More than anyone oh  
But it's too late  
It seems like it's too late  
She's gone  
  
She's gone, my baby's gone,  
She's gone, oh my baby, she's gone  
She's gone, my baby's she's gone  
But where can, where can my my baby be  
  
Lord, i wonder sometimes  
Does she really know  
Does she really know  
Does she really know when she left me  
Oh it hurt little heart so now  
I need your loving  
Please don't make me wait  
Lord, but it's too late, it's too late  
She's gone  
I need your loving  
Oh more than anyone  
Don't let it be too late  
No, don't let it be too late  
But she's gone  
  
Wished i had told her  
Ooh she was my only one  
Ooh but it's too late  
I know it's to late  
She's gone  
Wished i had told her  
Oh she was the only one...
