Son she said  
Have I got a little story for you  
What you thought was your daddy  
Was nothin' but a...  
  
While you were sitting  
Home alone at age thirteen  
Your real daddy was dyin'  
Sorry you didn't see him  
But I'm glad we talked,

Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive  
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive, well...  
  
Oh she walks slowly  
Across a young man's room  
She said I'm ready, for you  
I can't remember anything  
To this very day  
'Cept the look, yeah the look  
Oh, you know where

Of course there is  
You're still alive she said  
Oh do I deserve to be?

And if so, if so
