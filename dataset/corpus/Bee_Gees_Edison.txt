He made electric lights to read.  
He gave us light today.  
He gave us cylinders to please.  
When Edison came to stay. Edison came to stay.  
  
Edison set the world on fire.  
He really made the day.  
Station to station, many wires.  
Edison came to stay.  
Edison came to stay.  
  
Oh, how, look at us now.  
We've still got a lot to learn.  
But it's someone else's turn.  
Edison's here to stay.  
Edison's here to stay.  
  
All of the world can taste his glory.  
All of the people say.  
You be the man to write his story.  
Edison's here to stay.  
Edison's here to stay.  
  
Oh, how, look at us now.  
We've still got a lot to learn.  
But it's someone else's turn.  
Edison's here to stay.  
Edison's here to stay.  
  
He made electric lights to read.  
He gave us light today.  
He gave us cylinders to please,  
when Edison came to stay.  
Edison came to stay.  
Edison came to stay.  
Edison came to stay.  
  
You be the man to write his story.  
Edison came to stay.  
Edison came to stay.  
All of his world can hear his story.  
Edison came to stay. [Repeats]
