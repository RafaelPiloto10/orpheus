I don't believe in superstars  
In fancy food or foreign cars  
That Hagen Dazs and motherhood  
Have done my body any good.  
That Elvis is alive and well  
That courtesy has gone to Hell  
That kindness is in short supply  
That little kids should have to die.  
  
But I believe in love.  
I believe in dreamers.  
I believe in miracles  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I don't believe virginity  
Is as common as it used to be  
That left is wrong and right is right  
That black is black and white is white.  
That the Beatles could be history  
The sixties just a memory  
That war will never go away  
That Johnny Carson's had his day.  
  
But I believe in love  
I believe in angels  
I believe in Mom and Dad  
And I believe in you  
  
I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing  
I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
Now, I don't believe that Heaven waits  
For only those who congregate  
I like to think that God is love.  
He's down below, He's up above,  
And He's watching people everywhere  
He knows who does and doesn't care.  
And I'm an ordinary girl  
Trying to make my way in this old world.  
  
And I believe in love  
Yes, I believe in music  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing, a good thing  
And I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
You know darlin', that I believe in love.  
Yes, I believe in dreamers  
I believe in miracle  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah-ho-ho-oh baby, I believe  
Yes, I believe.  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah, come on, baby, say you believe in love.  
Say you believe in dreamin'.  
Believe in blue, blue skies,  
'Cause I believe in you . . .
