(feat. Steve Earl)  
  
I'm an American, boys, and I've come a long way,  
Born and bred in the USA  
So listen up close, I've got something to say  
Boys, I'm buying this round  
Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight  
And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right  
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight,  
If I have to spend my last pound  
  
When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain  
Met a little girl in the field canteen  
Painted her name on the nose of my plane  
Six more missions, I'm gone  
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might  
Then the warden came around yelling "Turn out the lights"  
Death rainin' out of the London night  
We made love 'til dawn  
  
[Chorus:]  
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home  
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan  
They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone  
When Johnny comes marching home  
  
My P-47 is a pretty good ship  
And she took a round comin' cross the channel last trip  
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip  
Always got me through so far  
Well they can ship me all over this great big world  
But I'll never find nothing like my North End girl  
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir  
Soon as we win this war  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now my grandaddy sang this song  
Told me about London when the Blitz was on  
How he married grandma and brought her back home  
A hero thoughout his land  
Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego  
A couple Purple Hearts and I move a little slow  
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows  
About a place called Vietnam  
  
[Chorus]
