A thousand miles, dear  
A thousand more across the water  
Across the shore  
I'll say a prayer, dear  
For yours and mine  
Please think of me, dear  
Each night at nine  
  
I hold your picture  
Close to my heart  
It takes your place, dear  
While we're apart  
Helps remind me  
That you're still mine  
To feel your nearness  
Each night at nine  
  
The bugle's playing  
Out go the lights  
Even it's lonely these army nights  
Go tell kids I'm doing fine  
Give them my love, dear  
Each night at nine  
A thousand miles, dear  
A thousand more across the water  
Across the shore  
I'll say a prayer, dear  
For yours and mine  
Please think of me, dear  
Each night at nine
