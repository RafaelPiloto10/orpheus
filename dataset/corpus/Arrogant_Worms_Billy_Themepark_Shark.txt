I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
A killer of the ocean,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
And silently I strike.  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm dumber than a tree,  
I only have three thoughts and they are: eat, swim, ... Eat.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I was swimming in the ocean,  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I got picked up by a boat.  
A team of lonely fishermen sold me to a park,  
And now my name is Billy, I'm a Theme Park Shark.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head.  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
The sight of blood once put me in a frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool...  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm swimming in a pool,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I don't have to fight for food,  
I get three meals a day, and some extra on the weekend  
And I'm the only shark I know who has a dental plan.  
Who has a dental plan.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
And I'm a big attraction.  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
They love to watch me jump,  
I've been the star for years and I've never been for sale,  
At least until the owners think they need a killer whale.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Jumping out football nets suspended overhead,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
But I'm not in my natural habitat,  
He's fat and old and lazy,  
But I'm happy you're here.  
I really hope these activists don't free Billy,  
'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead.  
  
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
  
He looks just like a killer, in the wild, he'd be dead.  
  
Oh, Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The number one attraction of an aqua petting zoo.  
Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The poster fish of tourism Iowa!
