Don't get no attention from the people on street  
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet  
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we  
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be  
But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care  
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need  
  
Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store  
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford  
People all around us with their noses in the air  
They walk right on by us just like we're not even there  
But I got you and you got me...  
  
I got you and you got me...  
  
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need
