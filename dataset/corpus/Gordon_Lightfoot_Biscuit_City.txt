I'd like to be in biscuit city  
With my banjo in my hand  
I don't need no long vacation  
In some foreign land  
Cause the sound of my own breathing  
Has been turning to a sigh  
I wish that I could make the time  
To be in biscuit city by and by  
Oh the water is of emerald  
And the beach is white as snow  
And everyone's got money  
And no place to go  
In a land of milk and honey  
It can really make you smile  
And if I had a ticket  
I would stay in biscuit city for a while  
All the girls are in bikinis  
All the boys are in the buff  
With the baby in between and  
That makes three of us  
And the streets are all so quiet  
And the walls are squeaky clean  
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til  
The town of biscuit city you have seen  
I'd rather be in biscuit city  
With my banjo in my hand  
Than take a big vacation  
In some foreign land  
Cause the sound of my own breathing  
Has been turning to a sigh  
If it were not for misfortune  
I would be in biscuit city by and by  
If it were not for misfortune  
I would stay in biscuit city 'til I die
