Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us,  
All men and women living on the Earth.  
Ties of hope and love,  
Sister and brotherhood,  
That we are bound together  
In our desire to see the world  
Become a place in which our children  
Can grow free and strong.  
We are bound together by the task  
That stands before us  
And the road that lies ahead.  
We are bound and we are bound.  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest  
  
Shed a little light, oh Lord,  
So that we can see,  
Just a little light, oh Lord.  
Want to stand it on up,  
Stand it on up, oh Lord,  
Want to walk it on down,  
Shed a little light, oh Lord.  
  
Can't get no light from the dollar bill,  
Don't give me no light from a TV screen.  
When I open my eyes I want to drink my fill  
From the well on the hill,  
Do you know what I mean?  
  
Shed a little light, oh Lord,  
So that we can see,  
Just a little light, oh Lord.  
Want to stand it on up,  
Stand it on up, oh Lord,  
Want to walk it on down,  
Shed a little light, oh Lord.  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist,  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest.  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest.  
  
Oh, Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us.  
All men and women living on the Earth,  
Ties of hope and love,  
Sister and brotherhood.
