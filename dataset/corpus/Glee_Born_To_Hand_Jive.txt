Before I was born late one night,  
My Papa said everything's alright  
The doctor laughed,when mama laid down,  
With a stomach bouncing all around  
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive  
  
I could barely walk when I milked a cow  
When I was three, I pushed a plow  
While chopping wood I moved my legs,  
And I started dancing while I gathered eggs  
Townfolk clapped, I was only five  
he'll out dance em' all  
"He's a born hand-jive!"  
  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - everybody!  
  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive baby- yeah!  
  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
  
Higher, higher, higher and higher  
Now can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah  
Born to hand-jive, oh yeah!
