You're the queen of your own little  
World, you really made a splash  
Got the offers rollin' in but you're  
Nothing more than high paid trash  
Everybody wants to know what goes  
On in your head  
Pity if they found out that you're lonely  
In your bed  
Maybe it all happened to you just a  
Little too fast  
  
Won't let anybody touch you  
So you do it for yourself  
Plain to see there's a woman  
Cryin' out for help  
  
You're a superstar, but  
You don't know who you are  
And your money won't  
Get you very far  
You're a mystery,  
Nothing can set you free  
Your demons haunt you endlessly  
  
You face the end of your youth in a tired  
Little masquerade  
You talk to people with a tongue like a  
Newly sharpened razor blade  
Yours is not a life that lets you take a  
Look inside  
Morals and convictions meet a fate of  
Genocide  
But in the end you'll be sleeping in the  
Bed you made  
  
All you want's a daddy  
The one you never had  
A need for understanding  
Aching in your head  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your money won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, it seems so clear to me  
There's something that you'd rather be  
  
Take a look around you now  
Before it's much too late  
Make the choice to change  
Or be a victim of your fate  
All your life you've been  
Running from the girl inside  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your fame won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, oh but it's plain to see  
There's someone that you'd rather be
