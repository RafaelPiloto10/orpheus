Rising with the morning sun  
I turn to greet the dawn  
Knowing I must face another day  
Sleepless night behind me  
Just a memory of pain  
My heart has always been a cross to bear  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord, I know the sunshine  
But I feel the tears of rain  
Falling down to wash my sins away  
I'll try hard to remember  
So I won't be fooled again  
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today  
  
All around me shadows fall  
Though day has just begun  
I realize I'm on my own again  
Memories of broken dreams  
As distant as the sun  
Are drifting like an echo in the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Babe, I thought about it  
But it just ain't done good  
You hold my heart and soul within your hand  
All the time, you're in my mind  
I never thought you could be so blind  
Maybe someday I will understand  
  
Lord, I know the sunshine  
But I feel the tears of rain  
Falling down to wash my sins away  
I'll try hard to remember  
So I won't be fooled again  
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today, no more  
  
Hey, mama, you drive me crazy  
Knowing you're my heart's desire  
Why'd you go and hang me up this way?  
You've given me love, given me love  
Now tell me what you were thinking of  
Why'd you go and steal my soul away?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't gonna cry no more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't gonna cry no more  
Hey, I ain't gonna cry no more today
