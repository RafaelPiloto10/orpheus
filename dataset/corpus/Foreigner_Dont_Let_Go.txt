Another long day, another long night  
I try to make it home before it gets light  
I'm working hard so some day we can play  
When I try to explain you just push me away  
Don't push me away, you say  
I don't spend enough time with you  
Or take an interest in things you do  
We call it quits almost every other day  
And the rare times we're going strong  
We let our pride get in the way  
Seems like it's always in the way  
But don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right  
This kinda life can put us both to the test  
But it's not a question of who knows best  
Our love's a ship that has it's sails a little torn  
All we need to do is sew 'em up  
And we can weather the storm  
Gonna ride that storm  
So don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go  
No, no, don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
Don't let go of our love when it feels right  
I don't see you for days  
When you leave me in the dark  
My imagination runs away  
Just throw me a line  
And I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
And I won't let go  
Don't let go, don't let our love go  
Baby don't let go, just let our love grow  
Oh, no, don't let our love fade away  
And don't let go of our love when it feels right, oh no  
Don't let our love go  
Don't let go  
Just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might slip away  
Don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right
