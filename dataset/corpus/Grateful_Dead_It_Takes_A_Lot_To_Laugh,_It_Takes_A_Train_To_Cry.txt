Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby, can't buy a thrill  
Well, I've been up all night, baby, leanin' on the window sill  
Well, if I die on top of the hill  
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will  
Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees?  
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the "Double E"?  
Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea?  
Don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me?  
Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost  
I want to tell everybody, but I could not get across  
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss  
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost
