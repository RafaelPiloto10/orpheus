When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong to me  
When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong with me  
  
Sweet Forgiveness  
How could go my babe  
I never really knew how I needed you, but you were right there  
(I don't know the rest)  
  
Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me.  
When you hold me close,  
And you say, "That's all over."  
You don't go looking back,  
You don't hold the cards to stack.  
Cause you mean what you say.  
  
Sweet forgiveness, you help me see.  
I'm not near as bad,  
As I sometimes appear to be.  
When you hold me close,  
And you say, "That's all over,  
"And I still love you."  
  
There's no way that I could make up,  
For those angry words I said.  
Sometimes it gets to hurting,  
And the pain goes to my head.  
  
Sweet forgiveness, dear God above.  
I say we all deserve,  
A taste of this kind of love.  
Someone who'll hold our hand,  
And whisper, "I understand,  
"And I still love you."
