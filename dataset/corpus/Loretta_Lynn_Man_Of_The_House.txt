When the man of the house ain't never home  
Here I am again tonight all by myself  
It's not hard to figure out that you're out with someone else  
So this girl's gettin' ready gettin' sad to go wrong  
Cause the man of the house ain't never home  
When the man of the house ain't never home  
That's enough to cause most women to go wrong  
When you stagger in tonight and find me gone  
It's cause the man of the house ain't never home  
[ steel - piano ]  
You didn't think that I would ever slip and fall  
Well that's what you get forsaken and don't forget you caused it all  
And it gets pretty lonesome when you'll have to sleep alone  
When the man of the house ain't never home  
When the man of the house...  
No the man of the house ain't never home
