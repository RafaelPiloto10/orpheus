If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you  
Another night for me is just beginning soon the wine will wash away all my
shame  
With every drink one more mem'ry will leave me come closing time I won't feel
a thing  
Here I am on my way to the bottom it's a shame the things a man will do  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you  
  
It's been a long long time and I miss you but this world I'm living in won't
let me go  
And it's too late to say that I'm sorry and why I left you for this God only
knows  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle
