I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine  
Then to be at home alone and knowing' that you're gone  
Would cause me to lose my mind  
  
Well blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today  
I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back  
  
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine  
Then to be in some big city, in a small room, with you upon my mind  
  
[Chorus]
