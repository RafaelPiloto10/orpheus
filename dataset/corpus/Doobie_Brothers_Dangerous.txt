Pat simmons  
  
Come on over baby got nothin' to lose  
Well you never get enough o' those  
Highway blues  
Just another road to freedom and you know that  
It ain't no crime  
Can't you hear it baby  
Like thunder I know  
Like the magic and the passion  
Of rock and roll  
It's like a harley motorcycle baby raging out of control  
  
Danger up ahead of you  
Comin' up behind you too  
Turn it to the left  
Turn it to the right  
Now you twist the throttle up  
With all your might  
  
Dangerous, that's why you love it  
  
Well you like to drive fast baby  
Slide up right beside me watch the  
Broken lines fly  
'cause there's no one who can catch us  
Just let anybody give it a try  
Can't you hear it baby like thunder I know  
Like the magic and the passion of rock 'n' roll  
  
You're a rebel and youknow it  
And you're not afraid to throw it away
