It's awful hard to find a job  
On one side the government, the other the mob  
Hey, hey ain't that right  
The workin' man's in for a hell of a fight.  
  
Oh, this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin' apart at every nail.  
  
Way up on the old dew line  
Some of the boys were feelin' fine  
A big light flashed across the sky  
But somethin' else went slippin' by  
Meanwhile at the Pentagon  
The brass was a wonderin' what went wrong.  
  
Oh, this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin' apart at every nail.  
  
Hey hey, ain't that right  
The workin' man's in for a hell of a fight.  
  
Oh, this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin' apart at every nail.
