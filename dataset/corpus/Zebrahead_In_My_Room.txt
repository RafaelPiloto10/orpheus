I've got girls, they're in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
It's ten till two, the clock won't move  
Detention hall is better with beer  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do it all in my room  
I can be a rockstar with a bad attitude  
I am the king in my room  
I can ground my mom and dad if I choose  
  
Shapow!  
How do you like me now?  
Shazaam!  
I don't think you understand  
Shaquick!  
Hey, I got a ten inch, tv screen  
Only in my room  
  
I've got green, it's in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
Pitching tents inside my pants  
And there's a pool of drool by my ear  
  
I can take it all in my room  
I can be a quarterback and the coolest guy in school  
I can get on down in my room  
I can go and freak Rebecca Romijn in the nude  
  
[Chorus]
