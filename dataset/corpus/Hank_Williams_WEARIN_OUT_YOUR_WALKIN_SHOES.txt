Well, you can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em  
Yet there's something mighty necessary 'bout 'em  
A woman will give you the blues  
She'll have you pullin' out your hair  
And wearin' out your walkin' shoes  
Well they just keep naggin', until your head is saggin'  
There ain't a wink a-sleepin', when they startin' weepin'  
'Cause a woman will give you the blues  
She'll have you bitin' off your nails  
And wearin' out your walkin' shoes  
It's a losin' gamble, when you start to ramble  
Oh lordy, how you miss 'em, and you long to kiss 'em  
'Cause a woman will give you the blues  
She'll have you tossin' in your sleep  
And wearin' out your walkin' shoes  
Well you can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em  
It's better to talk with 'em, than to talk about 'em  
'Cause a woman will give you the blues  
She'll have you talkin' to yourself  
And wearin' out your walkin' shoes
