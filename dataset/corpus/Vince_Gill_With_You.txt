I can just see us now  
You and me paintin' the town  
Forever just foolin' around  
With you  
  
Just think of the things we'd do  
Baby just me and you  
My heart can finally be true  
With you  
  
[Chorus]  
With you  
And you with me  
Is all that I can see  
It ain't no mystery  
I long to always be  
With you  
With you  
I wanna be with you  
  
I see you in every dream  
Girl in my eyes you're queen  
My happiness you could bring  
With you  
  
So what are you waitin' on  
Just say the word and we're gone  
I'll be right where I belong  
With you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, darlin'  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll keep on callin'  
'Til you make my dream come true  
  
I can just see us now  
You and me paintin' the town  
Forever just foolin' around  
With you  
  
Just you  
Just you and me, baby  
I wanna be with you  
Just you, baby  
I wanna be with just you  
I wanna be  
I wanna be  
I wanna be with you, baby  
I wanna be with you  
Just you and me, baby
