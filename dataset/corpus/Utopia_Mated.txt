Everyone asks  
Are we some kind of lovers?  
Everyone asks what you're doing with me  
I know this is not what they want  
They're afraid you've been blinded  
But I already know how it's going to be  
If anyone should ask  
Say we're mated  
For as long as this life lasts  
We are mated  
Why else would you be here right now  
And you know we'll still be here tomorrow  
Nobody else understands what I'm doing  
Nobody else makes me act in this way  
And because they can't comprehend  
What we mean to each other  
They won't leave you alone  
So you know what to say  
I hold you in my heart  
'Cause we're mated  
In a very special part  
We are mated  
Why else would I be here right now  
And you know I'll still be here tomorrow  
I see things far ahead, maybe light  
Maybe beautiful children  
I don't have words I'm thinking of  
But it's way beyond what they call love
