Locked up tight but holdin' the key  
Clock keeps tickin' like it's laughin' at me  
I wonder what spell I'm under  
Days go by in a pulseless haze  
Who's that person that's wearin' my face  
Denyin' what he's hidin'  
I can't go on like this  
I won't let myself miss the rest of my life  
When something's come and gone, what good is holdin' on?  
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?  
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach  
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say  
I guess we could carry on livin' asleep  
Who is the fool who could choose to just keep pretendin'  
That this ain't endin'?  
I wish you all that I wish for myself  
To have that ache of emptiness behind us  
And not still inside us  
It's time to take that dare  
There's still a world out there waitin' for me  
When something's come and gone what good is holdin' on?  
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?  
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach  
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say  
We did the best we could  
Just like we thought we should  
But sometimes you've got to just let go  
When something's come and gone what good is holdin' on?  
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?  
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach  
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say, oh  
There's nothin' left to say, nothin' left to say  
There's nothin' left to say
