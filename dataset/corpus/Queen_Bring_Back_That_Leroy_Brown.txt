Big, bad Leroy Brown - he got no common sense  
No, no, he got no brains, but he sure gotta lot of style  
Can't stand no more in this, here, jail

Gotta get out of the heat, step into the shade  
Gotta get me there dead or alive, babe

Big mama Lulu Belle - she had a nervous breakdown  
She had a nervous breakdown  
Leroy's taken her honey child away  
But she met him down at the station, ooo-hoo  
Put a shotgun to his head, and, unless I be mistaken  
This is what she said  
  
Big bad big boy, big bad Leroy Brown  
I'm gonna get that cutie pie  
Bring back, bring back, bring back that Leroy Brown, yeah!  
Big bad caused a mighty fine sensation, yeah, yeah!  
Gone and got himself elected President  
We want Leroy for President  
  
Next time you gotta hit a bitty baddy weather  
This time like a shimmy shammy leather  
He's a big boy, bad boy Leroy  
I don't care where you get him from  
Bring that big, bad Leroy back  
Want him back
