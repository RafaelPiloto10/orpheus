It's only human to despise the weak  
It's only human to despise yourself when you're weak  
I don't know why  
But that's the way that it's always been  
And I play by the rules I don't understand at all  
  
It's only human to be lazy and vain  
It's only human to expect a world that's just as vain  
I don't know why  
I want to believe that it's not that way  
But I'm johnny come lately, it's not my place to say  
  
There's no escape, tell me why do they try so hard?  
And I pretend that I'm invincible, that I can go it all alone  
But I'm only human, trying to get by  
And praying to heaven I might find out why am I human  
Mere flesh and blood  
Afraid to go on without someone to hold me up  
  
It's just a human thing to fear the unknown  
But isn't it a tragic thing to live and die alone  
Oh lord look at the world,  
Have you ever seen so much misery?  
Like a ghost ship of fools, lost and floating out to sea  
  
And they climb and they fall  
Yet they struggle on the same fault  
But they're only human, trying to get by  
And praying to heaven they might find out  
Why are we human  
Mere flesh and blood  
We're afraid to go on without someone to hold us up
