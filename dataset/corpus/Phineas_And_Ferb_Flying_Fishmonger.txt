Holy Holy Mackerel (4x)  
He's bald on top  
He's got an artificial hip  
He's gonna take a hop  
He's gonna take a trip  
He's weak in the knees  
And he can't find his keys  
But put your hands together  
Cause he's here to please  
He's a Flying Fishmonger (Flying Fishmonger)  
He's a Flying Fishmonger (Death-defying wonder)  
He's a Flying Fishmonger with nerves of steel  
He's got an old bundle motor  
And a pair of wheels
