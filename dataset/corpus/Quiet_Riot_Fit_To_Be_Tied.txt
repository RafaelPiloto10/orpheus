What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied  
He tried to solve it, that was his only crime  
Well, I ain't got no inhibitions  
And my daddy gets left, alright  
The time for him to make the decision  
If this is still the place, I'm gonna spend the night  
He says, "get out, your no son of mine"  
What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied  
You don't understand, he thinks he's always right  
He says, your lust is the toy of confliction  
And you think you got fun all the time  
In school, you ain't got no direction  
He thinks I'm just a kid that ain't got no mind  
I say, "no way are you gonna run my life"  
What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied  
On my way, he pushed me over the line  
What a problem, I'm only one of a kind  
He says, "get out, your no son of mine"  
I say, "no way are you gonna run my life"  
Packed my bags, won't even say good-bye  
I'll show you a thing or two, you know I've got my pride  
What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied
