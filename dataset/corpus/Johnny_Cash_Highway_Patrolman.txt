My name is Joe Roberts I work for the State  
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks No 8  
I've always done an honest job honest as I could  
Got a brother named Frankie Frankie ain't no good  
Ever since we were young kids it's been the same come down  
I'd get a call on a short way Frankie's in trouble downtown  
But if it was any other man I'd put him straight away  
But sometimes when it's your brother you look the other way  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' nothin' feels better than blood on
blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no good  
Well Frankie went into the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we's gettin' robbed  
Frankie came home in '68 and me I took this job  
  
[Chorus]  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family ain't no friend of mine  
The night was like any other I got a call bout the quarter of nine  
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cryin' at a table it was Frankie she said  
I ran out and I jumped in my car then I hit the lights  
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night  
It was down by the crossroads out bout willow bank  
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till the sign said Canadian border five miles from here  
Pulled over to the south out the highway watched his taillights disappeared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family ain't no good
