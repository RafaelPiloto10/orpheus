I was looking back on my life  
And all the things I've done to me  
I'm still looking for the answers  
And I'm still searching for the key  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
Through all the happiness and sorrow  
I guess I'd do it all again  
Live for today and not tomorrow  
It's still the road that never ends  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
Ah ah, the road to nowhere's gonna pass me by  
Ah ah, I hope we never have to say goodbye  
I never want to live without you  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
Ah, the road to nowhere
