Nice car where'd ya get your ride  
A trophy? badge of honor? over compensation?  
Price tags! advertise yer pride  
Since when did what we paid for colored cloth  
Gage our gravity?  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Nice watch man d'ya got the time  
There's never enough and it always goes too slow  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Yeah you got'cha little world  
Picture perfect its a pearl  
Now go and try to sleep  
In the bed you made
