Some fellers like to tip-toe through the tulips,  
Some fellers go on singin' in the rain,  
Some fellers keep on painting skies with rainbows,  
Some fellers go on singin' down the lane.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
'Cause that's the kind of guy I'm,  
While other folks grow dizzy, I'll keep busy,  
Bidin' my time.  
  
Next year, Next year,  
Something's bound to happen,  
This year, this year,  
I'll just keep on nappin'.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
That's the kind of guy I'm,  
There's no regrettin' when I'm settin',  
Bidin' my time.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
That's the kind of guy I'm,  
While other grow dizzy, I'll keep busy,  
Bidin' my time.  
  
Next year, Next year,  
Something's bound to happen,  
This year, this year,  
I'll just keep on nappin'.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
That's the kind of guy I'm,  
There's no regrettin' when I'm settin',  
Bidin' my time.
