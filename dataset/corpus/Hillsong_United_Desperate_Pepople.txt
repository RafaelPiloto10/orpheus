Verse 1  
You crossed the great divide, you took out place  
You offered up your life though we had failed  
The veil was torn and love remained  
You are holy Lord  
  
Verse 2  
Distraction cost us, now we seek your face  
We offer up our lives to bring you praise  
A love that walls cannot contain  
You are holy Lord  
  
Pre-chorus  
Rising up in spirit and in truth  
A living sacrifice, we worship you  
A people undivided, Lord, hear us sing  
We are yours, and you are our King  
  
Chorus  
This is our love hearts joined as one, desperate for all you are  
Lord, break down these walls, and see how we love  
Desperate for all you are, we chase your heart  
  
Verse 3  
We didn't come to leave here entertained  
Worship under any other name  
We're crying out for you alone  
You are holy Lord  
  
Bridge  
Show us the way of your heart  
We find our voice, we found our voice  
We're on our knees, the carpets worn  
As we join our hearts with distant shores  
And sing to you, Lord
