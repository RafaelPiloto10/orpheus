Maybe it?s much too early in the game  
Ah, but I thought I?d ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year?s  
New Year?s Eve?  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it?s exactly twelve o?clock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Year?s Eve  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I?d ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You receive  
Ah, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
