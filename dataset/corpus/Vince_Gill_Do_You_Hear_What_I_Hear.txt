Do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear  
  
Said the night wind to the little lamb,  
Do you see what I see  
Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song, high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Everyone, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Celebrate the coming other king  
All my sisters, all my brothers  
Come together, love one another  
Join me now, every voice and sing  
Do You Hear What I Hear?  
(Traditional Christmas)  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace warm, mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
A Child, a child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light  
  
Everybody, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Everybody, come together  
Stay together, celebrate together  
Everybody, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Everybody, come together  
Stay together, celebrate together
