Jackie cane was everybody's sugar  
She gave it all wherever it took her  
They used her up before the sell-by date  
To be so sweet was her only mistake  
The only flower in a concrete garden  
Destined to be the rock that wouldn't harden  
Jackie cane was everybody's sugar  
She'd melt away if only she could of  
Taken for granted  
Abused and drained  
They ran her dry and  
Then it never rained  
She was the queen  
Of the 25th hour  
They looked so sweet  
But the after-taste was sour  
Salty days for Jackie Cane
