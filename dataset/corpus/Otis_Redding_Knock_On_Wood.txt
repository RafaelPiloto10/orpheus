I don't want to lose you, this good thing  
That I got 'cause if I do  
I will surely,  
Surely lose a lot.  
'Cause your love is better  
Than any love I know.  
  
It's like thunder and lightning,  
The way you love me is frightening.  
You better knock, knock on wood, baby.  
  
I'm not superstitious about ya  
But I can't take no chance.  
I got me spinnin', baby,  
You know I'm in a trance.  
'Cause your love is better  
Than any love I know.  
  
It's like thunder and lightning,  
The way you love me is frightening.  
You better knock, knock on wood, baby.  
  
It's no secret about it,  
That woman is my loving cup  
'cause she sees to it  
That I get enough.  
Just one touch from here,  
You know it means so much.
