I'll try to keep myself open up to you  
That's a promise that I made to love  
When it was new  
"Just like Jericho" I said  
"Let these walls come tumbling down"  
I said it like I finally found the way  
To keep the good feelings alive  
I said it like it was something to strive for  
  
I'll try to keep myself open up to you  
And approve your self expression  
I need that, too  
I need your confidence, baby  
And the gift of your extra time  
In turn I'll give you mine  
Sweet darling, it's a rich exchange  
It seems to me  
It's a warm arrangement!  
  
Anyone will tell you  
Just how hard it is to make and keep a friend  
Maybe they'll short sell you  
Or maybe it's you  
Judas, in the end  
When you just can no longer pretend  
That you're getting what you need  
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on  
  
I'll try to keep myself open up to you  
It gets easier and easier to do  
Just like Jericho  
Let these walls come tumbling down now  
Let them fall right on the ground  
Let all these dogs go running free  
The wild and the gentle dogs  
Kenneled in me
