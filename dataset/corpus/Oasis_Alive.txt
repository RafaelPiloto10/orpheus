The people will notice  
That the times are changing  
It's just time for now  
But not time for good it's my feelings  
That I think you're training  
Take them now  
If you think you should  
  
You want something for nothing  
The higher that you climb  
The longer you fall  
Maybe your time is coming  
Will you ask to climb  
When you find the wall  
Is it time to doubt?  
Is it time to wait?  
Will you be left alone  
At the starting gate  
I'm not blind  
And I do mind  
Coz I've had time  
now I'm alive  
  
The people have noticed  
That the times are changing  
But are they gonna  
Be something now I think I've seen you  
All hesitating I think I'll go  
And be something now  
  
You want something for nothing  
The higher that you climb  
The longer you fall  
Maybe your time is coming  
Will you ask to climb  
When you find the wall  
Is it time to doubt?  
Is it time to wait?  
Will you be left alone  
At the starting gate  
I'm not blind  
And I do mind  
Coz I've had time  
Now I'm alive  
  
Yeah I'm alive  
Now I'm alive  
Yeah I'm alive
