We're gonna have a good time  
Don't you ever listen to the radio  
When the big bad beat comes on  
I know you gotta dig it  
I know you can't stop it  
Cause the bottom comes on so strong  
  
Talkin 'bout (heavy music),

Dancin to that heavy music (music) What I sing to the heavy music (music)  
  
Yeah a little bit deeper now, alright  
Don't you ever feel like goin' insane  
When the drums begin to pound  
Ain't there ever been a time in your life  
You couldn't believe what the band is puttin' down, about
