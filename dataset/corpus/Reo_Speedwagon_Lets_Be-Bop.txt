Suddenly it happened,  
Here we are with all this glory  
We never thought for a minute,  
That we were writin a story  
We took our chances,  
Somehow we held it together  
And now I feel there is justice,  
I always new there was  
  
I love the warmth of the spotlight  
I need the sound of the people screamin'  
Here we are to bring down the ceiling  
Want to give you a real good feelin'  
Later on when it's over  
We will think of you and remember  
You're the ones who gave us the glory  
Just want to tell you that  
  
[Chorus]  
It's great to, to be with you  
Been a long time but we love you  
Don't stop, let's be-bop tonight  
  
Do you remember the last time?  
We remember the last time  
Everything was cool,  
We had a celebration, yeah  
We had a celebration,  
Let's bring the feeling back again  
Come on closer,  
Just got to tell ya that
