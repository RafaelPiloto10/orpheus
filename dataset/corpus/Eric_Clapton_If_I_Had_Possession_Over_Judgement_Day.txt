If I had possession over judgement day  
If I had possession over judgement day  
Lord, the little woman I'm lovin' wouldn't have no right to pray  
And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see  
And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see  
Man got my woman and the 'a lonesome blues got me  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
Boy, I woke up this mornin', my biscuit roller gone  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
I didn't like the way she done  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
And I said in my mind, yo' trouble gon' come someday  
And now run here, baby, set down on my knee  
Oh now run here, baby, set down on my knee  
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me
