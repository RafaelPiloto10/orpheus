Wu, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang, Tang  
  
The joy the flowers bring me  
The pain still has me sinking  
All while the heart gently weeps  
Your smell has got me shrinking  
The tears in your eyes are twinkling  
Because the heart gently weeps  
  
[Raekwon]  
Snowy night, fiends basing  
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing  
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off  
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck  
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck  
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two  
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl  
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent  
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding  
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut  
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies  
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib  
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her  
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess  
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her  
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us  
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart  
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's  
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar  
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark  
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down  
  
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound  
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim  
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again  
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby  
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though  
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...  
You better kill me... you know you're booty...  
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!  
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him  
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what it's all about  
Next thing you read in the paper "A man who came to kill, gets knocked out"  
  
[Chorus: Erykah Badu]  
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you  
Man's not supposed to cry...  
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy  
How tears of joy, bring so much life  
  
[Method Man]  
Yo aiyo yo yo yo  
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch  
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up  
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup  
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up  
He killed Kase and now he hassling us  
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up  
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block  
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot  
  
[Chorus]
