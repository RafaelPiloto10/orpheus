Go  
I've heard all I need to know  
Your voice in fucking echo stereo  
This particular scenario  
Looks like another all time low  
  
Why did you go and let them in  
See this is where the fun begins  
You barely even pierced the skin  
Just wait 'til you see what has come in  
  
Get down on the floor  
Shut the god damn door  
We'll do this all before  
They're coming back for more  
  
So give me just a little, baby  
Just something to get by  
It's gonna last forever, baby  
We'll get the other side  
And we will live forever, baby  
And stretch across the sky  
I'll follow right behind you, baby  
We're never gonna die  
  
Hey  
Everything is not okay  
We lost too much along the way  
The passengers are out today  
It looks as though they're here to stay  
This paranoia turns to fear  
This too is whispering in your ear  
Pretending but I know you hear  
That's how we fucking end up here  
  
So give me just a little, baby  
Just something to get by  
It's gonna last forever, baby  
We'll get the other side  
And we will live forever, baby  
And stretch across the sky  
I'll follow right behind you, baby  
We're never gonna die  
  
We're never gonna die  
How did we get so high  
  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky  
Stretch across the sky
