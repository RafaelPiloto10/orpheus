There's a devil waiting outside your door  
(How much longer?)  
There's a devil waiting outside your door  
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor  
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls  
There's a devil waiting outside your door  
He's weak with evil and broken by the world  
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more  
There's a devil waiting outside your door  
Loverman! since the world began  
Forever, amen till end of time take off that  
Dress I'm coming down I'm your loverman  
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am  
  
L is for love, baby  
O is for only you that I do  
V is for loving virtually all that you are  
E is for loving almost everything that you do  
Are is for rape me  
M is for murder me  
A is for answering all of my prayers  
N is for knowing your loverman's going to  
  
Be the answer to all of yours  
Loverman! till the bitter end  
While empires burn down forever and ever  
And ever and ever amen I'm your loverman  
So help me, baby so help me  
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am  
I'll be your loverman!  
There's a devil crawling along your floor  
There's a devil crawling along your floor  
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door  
With his straining sex in his jumping paw  
There's a devil crawling along your floor  
And he's old and he's stupid and  
He's hungry and he's sore  
And he's lame and he's blind  
And he's dirty and he's poor  
I've him more  
There's a devil crawling along your floor  
Loverman! here I stand forever, amen  
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am  
Forgive me, baby my hands are tied  
And I got no choice no, I got no choice at all  
I'll say it again  
  
L is for love, baby  
O is for o yes I do  
V is for virtue, so I ain't gonna hurt you  
E is for even if you want me to  
Are is for render unto me, baby  
M is for that which is mine  
A is for any old how, darling  
N is for any old time  
  
I'll be your loverman! I got a masterplan  
To take off your dress and be your man  
Seize the throne seize the mantle  
Seize the crown cause I am what I am  
What I am what I am I'm your loverman!  
There's a devil lying by your side  
You might think he's asleep  
Take a look at his eyes  
He wants you, baby, to be his bride  
There's a devil lying by your side  
Loverman! loverman!
