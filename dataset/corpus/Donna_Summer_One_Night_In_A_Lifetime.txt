There's more to question than answers  
and sand will slip through your hands  
and love is faster than lightning  
so grab it while you can mm, mm, mm...  
  
Well I've been searching forever  
between the bad and the good  
but now I know what I'm missing  
and I wanna make it with you  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and babe it's gotta be tonight  
babe it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it should be tonight  
baby it should be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one night, one night, one night  
in a lifetime, one night  
  
They say that love is a gamble  
and luck will play a trick or two  
but I'll risk all of my loving  
I'd put my last buck on you  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
Baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
Baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one night, one night, one night  
in a lifetime, one night  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it should be tonight  
baby it should be tonight
