Everything went wrong  
I'm sorry boys I've got to  
Let you go  
We've had some hard times and  
The long rain, it didn't show  
Hired hands I've seen them  
Come and go  
But you don't come much better  
Today's blue Monday I just got  
A bad news letter  
  
This day has come  
The darkest cloud on our horizon  
My hands are tied down to that  
Promise note I signed upon  
Always been this way  
It's the poor man who gets hurt  
All you ever work for is to leave  
Your footprints in the dirt  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
The deed is done  
The fruit will fall  
To someone else's hand  
That's how the land lies  
Now we all know where  
We stand  
You'll have to walk away  
Don't let them see you running  
Today's Blue Monday, I should  
Have seen it coming  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
If sweat and tears were  
All it took  
To make this valley green  
We'd be alright but now it's  
Gone they've taken everything  
They say it's just an act of God  
And that's the way  
I'll wind blows  
You've got thirty days  
To pack your bags  
Say goodbye, hit the road  
  
You work your fingers to the bone
