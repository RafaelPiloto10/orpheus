If you're alone and you need a friend  
Someone to make you forget your problems  
Just come along baby  
Take my hand  
I'll be your lover tonight  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
  
This is what I wanna do  
Let's have some fun  
What I want is me and you  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I want you in my room  
Let's spend the night together  
  
From now until forever  
Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna go boom boom  
Let's spend the night together  
Together in my room  
  
Everybody get on down  
The Vengaboys are back in town  
  
This is what I wanna do  
Let's have some fun  
What I want is me and you  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I want you in my room  
Let's spend the night together  
From now until forever  
Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna go boom boom  
Let's spend the night together  
Together in my room  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I want you in my room  
Let's spend the night together  
From now until forever  
Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna go boom boom  
Let's spend the night together  
Together in my room  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I want you in my room  
Let's spend the night together  
From now until forever
