Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, are you feeling like me too?  
I need to get an answer out of you, well  
All the days  
All the time  
All the lies lie on the line  
Did you just try to set me off? well  
Yeah ya know I'm easy  
And I know it's true  
That this situation  
Isn't so easy on you  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, Is there truth behind your lies?  
Is all this love  
Or is it compromise? well  
All the days  
All the time  
No regrets you're on my mind  
Did you just try to set me off? well  
Yeah this awkward silence  
Feels so cold and used  
Is this infatuation  
Or am I addicted to you?  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Re-re-re-reverse the beat  
Back up direction  
Tries and trust and planned out deception  
The look in your eyes  
Verbal dissection  
Lose myself in you  
And then sex then rejection  
Self destruct in you arms  
As your words stacks kill  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, are you feeling lonely too?  
I need to get some answers, some answers  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?
