All to Jesus I surrender  
All to Him I freely give  
I will ever love and trust Him  
In His presence daily live  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
All to Jesus I surrender  
At Thy feet I humbly bow  
Worldly pleasures all forsaken  
Take me, Jesus, take me now  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
All to Jesus I surrender  
Lord, I give myself to Thee  
Fill me with Thy love and power  
Let Thy blessing fall on me  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all, I surrender all, I surrender all
