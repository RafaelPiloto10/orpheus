He was born a sailors son  
Nothing came easy or free  
He suffered the squalls all the rises and falls  
And everything else in between  
But he says storms always fade after they've had their way  
They're never as bad as they seem  
  
as long as the rivers still run to the seas  
Hey lucky you, lucky me  
  
who'd ever thought for a moment  
She'd have to grow up so fast  
School beauty queen with a child at sixteen  
Swore that her fortunes had passed  
But blessings can hide in the strangest disguise  
I know that she would agree  
  
Hey look at me in the spotlight  
Ripped jeans and rock and roll hair  
Feeling so cool but I'd be such a fool  
Singing to no one out there  
So hey take a bow every band needs a crowd  
And I've got a song we can sing
