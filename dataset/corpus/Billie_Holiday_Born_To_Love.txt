There's something that rules our destiny  
Right from the first day of our birth  
although you may not care for me  
You have your mission on this earth  
You were born to love  
Sure as you live  
Born with everything heaven could give  
You have eyes and they express  
Love at a glance  
You have lips who's tenderness  
Speak of romance  
Like a dream of love, lovely to see  
You're the angel of my destiny  
And to think that you have found  
Your place on earth only to be  
Born to love and be loved by me
