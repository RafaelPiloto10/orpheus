It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around you  
It's everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take each other's love  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around me  
The more I am, the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh no, no, no, no, no  
Yeah, hey, hey, hey  
All right  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around you  
It's everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take each other's love  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around me  
The more I am, the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much
