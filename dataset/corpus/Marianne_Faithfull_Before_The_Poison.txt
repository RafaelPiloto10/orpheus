Before the poison, I wasn't down  
If you'd been there, if you'd been around  
I couldn't hear, couldn't hear a sound  
I was floating above the ground  
  
Before the poison, I had lost my fear  
Maybe too happy to even care  
Safe in my dream, couldn't see the fog  
Comin' on, coming from nowhere, my name to call  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end, what's left for you, my friend?  
  
Before the poison, I'd laugh out loud  
I'd see your face in any crowd  
But speak softly without fear  
Hold on to me, hold me near  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end, what's left for you, my friend?  
  
What's left for you, my friend?  
What's left for you, my friend?  
What's left for you?
