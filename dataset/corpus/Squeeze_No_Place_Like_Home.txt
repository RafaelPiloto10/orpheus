I'm faced with the facts  
And a fist full of threats  
I stand quite amused  
At the end of the bed  
I have no defense  
For what I have said  
As a handful of love  
Whacks me right round the head  
She's growling and stalking  
And grabs from a pile  
A book that she throws  
And it missed by a mile  
I'm holding a pillow  
And as naked as sin  
I'm backed to a corner  
With a wastepaper bin  
Then up on the mattress  
There's no place to go  
I'm guilty yes guilty  
But there's no place like home  
  
I rewind the hours  
To see what went wrong  
I plead for forgiveness  
And I'm hit like a gong  
It seems that I'm guilty  
Of smiling too long  
When recalling lovers  
That now are long gone  
I'm guilty you're guilty  
So let me be stoned  
The past is the present  
When there's no place like home  
  
Off with the shoes  
And a whack round the head  
Your ear rings like a phone  
Some explanation  
Might patch and mend  
A love that's lost control  
Now there's no place like home
