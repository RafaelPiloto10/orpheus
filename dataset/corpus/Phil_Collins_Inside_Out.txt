Inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out  
  
Now everybody keeps on telling me how to be  
And everybody tells me do what they say  
Oh I'll help myself it's up to me and no-one else  
But till I'm ready just keep out of my way  
  
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out  
  
Now everybody's got me running round, up and down  
And here I am going out of my mind  
But I won't lose sight of all the, the things I'm looking for  
They're coming to me and I'm taking what's mine  
  
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out  
  
I'll play the game  
We'll make the same mistakes  
It's all the same  
If we can give and take  
Hold on, hold on, ooh  
Hold on, hold on, ooh  
  
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out  
  
All of my life I've been searching and hanging on  
Turning a corner, never know what I'd find  
But now I'm back again like I never went away  
Ooh let me in I'm through with wasting my time  
  
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out  
Oh inside out, ooh you got me inside out  
Oh inside out, oh inside out
