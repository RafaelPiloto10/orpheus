Redeemer of Soul  
Time to settle the score  
He's loaded to feel their remorse  
Steadfast strong that's for sure  
The deal of his life takes it's course  
No giving in  
They don't understand  
They get to give up and to meet his demands  
  
Count down coming your way  
He's the last to obey  
Watch him seizing the day  
Redeemer - redeemer of souls  
  
There's no holding him back  
The ransom announces his deeds  
He's not cutting you slack  
Just taking what ever he needs  
Diamonds for eyes  
As he begins  
On that two wheeler from hell on the wind  
  
Now he's setting the tune  
They know the stare down is soon  
Vengeance comes at high noon  
Redeemer of souls  
On the skyline  
The stranger draws near  
Feel the heat and he's shaking with fear  
  
Countdown coming your way  
He's the last to obey  
Watch him seizing the day  
Redeemer of souls
