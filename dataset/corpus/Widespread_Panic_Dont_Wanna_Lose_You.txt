Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
You know, I can't see straight  
And I'm feelin' dizzy  
  
I can't feel my face  
Against the hard wood floor  
  
I'm gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I would lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
I had dreams last night  
While you still were sleeping  
I can see my faith  
Runnin' out the backdoor  
I'm going to tell you right now  
Like it's the very last day  
  
And I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I will lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
I'm gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I would lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you
