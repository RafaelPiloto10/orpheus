I got shoes, you got shoes  
All of God's children got shoes my Lord  
And when we get to Heaven, gonna put on our shoes  
We're gonna walk, we're gonna talk  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven  
I got a robe, you got a robe  
All of God's children got a robe my Lord  
And when we get to Heaven, gonna put on our robes  
We're gonna shout, we're gonna shout  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven  
Heaven, Heaven, everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven  
Ain't goin' there Heaven, Heaven  
Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven, ain't goin' there  
Well, I'm gonna walk, I gonna talk  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven
