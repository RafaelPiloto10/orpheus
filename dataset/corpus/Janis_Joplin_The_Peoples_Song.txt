My hands are tied behing my back my face is red with hate  
I know I've tried to be the better man but I can't accept this fate  
  
It's seems every time I cross the line and wonder that  
Am supposed to figure which way you want to go  
And I can see that misery is plaguing you  
And I'm supposed to be there when you have no one  
  
Take my hand i'll take from where you stand  
My mind is made up and I can't take the people falling  
Down on me but that's the way it's gotta be  
(our 2 worlds can't coexist)  
I can't promote a lie that I wanna watch you crying
