I get up in the evening, and I ain't got nothing to say  
I come home in the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way  
I ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself  
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Message just keep getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round my place  
I check my look in the mirror wanna change my clothes my hair my face  
Man I ain't getting nowhere I'm just livin in a dump like this  
There's something happening somewhere baby I just know that there is  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You sit around getting older there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me  
I'll shake this world off my shoulders come on baby the laughs on me  
Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up alright  
They say you got to stay hungry hey baby I'm just about starving tonight  
I'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write  
This book  
I need a love reaction come on baby give me just one look  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, sittin' 'round cryin' over a broken heart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
You can't start a fire, worryin' about your little world falling apart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Hey baby!
