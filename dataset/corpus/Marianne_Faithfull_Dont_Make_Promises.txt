It seems the songs we're singing  
Are all about tomorrow,  
Tunes of promises that we can't keep.  
Every moment bringing  
A love I can only borrow,  
You're telling me lies in your sleep.  
  
Do you think I'm not aware  
Of what you're saying  
Or why you're saying it?  
Is it hard to keep me where  
You want me staying?  
Don't go on betraying.  
  
Don't make promises that you can't keep.  
  
We had a chance to find it,  
Our time was now or never,  
You promised me things that I need.  
And then the things behind it  
Took away the chance forever,  
You're telling me lies in your sleep.  
  
Do you think I'm not aware  
Of what you're saying  
Or why you're saying it?  
Is it hard to keep me where  
You want me staying?  
Don't go on betraying.  
  
Don't make promises that you can't keep.  
Don't make promises that you can't keep.  
Don't make promises that you can't keep.  
Don't make promises that you can't keep....
