I can hear your thoughts  
Like footsteps in the dark  
The pain stirs in your voice  
Cuts like daggers to my heart  
  
Don't you be afraid  
Baby I'm here  
Stop running from love  
Baby don't you fear  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Play the simple game  
With all your broken rules  
I'm calling out your name  
But my heart just still refuses  
  
Don't you be afraid  
Baby I'm here  
Stop running from love  
Baby don't you fear  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words
