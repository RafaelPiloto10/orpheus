Didn't I say  
I wasn't ready for romance?  
Didn't we promise  
We would only be friends?  
And so we danced  
Though it was only a slow dance,  
I started breaking my promises right there and then  
  
Didn't I swear  
There would be no complications?  
Didn't you want  
Someone who's seen it all before?  
Now that you're here  
It's not the same situation,  
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
I've been around  
Someone like me should know better  
Falling in love  
Would be the worst thing I could do  
Didn't I say  
I needed time to forget her?  
Aren't you running  
From someone who's not over you?  
  
How many nights  
Have I been lonely without you?  
I tell myself  
How much I really don't care  
How many nights  
Have I been thinking about you?  
Wanting to hold you  
But knowing you would not be there  
  
But this night you're mine  
It's only you and I  
I'll tell you to forget yesterday  
This night we are together  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
This night  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Tomorrow is such a long time away  
This night can last forever
