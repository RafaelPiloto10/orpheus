Anytime, anytime you want me, honey, just let me know.  
When you need affection, and you're looking for somewhere to go,  
I'll be home, 'round the house just waiting, waiting for your call.  
I mean anytime you want me, anytime at all.  
Don't be ashamed to let me know you love me, that's such a silly thing to do,  
'Cause anytime, you call me, baby, I'll come running straight to you.  
I'll be there beside you even if I have to crawl,  
Anytime you want me, I'm saying, anytime at all.  
(I'll be there beside you even if I have to crawl,)  
Anytime you want me, I mean, anytime at all.
