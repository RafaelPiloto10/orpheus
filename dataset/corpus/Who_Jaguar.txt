Grace, space, race  
Everything they've seen you have seen,  
Everywhere they've been you have been,  
Everything they've done you have been and done already.  
  
Every lovely spot near or far,  
You can reach them too in your car,  
Or you might be there now if you own a jag already.  
  
The radio blasting, the girls are glancing,  
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials.  
  
Grace space race.  
Grace space race.  
Jaguar, jaguar, jaguar, jaguar.
