Had my money  
I tell you what I'd do  
I would go downtown  
Buy a Mercury or two  
Cause I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
I'm goin' to buy me a Mercury  
And I'll cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
  
You know that gal I love  
I stole her from a friend  
Fool got lucky stole her back again  
Because she knowed he had a Mercury  
Cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
Well, she knowed he had a Mercury  
And she cruise up and down this road  
  
Hey now mama  
Where'd you stay last night  
Your hair's all down  
Your clothes don't fit you right  
Had my money  
I tell you what I'd do  
Go downtown and buy a Mercury or two  
Cause I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
And I'll cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
  
I'm going to buy me a Mercury  
And I'll cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
  
I'm going to buy me a Mercury  
Going to buy me a Mercury  
Going to buy me a Mercury  
Cruise, cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road  
  
I'm going to buy me a Mercury  
Buy me a Mercury  
Going to buy me a Mercury  
Cruise, cruise up and down this road  
Up and down this road
