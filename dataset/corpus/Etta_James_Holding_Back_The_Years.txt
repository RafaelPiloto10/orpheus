Holding back the years  
Thinking of the fear I've had so long  
When somebody hears  
Listen to the fear that's gone  
  
Strangled by the wishes of pater  
Hoping for the arm of mater  
Get to me sooner or later  
Nothing ever could, yeah  
  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'll keep holding on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(Keep holding on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(Never let you go away)  
I'll keep holding on  
  
Holding back the years  
Chance for me to escape from all I know  
Holding back the tears, yeah  
There's nothing here has grown  
  
I've wasted all my tears  
Wasted all those years  
Nothing had the chance to be good  
Nothing ever could, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright  
  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'm gon' keep holding on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(Holding and holding and holding)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'll keep holding, babe)  
I'll keep holding on  
(So tight)  
  
I wasted all my tears  
Wasted all those precious years  
Nothing had the chance to be good  
Nothing ever could, yeah, yeah and I'll  
  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'm gonna hold on, babe)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'm gonna hold, hold, hold, hold on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(Can't let you go)  
  
I'll keep holding on  
(I keep holding and holding and holding on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I can't let you go for nobody)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'm gonna keep holding and holding, baby)  
  
I'll keep holding on  
(I, I)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'll keep holding, holding on)  
I'll keep holding on  
(I'll keep holding on)
