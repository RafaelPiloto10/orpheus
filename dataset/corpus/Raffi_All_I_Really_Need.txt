All I really need is a song in my heart  
Food in my belly and love in my family  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
And love in my family  
  
And I need the rain to fall  
And I need the sun to shine  
To give life to the seeds we sow  
To give the food we need to grow, grow

Food in my belly and love in my family  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
And love in my family  
  
And I need some clean water for drinking  
(Drinking)  
And I need some clean air for breathing

And take my place where I belong
