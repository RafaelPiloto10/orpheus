A lifelong list of Sundays, wrapped up with a bow  
Justifies the greatest answers, that you may never know  
The fallen is the viper, reap now what you sow  
Screaming from the mountain tops, let his people go  
He's down, in hot damnation,  
So down like you'll never know  
Going down to sweet temptation  
Let his people go  
  
In the eternal brood of liar  
In the catastrophic fold  
Count yourself amongst them  
The goal is your soul  
On the other side of sanity  
Where the goodness dare not go  
Count yourself amongst them  
The goal is your soul  
  
A lifelong list of blessings, didn't go too far  
And all the instinct you were given, wishing on that star  
The fallen have your hope and love, the viper never trust  
Know they are exchangeable, as you clean away the dust  
He's down, in hot damnation,  
So down you'll never know  
Going down to sweet temptation  
Let his people go  
  
All forgiveness flying, screams to fill the air  
A lifelong full of blessings rendered, didn't work out fair  
All forgiveness lying, screams to fill the hole  
A lifelong full -- of blessings given  
And the goal is still your soul
