I should've known you couldn't take it  
You had to make it with another man  
You know that's true, baby  
And I can play that game if you can  
It's been a long time since I've come here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
And you know that silver dollar, it would make me rich  
Girl like you, easy pitch  
But I miss you now you're gone  
I'm coming home, girl, just to show you  
What this man's been living for  
A tip for you, don't be surprised, baby  
When I come busting through that door  
It's been a long time since I've been here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
And even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know you're gone  
And all I got left is my old guitar  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
Even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know you're gone
