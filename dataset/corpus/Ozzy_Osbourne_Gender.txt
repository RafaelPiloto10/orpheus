I wish I was infinite and given my way  
I'd be so fucking cool  
When i'm feeling the rush  
I look at you through different eyes.  
I never knew my thoughts televise what you think  
I'm the twin inside you  
  
Its hard to believe what you say  
Uaccepting what you've tried to show us  
And nothing can fix what's incomplete  
Cant get to us never get to us  
  
Refreshing memories of times we've known  
Constantly stumbling over reason where do these words go  
Now so true covering no one esle but you  
Stepping up to freak the day  
Devour every modern day  
  
Fell awake in my dizziness  
I'm blinding  
I wish I was obedient  
Arent I something  
I'll never be rational  
I'm finding my way to everyone in this velvet sky of mine  
  
  
Boredom does nothing for me  
So why does it follow  
Walking with the deadbeats down the street  
I want everything  
  
I'll be your idol  
Be your maker  
Your everything  
Your dirty dream designer  
Be your everything
