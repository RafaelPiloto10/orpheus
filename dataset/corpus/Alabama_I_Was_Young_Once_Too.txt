He raced that engine down the track  
'Round the tree on Christmas day  
I was so amazed Dad could play with trains  
I saw a sparkle in his eye  
Then I heard him say  
I was young once too, I was young once too  
  
He washed that Buick faithfully  
Lord, he kept her clean  
I thought that machine  
Meant more to him than me  
On the day I turned sixteen  
He threw me the keys  
Said I was young once too, I was young once too  
  
He was such a young man then  
I'm older than that now  
I hope I measure up to him  
When the circle comes around  
  
I caught him in the attic  
Cross legged on the floor  
With some old photographs  
He pointed and he laughed  
He said that's me in that picture  
I said, "No son, that's your dad"  
I was young once too, I was young once too  
I was young once too, I was young once too
