A one two a one two, yeah yeah  
I'd like to introduce to you  
Wyclef jean with gloria estefan  
When the cubans meet the haitians and sicilians  
  
Hold your corner, hold your corner  
For all the thugs who've ever been in love  
Hey, yo, this one goes out for the Cuban kings and queens  
You ever fell in love with a pretty serpentine?  
  
I met her at the club, yes down with my pager  
Asked her what's her name, she said, Gloria  
Where you from?, Cuba  
What do you do?, I'm a singer  
  
I pulled out my stash  
She said: are you a dealer from Havana?  
No, no  
Yo, can I buy you a tequila?  
  
She said: hell no, I'll take a pina colada  
Now with one drink, I'll put her in a spell  
I'm huntin' the kid  
Like a cheetah hunts a gazelle  
  
I know it's wrong, but I'm waiting for her mistake  
So I can take over like the devil's advocate  
  
Please don't release me, don't release me  
From this spell you got me under  
Please don't release me, don't release me  
From this spell you got me under  
  
I can't let go, I can't let go  
Got to hold on to you, baby  
Got to hold on to you now  
Ooh, you make me feel like I could lose control  
  
I'm gonna lose it right now  
I want to show you what love can do  
You know I feel like I am walking in the clouds  
And I don't want to come down  
  
I can't let go, oh no  
Please don't release me, don't release me  
From this spell you got me under  
I can't let go, I can't let go  
  
Got to hold on to you, baby  
Got to hold on to you now  
  
Show me how to find the way to paradise  
You can take me there  
I want to be the only lover in your life  
Ooh baby, don't release me  
  
I got this feelin' that I can't explain  
Don't you know I feel like I could rise above the ground  
Don't want to come down  
Please don't release me, don't release me  
  
From this spell you got me under  
I can't let go, I can't let go  
Got to hold on to you, baby  
Got to hold on to you now
