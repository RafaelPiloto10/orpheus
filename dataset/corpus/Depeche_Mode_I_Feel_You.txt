I feel you, your sun, it shines.  
I feel you within my mind.  
You take me there, you take me where the kingdom comes.  
You take me to, and lead me through Babylon.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
  
I feel you, your heart, it sings.  
I feel you, the joy it brings.  
Where heaven waits, those golden gates, and back again.  
You take me to, you lead me through oblivion.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
I feel you, your precious soul, and I am whole.  
I feel you, your rising sun, my kingdom comes.  
  
I feel you, each move you make.  
I feel you, each breath you take.  
Where angels sing and spread their wings my love's on high.  
You take me home to glory's throne by and by.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.
