[MRS. SOWEBERRY (spoken)]  
Right then, Oliver Twist,  
Your bed's underneath the counter.  
You don't mind sleeping  
Among coffins I suppose?  
It don't much matter whether you do  
Or you don't cause you can't sleep  
Nowhere else!  
  
[OLIVER]  
Where is love?  
Does it fall from skies above?  
Is it underneat the willow tree  
That I've been dream of?  
Where is she?  
Who I close my eyes to see?  
Will I ever know the sweet "hello"  
That's only meant for me?  
Who can say where she may hide?  
Must I travel far and wide?  
'Til I am bedside the someone who  
I can mean somethin to...  
Where... ?  
Where is love?  
  
Who can say where... she may hide?  
Must I travel... far and wide?  
'Til I am beside... the someone who  
I can mean... something to...  
Where?  
Where is love?
