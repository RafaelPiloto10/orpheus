There in the shadows, looks like a hand  
Without its owner, to give it a command  
It's got a purpose but I don't know what it is  
I'm in trouble  
  
There in the streets, looks like a man  
But something wrong that I don't understand  
His eyes are open but he don't see a thing  
His skin is peeling off, his bones are sticking out  
I'm getting scared  
  
Oh my god (Is it dead?)  
Is it living? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead or alive?  
(Is it dead?), Is it dead? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead or alive?  
  
Hiding in the cupboards, like little mice  
Hiding in the frigerator, that isn't nice  
It's not an animal, it don't have legs  
No one else can see it  
  
It moves so fast, corner of my eye  
Look again it's gone, it's hiding  
Won't somebody help me, doesn't anybody care?  
It waits so patiently, for me to lose my guard  
I'm getting scared  
  
Is it dead, is it  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead or alive  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead, is it  
  
I remember there was a time  
When dead and buried meant just that  
Underneath the cold dark ground  
Things stay put!  
  
Oh them bones they make them bodies walk  
Them bones, them bones  
If they could only talk!  
  
Is it dead
