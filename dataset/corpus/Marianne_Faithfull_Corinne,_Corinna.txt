Corrina, Corrina, gal where you been so long?  
Corrina, Corrina, gal where you been so long?  
I've been worryin' about you, baby, baby, please come home  
  
I got a bird that whistles, I got a bird that sings  
I got a bird that whistles, I got a bird that sings  
But I ain't a-got Corrina, life don't mean a thing  
  
Corrina, Corrina, gal you're on my mind  
Corrina, Corrina, gal you're on my mind  
I was in love thinkin' of you, I just can't keep from cryin'
