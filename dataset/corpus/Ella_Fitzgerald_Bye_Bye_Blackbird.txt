Pack up all my care and woe  
Here I go, singing low  
Bye-bye, blackbird  
  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar's sweet and so is he  
Bye, bye, blackbird  
  
No one here can love and understand me  
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me  
Make my bed, light the light, I'll arrive late tonight  
Blackbird, toot-a-lou  
  
Here I go, sing a little bye, blackbird  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar's sweet and so is he  
Bye, blackbird  
  
No one here can love and understand me  
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me  
You'd better make my bed  
And light the light, I'll arrive late tonight  
Blackbird, bye-bye, goodbye  
  
So long blackbird, bye-bye  
Bye
