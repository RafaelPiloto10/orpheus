I hear footsteps slowly walking,  
As they gently walk across a lonely floor,  
And a voice is softly saying,  
Darling, this will be good-bye for ever more.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
There goes my reason for living,  
There goes the one of my dreams,  
There goes my only possession,  
There goes my everything.  
  
As my memory turns back the pages,  
I can see the happy years we had before,  
Now the love that kept this old heart beating,  
Has been shattered by the closing of the door.
