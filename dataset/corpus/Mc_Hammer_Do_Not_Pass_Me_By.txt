Pass me not, oh, gentle Savior  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
I've got the feelin' and the feelin's not the same  
I did the hip hop, a little Hammer and the James  
But a touch, a touch from up above  
And I get the feelin', the feelin' of Your love  
Reachin' out, callin' for Your people  
(Reachin' out)  
To keep us all safe from a world that's full of evil  
Tryin', cryin', Lord, sometimes I'm cryin  
When I think of His gifts and the world just keeps denying  
When I think of His goodness  
And what He's done for me  
My soul cries, Hallelujah  
Thanks for savin' me, sing  
Savior, Savior, why don't You  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
(Dance break?)  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I don't want the Lord to pass me by  
I, I need Him at home  
At work, at school  
Do you need Him?  
I know you need Him  
While the others Thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
Do not pass me by
