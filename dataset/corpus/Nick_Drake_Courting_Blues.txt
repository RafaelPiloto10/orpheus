Green are your eyes  
In the morning, when you rise  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Love, don't cry  
I'll never try  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Green are your eyes  
In the morning, when you rise  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day
