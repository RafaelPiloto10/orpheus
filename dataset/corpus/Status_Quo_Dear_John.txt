Everybody was talking to me  
Like I was a child  
In their words I could hear them saying  
It's just a matter of time  
Anyway it's a long long race been run  
Anyway it's a sad sad song been sung  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Vanity is hard old lady  
You can't read her mind  
I'm a fool but I don't fool easy  
While you're foolin' around  
Anyway I can hold my own tonight  
I admit I was wrong and you where right  
  
Dear John Goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Everybody was talking to me  
Like I was a child  
In their words I could hear them saying  
It's just a matter of time  
Anyway it's a long long race been run  
Anyway it's a sad sad song been sung  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes..
