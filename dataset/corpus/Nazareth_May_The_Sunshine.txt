May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Someone woke me up again last night  
Talkin' to me about my last time  
Don't tell me I know it's late  
Please, please lay me down a line  
Pick me up before I start to fall  
Never let your dreams grow small  
  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Talkin' to my lover, she was out  
It was independence day  
Don't be nervous , you can hold me tight  
Someone turned the light out on the stairs  
Was it just the wind I heard  
Just another helping hand  
  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Take me back down the yellow brick road  
Let me get my ticket to your heart  
Stranger's hidin' on my land  
Could it be it's keepin' me apart  
Give me time don't you gimme no love  
Let the sunshine in your heart  
  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun, the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you
