I Think I See Gold  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
I see you struggling every day  
You think, How long  
Can I go on this way?  
On and on  
Again and again  
Oh, when will it end?  
You think, I just can't go on  
Much longer  
But inside, my friend,  
Your faith is growing stronger  
You feel the fire burning  
Deep in your soul  
But I want you to know  
Chorus:  
I think I see gold  
I think I see gold in the fire  
Right there in the ashes  
Is all you've desired  
Oh, it's hard  
As you press toward the goal  
Don't give up  
Don't give in  
Don't stop now  
I think I see gold  
Until this moment  
You've always believed  
When life grew darkest  
By faith you could see  
Open your eyes  
Look for the light  
You see, you were right  
These lonely hours  
Like a fire refining  
Something that's precious  
Something that's shining  
There in the darkness  
Surrounded by coals  
Is starting to glow  
Chorus
