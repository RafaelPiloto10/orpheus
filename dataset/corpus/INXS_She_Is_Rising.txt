Those pretty feet are stuck deep in the ground  
And all that junk keeps coming  
Must be the time to rearrange it all  
Another place another time has called  
She is rising above this world  
She is heading for an open door  
She is rising above this world  
She is heading for an open door  
  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants, is to begin  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants is to begin  
  
One day he wakes up to a different drum  
Rhythm coming from so far away  
He had no time to tell anyone  
His hips were moving to a perfect sway  
  
He is rising above this world  
He is heading for an open door  
He is rising above this world  
He is heading for an open door  
  
Give it up let him in  
All he wants is to begin  
Give it up let him in  
All he wants is to begin  
  
Give it up let her in  
All she want's is to begin  
  
She is rising above this world  
She is heading for an open door  
  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants is to begin  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants is to begin  
  
Give it up let him in (she is rising, he is rising)  
All he wants is to begin (all I want is to begin)  
Give it up let him in (she is rising, he is rising)  
All he wants is to begin (all he wants is to begin)  
  
She is rising  
He is rising  
All I want all I want is to begin  
He is rising  
She is rising  
  
Give it up  
  
We are rising  
  
She is rising  
She is rising
