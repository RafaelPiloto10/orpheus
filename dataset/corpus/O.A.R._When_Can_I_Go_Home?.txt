I wrote a letter to man, sealed my envelope with hope and a stamp  
Give me a minute and I'll be on my way  
Cause I got something for y'all today  
Well I was walking yesterday, I gave you a smile and then you turned  
I said nothing cause that's all that I could say  
I said nothing cause that's all that I could say  
Give it back to me  
Let me go, let me go, let me go home  
Well I was thinking yesterday, about what I would do and maybe what I would
say  
If I had that minute, if I had it back today  
Cause I got something for y'all today  
Give it back to me  
Let me go, let me go, when can I go, when can I go home?  
You find yourself by alone  
Wondering what to do so you pick up the phone  
But she doesn't say a thing and she isn't even home  
But that's okay because you're on your own  
Let me go, let me go, when can I go home?
