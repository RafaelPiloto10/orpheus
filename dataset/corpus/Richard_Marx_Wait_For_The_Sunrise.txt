I was born an only son  
Didn't take to the rules, like a normal child  
Prisoner of the things I've done  
It's the price you pay livin' fast and wild  
  
[Chorus]  
I've spent too many nights lookin' over my shoulder  
And the ways of the world make a heart grow colder  
Got nowhere left to hide  
The fight in me has died  
So I must wait for the sunrise  
  
Friend to fear and loaded gun  
Live life like the owner of a heart of stone  
No one touches, touch no one  
But the road gets wary when you're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much done to undo  
No one I can run to  
I need one more chance to live my life again  
  
[Chorus]
