I would lock you up  
But I could not bear to hear you  
Screaming to be set free  
I would chain you up  
If I'd thought you'd swear  
The only one that mattered was me, me, me  
I would strap you up  
But don't worry baby  
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to  
  
It's too late to stop  
Won't the heavens save me?  
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide you baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
When the passion dies -  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day  
I'm like a doggie barking at your door  
So come take me back to the place you stay  
And maybe we can do it once more  
  
You say I'm dangerous  
But don't worry baby  
I get excited at the things that you do  
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie  
Cause no-one does it better than me and you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Please don't tell me lies  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I'm gonna spend some times with you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
You tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby  
One day you'll wake up on your own.  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
Everyone's got their eyes on you  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it
