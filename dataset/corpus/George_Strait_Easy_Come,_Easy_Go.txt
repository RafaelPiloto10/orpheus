Says she's had enough of me, I've had enough of her too.  
I might as well go on and set her free, she's already turned me loose.  
No fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong-  
That's just the way it sometimes goes.  
Sometimes two people just don't get along, it's time to hit the road.  
  
[Chorus]  
Goodbye, farewell, so long, vaya con dios.  
Good luck, wish you well, take it slow.  
Easy come girl, easy go.  
  
We tried to work it out a hundred times, ninety- nine it didn't work.  
I think it's best we put it all behind before we wind up getting hurt.  
No hard feelings darling, no regrets,  
No tears and no broken hearts.  
Call it quits, calling off all bets, it just wasn't in the cards.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easy come girl, easy go.  
Vaya con dios, good luck,  
Easy come, easy go.
