We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
Oh, and you've only just gone  
  
Oh, well, you punched and fell  
Then you felt embarrassed  
My heart goes out to you  
So I offered love  
And it was not required  
Oh, what else can I do?  
What else can I do?  
  
We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
And you've only just gone  
  
So, Sunny, send at least one thoughtful letter  
My heart goes out to you  
Tell us all how things are so much better  
My heart, it left with you  
What else can I do?  
  
Oh, they're not forgiving you  
And you're not even wrong  
  
Oh, with your jean belt wrapped around your arm  
Oh, Sunny, my heart goes out to you  
And with a needle pressed onto tight skin  
Sunny, I cry when I see where it's taken you  
  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I will not move  
Aah...
