If i didn't love you  
I'd be safe from harm.  
I would never find myself  
Lost inside your arms.  
If i didn't love you  
I'd never feel the pain  
Of sunny days without you  
Drowning in the rain.  
If i didn't love you  
  
If i didn't love you  
Peace would rule the day  
All the dark and out would surely go away.  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't pay the cost  
Of living every endless day  
If our love is lost.  
If i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
  
And yet you make me breathless  
At the way you move  
I never knew that i  
Could ever love the way we do.  
I don't know how you reach me  
In that place in my heart  
Belonging to only you.  
  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't lose control  
The danger loving brings a word  
Never touch my soul.  
If i didn't love you  
Perhaps i wouldn't die.  
If you should ever say to me  
"i'm sorry, goodbye."  
If i didn't love you  
How can there be music  
In the way you touch?  
I can't believe that somehow  
I believe in you so much.  
Now you've come and taught me  
How to give you my heart.  
And make me feel at last  
That the end will never start.  
You're the only reason  
I'm not afraid to fall.  
For if i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't love at all.
