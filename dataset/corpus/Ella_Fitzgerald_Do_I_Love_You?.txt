Do I love you do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I, if you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day, what would life be?  
  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you forever?  
Isn't heaven forevermore?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh my dear it's so easy to see  
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do  
Just as you love me.  
  
Will I leave you, never?

Oh my dear it's so easy to see  
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do
