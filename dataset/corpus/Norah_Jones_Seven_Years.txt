Spinning, laughing, dancing to  
Her favorite song  
A little girl with nothing wrong  
Is all alone  
  
Eyes wide open  
Always hoping for the sun  
And she'll sing her song to anyone  
That comes along  
  
Fragile as a leaf in autumn  
Just fallin' to the ground  
Without a sound  
  
Crooked little smile on her face  
Tells a tale of grace  
That's all her own  
  
Spinning, laughing, dancing to her  
Favorite song  
A little girl with nothing wrong  
And she's all alone
