Feelings you see  
Are so hard to believe  
All the chaos I have in my heart  
Devils I make and the love can relate  
All the solace inside tears me up  
  
Take me away.  
Set me on fire.  
There's no other way.  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
We've been deceived.  
Its so easy for me.  
Cause' the loathing I've had from the start.  
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes.  
As I'm down on my knees torn apart.  
  
Take me away.  
Set me on fire  
There's no other way  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
Where do I run?  
Where do I hide?  
Give me a reason to end my life  
  
Where do I run?  
Where do I hide?  
Give me a reason to get out alive  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what am I doing now? (what a am I doing now?)  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now
