I can't afford to breathe in this town  
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand  
Look back up to the cathode ray  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off  
  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
  
I want to breathe, I want to grow  
I'd say I want it but I don't know how  
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray  
  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off  
  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
Prove yourself  
  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off dead  
I'm better off  
  
Prove yourself
