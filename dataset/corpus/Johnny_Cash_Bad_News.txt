Ha ha ha come on bad news ha ha  
  
Well bad news travels like wildfire, good news travels slow  
They call me Ol' Wildfire, 'cuz everybody knows  
That I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go  
  
From north to south, east to west the story is the same  
From one state to another, I have to change my name  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls that hate to see me go  
  
Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland and they did in Frisco  
But I wouldn't choke and I broke their rope and they had to let me go  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go  
  
I've picked peaches in Georgia, lumberjacked up in Maine  
I've been hired and fired and put in jail in every state you can name  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
