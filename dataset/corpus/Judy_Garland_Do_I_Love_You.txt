After that sweet Summer afternoon  
When for the first time I saw you appear,  
Dreaming of you I composed a tune,  
So will you listen to it, dear?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?
