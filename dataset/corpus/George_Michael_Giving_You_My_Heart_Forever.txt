Don't ask me how it could be  
Sometimes it's hard to believe  
That in my lifetime I could find that someone  
Who can make me complete  
You are the air that I breathe  
I'd surely die if you leave  
'cause I have never felt this way ' bout any girl like I feel for you  
So this is what I'm gonna do  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
I know we'll always be together forever  
You lovin' me - me lovin' you  
And I'm giving you my heart to you  
  
You are so special to me  
Your love is all that I need  
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life  
Loving you faithfully  
  
This love I feel is so strong  
With you my heart's found a home  
'cause no one in this world could ever love me so tenderly  
So you can best believe  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
My love for you won't fade no never  
You lovin' me - me lovin' you  
And I'm giving you my heart to you  
  
And when I'm holding you close to me  
I know all of my dreams have come true  
Wanna let you know how I feel  
Girl my love is for real  
And I just wanna give it to you  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
I know we'll always be together forever  
You lovin' me - me lovin' you  
And I'm giving you my heart to you to you
