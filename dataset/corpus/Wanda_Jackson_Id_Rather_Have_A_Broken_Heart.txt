I'd rather have a broken heart a two time love I want no part  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
Don't want to share that kind of love it ain't the kind I'm dreamin' of  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
I'm gonna kiss your love goodbye I'd rather be a bird that flies  
I'd rather search for better things than see a bird with broken wings  
The dreams I've dreamed I tear apart I'm gonna stop before I start  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
[ guitar - fiddle ]  
I'm gonna kiss your love goodbye...
