Baby please, don't turn your back on me  
Let's walk along these cobblestones  
To a simpler time  
And why can't we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
  
Baby please, why won't you talk to me?  
Seems the more I give the more you cry  
To please you  
And why can't we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
Come my way  
  
Sometimes I'm feeling all alone,  
Each place is just an empty space  
And no rhyme or reason I run this stupid human race  
So take all my money and just have yourself a time  
Hope your having a good time  
  
Baby please, don't be so sad today  
Just drive on up to Thacker mountain  
Up to Tennessee  
And why can't we just take a look around us?  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
And why can't we just take a look around us?  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
Come my way
