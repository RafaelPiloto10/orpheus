The wind is a warning  
These fields turn to to sand  
My family will not answer me now  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
Don't say where this ring came from  
From whose shaking hands  
don't say who lies bleeding for me  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
There's a hole in the ceiling  
There's no pleasure in my gain  
My heart is in prison  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man  
Damned damned damned I am  
Loving the highway man
