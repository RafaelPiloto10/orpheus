Another sleepless night,  
I sit alone and cry,  
Twilight time 'til dawn,  
Memories linger on,  
Since we said goodbye.  
  
Throughout that sleepless night,  
No matter what I do,  
You're always on my mind,  
And though you're gone I find,  
I'm still in love with you.  
  
Shadows fall, and I recall,  
The love that you once had for me.  
Miss you so, when lights are low,  
I think of things that use to be.  
  
You're always in my heart,  
Although you're out of sight,  
Lonely teardrops burn,  
As I toss and turn,  
Another sleepless night.  
  
Although you're out of sight,  
Lonely teardrops burn,  
As I toss and turn,  
Another sleepless night.
