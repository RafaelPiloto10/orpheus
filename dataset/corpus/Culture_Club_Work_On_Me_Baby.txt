I wanna tell you something girl  
  
God intended and you planned it  
It was meant to be  
Like a lover, or a brother  
I'll shield you from the enemy  
  
Don't say forever  
Don't say forever  
Hold me  
Let's stay together  
Let's say together  
Look in my eyes  
Can't you see what I need?  
  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
I do it better when I'm under pressure  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
Some boys are devils  
And some fools say  
Maybe we'll work it out  
  
I think we'll work it out  
  
God intended, he depended  
On our honesty  
Like a lover, like no other  
I'll shield you from the enemy  
  
You've been trying baby  
Just painting a picture for me  
Ain't no use crying darling  
When we love so easily  
  
Every day in every way we'll work
