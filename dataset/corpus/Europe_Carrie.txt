When lights go down, I see no reason  
For you to cry. We've been through this before  
In every time, in every season,  
God knows I've tried  
So please don't ask for more.  
  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
This might be our last goodbye  
  
Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend  
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again  
  
I read your mind, with no intentions  
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain  
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience  
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.
