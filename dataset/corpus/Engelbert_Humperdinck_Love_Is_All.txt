Yesterday, I knew the games to play  
I thought I knew the way life was meant to be  
But now there's you, my foolish games are through  
Now at last I have found just what makes  
This whole world turn around  
Love is all I have to give  
Love is all as long as I shall live  
So take it all and I'll always be there  
When you call my name  
I know, know that love is all  
Every night I longed to hold you tight  
Until the morning light shines in your eyes  
So love me now, we'll get along some how  
Won't you please take my hand?  
And together, forever we'll stay  
Love is all I have to give  
Love is all as long as I shall live  
So take it all and I'll always be there  
When you call my name  
I know, know that love is all
