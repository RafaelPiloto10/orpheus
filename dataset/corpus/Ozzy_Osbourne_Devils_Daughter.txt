Well I know where you live  
I know you live alone  
I'll pay a visit in your darkest hour  
I've got a treat in store  
Won't be the same no more  
And I will demonstrate my holy power  
  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war.  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war  
  
You know what I'm about  
I'll cast the demons out  
And I'll persist until the battle's won  
I'll feel your creeping flesh  
If you're to be possessed  
Then I will desecrate what you've become  
  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war  
Devil's daughter  
  
The time has come at last  
Your future days have past  
No use in fighting battles you can't win  
The final conflict's lost  
You can't afford the cost  
Don't try to expiate your father's sins  
  
Breakdown, breakdown  
Breakdown and cry  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter ha ha ha
