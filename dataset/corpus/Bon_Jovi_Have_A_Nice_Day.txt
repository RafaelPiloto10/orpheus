Why, you want to tell me how to live my life?  
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?  
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand.  
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man.  
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid.  
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away.  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
  
Take a look around you, look nothing's what it seems.  
We're living in a broken home of hopes and dreams,  
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand.  
Everybody, pray enough to take a stand,  
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street,  
Looking for forgiveness,  
What's left to believe?  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
  
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down,  
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground.  
Well I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day
