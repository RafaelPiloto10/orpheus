I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you  
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own  
Oh baby you know, all that love-making we did  
Boy it was so real I wanna feel that again  
Long lost friend from way back when Kennedy was president  
Tell me where the melody went  
And if you still care, say yeah yeah  
Sing it like they used to do  
This one's for me and you  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, make love that's how to do it  
Just like we did back then  
Well, this is dedicated to you  
  
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you  
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own  
Oh baby you know, that love-making we did  
Boy it was so real I wanna feel that again  
And all your friends from way back then  
Saying can you visualize 36 chambers high  
Feels like we're there, yeah, yeah  
We were so afraid to say  
I hear them saying back to me  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, make love that's how you do it  
Just like we did it back then  
Well, this is dedicated to you

We all wish today's game was old again  
We just wish it wasn't full of draconian, Babylonian, phony men  
F-O-H, my summation fascinates  
We have debates, who's the greatest living or passed away  
I ask mc, see what she has to say  
Eric B or Master P  
Some see it differently, '87 meant to me  
I try to describe it, you try to relive it  
I try to revive it, hoping that you get it  
Somethin bout ladidadida got inside our bodies  
Somethin bout my adidas coming out the speakers  
Used to do the wop or the Peewee Herman  
Rest in peace, Heavy D, Money Earnin' Mount Vernon, let's go  
  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you
