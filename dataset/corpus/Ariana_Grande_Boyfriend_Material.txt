Now I've been looking for someone  
Trying to find the right boy to wear on my arm  
I must admit it  
You simply fit it  
You were like a cut from the rest,  
That's why you're winning (hey)  
  
Boy, at night when I close my eyes, I can see you  
My perfect type  
I never really thought my dreams would come true,  
Until I laid eyes on you  
Can't you know you are  
  
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material  
That's what you're made of,  
It's written on your label  
Boyfriend material, m-m-material,  
Want everyone to know  
  
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material (boy)  
  
Boyfriend material, m-m-material,  
Want everyone to know  
  
That you and your perfect smile  
Are both timeless and never going out of style  
There's so many reasons you got it together  
I'm catching feelings,  
You make me look better (better)  
  
Boy, at night when I close my eyes, I can see you  
My perfect type  
I never really thought my dreams would come true,  
Until I laid eyes on you  
Can't you know you are  
  
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material  
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label  
Boyfriend material, m-m-material,  
Want everyone to know

Oh, there ain't any other  
It's all the little things that you do,  
Make me wanna sing  
There ain't any other  
The way you're talking to me,  
I can tell you've been listening  
To everything  
  
And maybe it's the butterflies I get every time I hear your ringtone
(ringtone)  
And maybe it's cause every single text, boy,  
I told myself you were the one  
  
Boyfriend material  
  
(You know you are) Boyfriend material,  
Boyfriend material  
That's what you're made of,  
It's written on your label  
Boyfriend material, m-m-material,  
Want everyone to know  
  
You're my boyfriend material,  
Boyfriend material
