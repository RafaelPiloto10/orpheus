At Saturday night I got married  
Me and my wife settled down  
But me and my wife have parted  
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown  
  
Irene goodnight (goodnight Irene)  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream  
  
Stop your ramblin'  
Stop your gamblin'  
Stop stayin' out late, late at night  
Go home to your wife and your family  
Sit down by your fireside so bright  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream  
  
I love Irene and got new I do  
Still the sea runs dry  
And if Irene ever turns her back on me  
I'm gonna take morphine and die  
  
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream  
  
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream  
  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream
