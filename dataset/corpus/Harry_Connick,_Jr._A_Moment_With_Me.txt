You choose drawn curtains instead of light  
Your airy demeanor becomes polite  
All the things you adore don't mean all that much anymore  
Well there's really no mystery  
You just need someone to listen  
So come and spend a moment with me  
  
It isn't so easy to walk alone  
Especially knowing you're on your own  
The secret you've kept so well is much better with someone to tell  
We can speak confidentially  
I'll tell you what you've been missing  
Come and spend a moment with me  
  
You feel your heartache as bad as it's been  
It's finally beaten you down  
You don't want to partake but you want to win  
And there's no other party in town  
  
It's much too early to say goodnight  
Just one more moment and you just might  
See that a moment with me is more than you thought it could be  
We don't have to make history  
We can start with some kisses  
Come and spend a moment with me
