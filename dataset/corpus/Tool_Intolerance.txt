I don't want to be hostile.  
I don't want to be dismal.  
But I don't want to rot in an apathetic existence either.  
See I want to believe you,  
And I want to trust  
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger.  
But you lie, cheat, and steal.  
And yet I tolerate you.  
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method  
While I smile and laugh and dance  
And sing your praise and glory.  
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma  
As I smile and laugh and dance  
And sing your glory  
While you lie, cheat, and steal.  
How can I tolerate you.  
Our guilt, our blame,  
I've been far too sympathetic.  
Our blood, our fault.  
I've been far too sympathetic.  
I am not innocent.  
You are not innocent.  
No one is innocent.  
I will no longer tolerate you  
Even if I must go down beside you.  
Because, no one is innocent.
