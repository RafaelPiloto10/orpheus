Never thought that it would be this way without you  
It's taking all I have just to live from day to day  
My heart aches for you I can't believe we're through,  
Oh baby, I miss you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm lost, I'm lost without you baby  
The days aren't the same the nights are cold and gray  
I need you in my life  
If not now then someday  
  
As I think about the time we've shared together  
The way I feel for you I know I'll never feel again  
Memories of loving you still linger in my head  
Oh baby, I miss you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a feeling deep inside of me  
That just won't let you go  
And the more I try to fight it  
The more it seems to show...can't let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lost without you baby  
The days aren't the same the nights are cold and gray  
I need you right now  
Uh, If not now, maybe someday
