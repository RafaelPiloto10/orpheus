You've been right and I've been wrong,  
I've been weak and you've been strong.  
You've been good and I've been bad,  
Think I've had enough of that.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause all I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might.  
All I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might.  
  
I loved the days, you loved the night,  
I loved to love, you loved to fight.  
I drive to you, you're far away,  
It gets harder every day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wish you could be a friend of mine,  
Wish you could learn to play with time.  
You say I dream my life away  
If I do, well that's OK.  
  
[Chorus: x3]
