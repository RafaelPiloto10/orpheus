A mass of hands press on the market window  
Ghosts of progress  
Dressed in slow death  
Feeding on hunger  
And glaring through the promise  
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle  
A mass of nameless at the oasis  
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill  
Are buried for drinking  
The rivers water while  
Shackled to the the line at the empty well  
  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over new ground  
  
Listen to the facist sing  
"Take hope here  
War is elsewhere  
You were chosen  
This is Gods land  
Soon we'll be free  
Of blot and mixture  
Seeds planted by our Forefathers hand"  
A mass of promises  
Begin to rupture  
Like the pockets Of the new world kings  
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia  
Like the priest that fucked you As he whispered holy things  
A mass of tears have transform the stones now  
Sharpened on suffering  
And woven into the slings  
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress  
Taking today what tomorrow never brings  
  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over new ground  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground  
Ain't the new sound, just like the old sound  
Look at the noose now, over the, over the, over the burning ground  
  
Ain't it funny how the factory doors close  
Round the time that the school doors close  
Round the time that the doors of the jail cells  
Open up to greet you like the reaper  
Ain't its funny how the factory doors close  
Round the time that the school doors close  
Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells  
Open up to greet you like the reaper  
  
Oh, oh  
Oasis  
This is no oasis  
  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground  
This is the new sound, just like the old sound  
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground  
  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)  
Like ashes in the fall (ho, ho)  
Like ashes in the fall (ha, ha)
