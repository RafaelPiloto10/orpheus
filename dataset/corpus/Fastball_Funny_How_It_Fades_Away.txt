Those days when our hearts were as big as the sun  
Turn around with a smile for everyone  
That feeling's a memory  
Funny how it fades away  
You won't see those pale grays returning to blues  
The colors will wash out as I shrink in my shoes  
And I won't always live and breathe  
Watch me as I fade away  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away  
  
Who on this planet would ever refuse  
The chance of a lifetime to love and lose  
When time is of no importance  
Have you seen it slip away?  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away
