Life is very short  
And there's no time  
For fussing and fighting  
So I'll ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Do I have to keep on talking  
Until I can't go on  
Boy you see it your way  
You run the risk of knowing  
That our love will soon be gone  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Hear what you're saying  
You can get it wrong  
And still you think that it's alright  
Hear what I'm saying  
We can work it out  
And when it's straight, we'll say good night  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short  
And there's no time  
For fussing and fighting  
I've have ways thought  
That it's a crime  
So I will ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Only time will tell if I am right  
Or if I am wrong  
Boy you see it your way  
There's a chance that we might fall apart  
Before too long  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short  
And there's no time, no time  
For fussing and fighting  
I've have ways thought  
That it's a crime (dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty)  
So I will ask you once again
