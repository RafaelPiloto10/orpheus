In the big city, where the lights are low  
Cold dirty ground, where the rivers don't flow  
Nothing's gonna change so throw it all away  
In the big city, where the kids will come cheap  
And monsters prowl and never sleep  
Don't cross the road if you haven't got the time of day  
Well, I lost my girl waitin' for the train from Ride  
I know she's out there somewhere  
Selling all we got but I don't mind  
In the big city, you can walk a thin line  
And your mother won't know that you do a bit of crime  
Your father's on the dole and he really hasn't got the time  
In the big city, where it's hard to see the sky  
Black earth trembles when the trains go by  
Bums on the corner tell you gently crawl up and die  
Well, I lost my girl and I missed my train to Ride  
And I'm stuck here sellin' papers  
And spittin' on the ground when you walk by  
Break  
In the big city, you can dance all night  
Only if you're clean and the lads are not uptight  
Or you may as well forget it until the broad daylight  
In the big city, where the suits don't look you in the eye  
Learn how to laugh, you'll be plannin' when to die  
Don't expect favours when the cars go passing by  
I lost my girl waitin' for the train from Ride  
Well, I don't mind matching colours or parkin' people's cars  
And telling little lies if that's alright  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city
