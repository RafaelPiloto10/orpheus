Any way you can feel it  
You shouldn't try to conceal it baby  
You got to make up your mind  
Any way I can steal it  
Any way you can deal it to me  
You know the pleasure's all mine  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...  
That's right!  
I wanna say you're a firecracker  
I wanna say you're a switchblade knife  
You make your sex a career  
Comin' down from an all night tripper  
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper  
'Cause you can't get it from here  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...  
Goin' round n' round n' round n' round....  
I got this feeling deep inside my love  
Overwhelming feeling but I know not what  
One thing's for sure I ain't got time for those  
Who can't relate  
You gotta learn to love the midnight madness  
You gotta revel in the good and badness  
If yin n' yang is your thing  
What I gotta do to try and reach ya  
Is it for real or just a double feature  
So let's go throw the I ching  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...
