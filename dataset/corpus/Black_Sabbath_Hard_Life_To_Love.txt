Livin' in the fast lane is easy  
Till you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When you're out of control  
A slip of the tongue when  
It's done, is often hard to  
See it through  
So never let your words be lies  
Or they'll come looking for you  
  
It's a hard life to love  
  
For the price of glory you left  
And threw your fortunes away  
Never really cared too much for  
The job or the pay  
  
You're standing in the rain with  
No cover but you never complain  
You're an angry young man face to  
Face but your mirrors insane  
It's a hard life to love  
  
I'm simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And you're simply denying the fact  
That you're blind and I see no more  
I see red - I only see red  
  
Think of all the times I was  
Hurting but you felt no pain  
Think of all the lies you told me  
Again and again  
And still you see the truth  
From those who continue to lie  
And now you're seeking life  
From those who are living to die  
It's a hard life to love  
  
I'm simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And you're simply denying the fact  
That you're blind and I see no more  
I see red - I only see red  
  
Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy  
When you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When you've nowhere to go  
Don't give a damn when you're lost  
Cause you'll die from it all  
Laws were made to be broken  
And you do it for the thrill of it all  
It's a hard life to love  
It's a hard life to love
