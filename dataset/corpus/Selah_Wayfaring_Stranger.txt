I am a poor wayfaring stranger  
While traveling through this world below  
There is no sickness, toil, no danger  
In that bright world to which I go  
  
I know dark clouds will gather over me  
I know my pathway is rough and steep  
But golden fields here lie out before me  
Where weary eyes no more shall weep  
  
I'm going there to see my Father  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
  
I'll soon be free from every trial  
And this form will rest beneath the sod  
I'll drop the cross of self-denial  
And enter in my home with God  
  
I'm going there to see my Savior  
Who shed for me His precious blood  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
  
I'm going there to see my Father  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
I am just going over home
