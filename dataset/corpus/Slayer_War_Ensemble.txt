Propaganda death ensemble  
Burial to be  
Corpses rotting through the night  
In blood laced misery  
Scorched earth the policy  
The reason for the singe  
The pendulum it shaves the blade  
The strafing air blood raid  
  
infiltration push reserves  
Encircle the front lines  
Supreme art of strategy  
Playing on the minds  
Bombard till submission  
Take all to their graves  
Indication of triumph  
The number that are dead  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Sport the war, war support  
The sport is war, total war  
When victory's a massacre  
The final swing is not a drill  
It's how many people I can kill  
  
Be dead friend from above  
When darkness falls  
Descend into my sights  
Your fallen walls  
Spearhead break through the lines  
Flanked all around  
Soldiers of attrition  
Forward their ground  
Regime prophetic age  
Old in its time  
Flowing veins run on through  
Deep in the Rhine  
Center of the web  
All battles scored  
What is our war crimes  
(Era forever more...war)  
  
Propaganda war ensemble  
Burial to be  
Bones shining in the night  
In blood laced misery  
Campaign of elimination  
Twisted psychology  
When victory is to survive  
And death is defeat  
  
Sport the war, war support  
The sport is total war  
When victory's a massacre  
When victory is survival  
When this end is a slaughter  
The final swing is not a drill  
It's how many people I can kill
