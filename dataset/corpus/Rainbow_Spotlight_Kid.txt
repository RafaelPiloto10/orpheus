You don't know what's happenin' you want to go home  
But there's nowhere to hide  
You walk out on stage, your first time alone  
The crowd's going wild  
  
And you feel so alive  
You could stand up and take this all night  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
You're the spotlight kid  
  
Jokers and women they hang 'round your door  
They're all part of the scene  
Just like a junkie you've got to have more  
It's a pleasure machine  
  
And you fly every night  
But the dressing room mirror don't lie  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
You're the spotlight kid  
  
Your audience died, faded away  
It's been so many years since that first matinee  
It seems like an age  
Encore one more time  
  
For the ghosts of the part in your mind  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
  
You're the spotlight kid  
You're living in a dream  
You're the spotlight kid  
You're in love with the spotlight
