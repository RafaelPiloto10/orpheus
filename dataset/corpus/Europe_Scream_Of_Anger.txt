I won't live to see tomorrow  
There won't be another prayer  
None of them will ever sorrow  
Those who've sentenced me to death  
  
I've been waiting here for ages  
For the hangman to appear (the hangman to appear)  
Soon the priest will read some pages  
From the Bible for my fear  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
Oh no  
  
I feel like screaming out my anger  
There is so much left here to do  
When it happened I was younger  
And my destiny was you  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
  
And what can I do about leaving you  
We were only halfway through  
And what can I say, there was no other way  
They wouldn't let me stay
