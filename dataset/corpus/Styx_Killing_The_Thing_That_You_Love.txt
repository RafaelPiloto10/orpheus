Brick by brick you built a mansion  
Piece by piece it seems  
You're tearing it down  
  
Once you walked so tall and handsome  
Now nobody even wants you around  
Now you're just some kind of  
Leftover clown  
Now you're like Quasi Modo crying  
  
As you look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
Reaching for Venus De Milo  
But she's never gonna hold you tight  
You plant plutonium silos  
Then you blister from the sun that's too bright  
Like a vampire stepping into the light  
Just a victim of your own greed as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the world that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
The genius of a generation  
Blown away just like a leaf on the wind  
And now you're looking for salvation  
But you can't forget the places you've been  
And you can't erase a lifetime of sin  
And you can't escape the answers as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Dredging the river for what you have done  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin
