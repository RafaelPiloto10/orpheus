Cascading down  
There's a sound vaporising into vision  
It's a sound in my head  
That I feel and it shuts me in a prison  
  
Say it won't last  
Say it will pass  
Always the sound in my brain  
Can you hear it  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down  
  
Dancing away  
Like the lights on a moving coloured river  
Sounds in my head seem to run  
And again I feel a shiver  
  
Say it won't last  
Pray it will pass  
Always that sound in my brain  
Can you hear it (Can you hear it)  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down
