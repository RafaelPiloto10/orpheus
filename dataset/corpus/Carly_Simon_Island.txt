I'm an island  
Everyone can see that I'm an island  
I've got ocean just about everywhere that I can see  
And I'll be stranded unless you come to me  
And I'm lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
I would rather fall from grace completely  
Than let you change my mind  
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun  
  
Can't be too careful bout the friends you keep around you  
Some who never let you down  
Some who fail you every day  
And it's a blatant disrespect of privacy  
It amazes me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm an island  
Can't you understand me?  
I'm an island?  
And I'm finally by myself, the way I've got to be  
And that's exactly the thing that's been killing me  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
The rising...
