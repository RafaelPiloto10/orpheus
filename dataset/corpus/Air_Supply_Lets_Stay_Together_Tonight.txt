I feel your hand in mine, I touch your skin  
Your heart is calling out  
You want to let me in, to let me in  
  
Your lips are silent now, we're not alone  
I'd like to tell you how much  
I'd like to take you home  
So I can make love to you  
  
I believe in you so  
And there's only one moment to live  
When you're here next to me  
There's so much more I have to give  
  
CHORUS  
When the wind blows  
There's nothing else you can run to  
Let's stay together tonight  
I'm waiting for you  
All the words that I told you  
Will always be true  
Let's stay together tonight  
Whatever we do  
  
Why must I keep pretending  
I'm in control  
When I can feel your senses  
Burning through my soul  
Through my soul  
  
I believe in you so  
And there's only one moment to live  
When you're here next to me  
There's so much more I have to give  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Hold me close, don't let me go  
I just want you to say that, I need you  
I want you to know  
  
REPEAT CHORUS
