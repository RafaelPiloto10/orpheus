Just as I expected here you are back at my door  
Telling me the things you ain't gonna do no more  
And just as I expected you wanna love me again  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
I'm not the type of girl that's gonna let you down  
I'll point the right direction to get you out of town  
And if you need a guiding hand to find the road to sin  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
[ dobro ]  
Well if you think you'll get your kicks by hanging around  
Well honey here's a kick that I help you cover ground  
And what don't you just take yourself go back to where you've been  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
I'm not the type of girl...  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in
