Smile for me  
Let me know that I will always be  
The one and only one you'll always need  
Baby, smile for me  
Smile for me  
Chase away the cloud that constantly  
Is like a shadow hanging over me  
Baby, smile for me  
Smile your smile of total tenderness  
Smile the smile that takes away the rain  
Smile away my total emptiness  
For I never wanna have to cry again  
Smile for me  
And I'll become the girl you want to see  
No, there's nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
Smile your smile of total tenderness  
Oh smile your smile  
Smile the smile that takes away the rain  
Smile away my total emptiness  
No, I never, never wanna have to cry again  
Smile for me  
And I'll become the girl you want to see  
No, there's nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
No, there's nothing, nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
Smile for me
