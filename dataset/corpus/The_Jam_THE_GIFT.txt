Move - move - I've got the gift of life  
Can't you see it in the twinkle of my eye  
I can't stand up and I can't sit down  
I gotta keep movin' - I gotta keep movin'  
All the time that gets wasted hating  
Why don't you move together and make your heart feel better  
  
Groove - groove - to the beat of this drum  
Feel it in the wind and the warmth of the sun  
Don't sit down and don't stand up  
Keep on movin' - keep on movin'  
  
Think of the future and make it grow  
Why don't you move together an' make your heart feel better  
  
Take a pinch of white and pinch of black  
Mix it together and make a movin' flavour -  
  
Take a pinch of white and pinch of black  
Tell you move together an' make your heart feel better -  
  
Move - move - we got the gift of life  
Go and shout it from your roof mountain top  
Give it to me once and give it to me twice  
We gotta keep movin' - we gotta keep movin'!
