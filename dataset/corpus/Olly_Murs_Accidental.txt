I'm always at the place where your friends meet,  
It's the long way home but I walk your street  
And when I trip, and fall right at your feet.  
It's not accidental.  
  
I make it like luck is in the air,  
Every time you turn, I'm standing there  
You look into the stars, our names are clear.  
It's not accidental.  
  
And when you get a wrong number,  
Don't hang up too soon and wonder.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
I know you like the kind of clothes I wear  
Think I threw them on without a care  
The style's from a book  
You read a magazine you left.  
It's not coincidental.  
  
And even when you hear your favorite song  
You don't know, but I put it on  
You bought the record yesterday, so I knew what to play  
It's not coincidental.  
  
And when you get a wrong number,  
Don't hang up too soon and wonder.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
This all feels right time, right place whoa  
'Cause every time I see you face to face  
Our future calls.  
Not saying I bend the truth  
Just doing my best to get you, oh make you my destiny.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
It's not accidental  
Accidental.
