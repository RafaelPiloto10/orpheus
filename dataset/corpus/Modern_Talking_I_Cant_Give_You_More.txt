I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
I'll never find what I am searching for  
  
Oh, I know that I will die for you  
Can't you see my deep emotions?  
Tears may go, but, I'm lonely too  
My love is just like the ocean  
Oh, please come back to me  
Cause I won't die girl, for nothing  
Oh, your not blind to see  
Oh, I won't die girl, for nothing  
  
I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
I'll never find what I am searching for  
I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
There's no one else, this love you can't ignore
