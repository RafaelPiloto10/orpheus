The prodigal son, he'd been away awhile  
He was workin' his way back home now  
Over many a ragged mile  
When he finally crossed the river  
And his father saw him near  
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
People tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jesus, He did not doubt His gift  
Though He knew that He had not long to live  
He took care of the business  
Teaching us how to fly  
Then He bowed His head  
And laid down to die  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jerusalem, I see is standin' high  
But if you lose your salvation  
There'll be no tears left to cry  
Now some men worship a golden calf  
While others are bought and sold  
And if we live like that, brother, we pay the toll  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Still goin' down  
Still goin' down  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down
