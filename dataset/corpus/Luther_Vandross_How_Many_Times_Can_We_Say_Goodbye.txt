How many times can we say goodbye  
Steven Goldman  
(album: busy body - 1983)  
  
Duet with Dionne Warwick  
  
Here we are so close to the end now  
Still holding on we try and pretend now  
Clinging to love we both know is dying  
We've tried and tried to find us a way out  
But darling our dreams have now all been played out  
Still we go on hopelessly trying  
  
Chorus:  
But how many times can we say goodbye  
Hos many times can we see love die  
How many times can we give it one more try  
Before we really say goodbye  
  
We're so in love but wrong for each other  
Each hurt that heals brings on another  
Both of us used and both of us using  
Darling it's time that we stop pretending  
There's just no way to rewrite our ending  
We're caught in this game  
And we know we're both losing  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
How many times can we break up and make up  
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up  
Just can't go on and on living a lie  
Though I'll always love you  
  
Repeat Chorus and Fade
