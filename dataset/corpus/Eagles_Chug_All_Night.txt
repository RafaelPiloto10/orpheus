You scare me a bit,  
But that's all right  
You know when I want you  
Most every night  
  
And I've been meaning to tell  
You baby that it makes no sense  
Still I'm finally convinced  
Yeah yeah  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove  
Is right you're so much woman I  
  
Believe we could chug all night  
On the day that I die, well  
I just might scream  
If I'm alive in the morning  
  
I'll be alive in a dream  
You better listen to me baby  
Cause you know that I'm hung on you  
Till I'm blind and black and blue  
  
No one else will do  
I do believe we chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
  
You're so much woman I believe  
We could chug all night  
No woman ever do what you do  
High on a pleasure wheel  
  
No devil ever cast a voodoo  
So long and dark and real  
We're gonna do a little chugging  
We're gonna do a little hugging  
  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
I'm wired for sound  
Are you wired for light?  
And you're so much woman,  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I said a yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Woo! it's only midnight baby  
Come on and do it to me
