You might not wanna jog on this one  
You cannot wait for the summer  
You already hot, I'm already hot  
No sweat, no Under Armor  
Louboutin spice, all your good nights  
Holla back, if you need a sponsor  
Yeah I, ain't that Mr. Alright  
Come around, with a few more commas  
Come here girl, do what I gotta talk rose petals  
See me with lil' mama, kinda make you jealous  
Yeah be a honor, gotta say you special  
Beat it like a drummer girl, you better be careful  
Comprende, what's a bit late  
Like Fredrick I'll be jet lagged  
Calling on you this moment, this instant  
What I do is just basic instinct  
  
You see me all over her, you want me all over you (you, you, you, you)  
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do (do, do, do, do, do)  
  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna  
  
Head start, she got that shorty  
On your marks, til the shots get started  
Can you level on the rocks Bacardi  
Relay comes the after-party  
Pass the bottles, level up get naughty  
Full speed, hurry up put your body  
Trackmatic horse Ferrari  
Need a freak, of course I'm sorry  
You ain't get the memo, they made em get low  
See the finish the line, look a lot like limbo  
Yeah we going we in, no night like tempo  
There's another bad chick make light most simple  
Mr Brenda, no beginner, first place, tryna make you winner  
Yeah baby, my Brenda, I'll be waiting in the spot descender  
  
You see me all over her, you want me all over you (you, you, you, you)  
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do (do, do, do, do, do)  
  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna  
  
Yo, we in the spot, the club is hot  
And if you wanna party rock, say hell yeah (hell yeah!)  
Non stop, the bottles popped,  
And if you want another shot, say hell yeah (hell yeah!)  
Yo, I'm gonna run to you so you can have a little bit of fun with Foo  
I know what you wanna do, when I wiggle wiggle wiggle in my Underoos  
Got you wet, dripping like SoCo  
Never should've let you bounce on my pogo  
Now you wanna be my Yoko Ono  
So you roll stop acting like you don't know  
Fool, I'm running through these hoes like Drano  
But I keep it low pro, 'cause she's my main hoe  
I got your tickets, they're on Fandango  
Back room, no fro, I'll be eating a mango!  
  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna  
  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I  
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong  
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna
