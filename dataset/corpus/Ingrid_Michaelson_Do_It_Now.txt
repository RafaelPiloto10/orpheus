Sitting in the back of the bus  
Talking about nothing, oh we're talking about us  
Watching as the world goes hammering on  
Hammering on  
  
You say that you've got nothing left  
There's nothing left in you to find  
You're gonna ride it out gonna wait it out  
Living to die, you're living to die  
  
No one's gonna wait for you  
No one's gonna wait for you  
  
So do it now  
Do it right now  
Don't waste a minute on the darkness and the pity sitting in your mind and  
Do it right now  
Do it right now  
  
Everything will stop on a dime  
Everything will crash into itself in good time  
Do you want to beat your own heart beat your own heart  
Or leave it behind  
Leave it behind  
  
No one's gonna wait for you  
No one's gonna wait for you  
  
So do it now  
Do it right now  
Don't waste a minute on the darkness and the pity sitting in your mind and  
Do it right now  
Do it right now  
  
I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get right out of my bed, get out of my bed  
You're gonna stand up, you're gonna stand right up again stand right up again  
I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get out of my bed, get out of my head  
You're gonna stand up, you're gonna stand up  
You're gonna stand up  
You're gonna stand up  
  
So do it now  
Do it right now  
Don't waste a minute on the darkness and the pity sitting in your mind and  
Do it right now  
Do it right now
