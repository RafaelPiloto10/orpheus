It's never gonna be  
Normal, you and me  
What you're signing on for  
Is a storm at sea  
  
So if you think you're tough  
Give me all your love  
And I'll give you every little piece of me  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
We will never be a nuclear family  
But a rainbow will begin at our feet  
And if you take my hand  
Beware that this boat can  
Run aground making the ocean floor weep  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah  
Peace with me, yeah  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah
