I've seen those signs a million times  
The chill that clouds your eyes  
The light that shines black as a coal  
Deep down in the mind  
And I'm hungry, and I'm dying of thirst  
Just suffering from a lover's curse  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
I've walked the line, stood by your side,  
I've kept you company  
And all those times you felt like crying,  
I've held you close to me  
Now someone's put a spell on me,  
All my worst dreams are coming true  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me  
  
Around the tent, the storm was raging,  
The gypsy's eyes were wild and blazing  
Should have listened when she said  
You'd slip away from me  
  
The bottle's empty, I've drunk it dry,  
And still I feel the pain  
Well, all we had is lost now,  
Like teardrops in the rain  
The night is long, I'm tired and weary,  
But I don't know where this road will lead me,  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me
