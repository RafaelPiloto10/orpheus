When we took off, we almost had a critter of each kind  
We had a duckbill platypus and we had big ole lion  
We had a horse with two front teeth and a monkey on a chain  
Ridin' on Fox Hollow's Animal Train  
  
Well the skunk got off in Skenectady, we's glad to see him go  
The duck got off in Kentucky and the bear got off in Buffalo  
The horse got off in Austin, the mink got off in Maine  
Ridin' on Fox Hollow's Animal Train  
  
Well the cat jumped on the kangaroo and the elephant fell down  
The monkey blew the whistle every time we passed a town  
The lion fell asleep and left his tail out in the rain  
A-ridin' on Fox Hollow's Animal Train  
  
The beaver lost his toothbrush and the zebra lost his shirt  
The possum played the banjo and the pig played in the dirt  
We got off in Nashville just to play this little song  
Fox Hollow's Animal Train keeps movin' on  
  
And now the possum will play the banjo  
  
If you hear this train a-comin', you just listen for this sound  
That means that we're in town  
Get on board and we'll all laugh and play some silly games  
Ridin' on Fox Hollow's Animal Train
