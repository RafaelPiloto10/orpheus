(Hallo) Spaceboy, you're sleepy now [second time Hallo]  
Your silhouette is so stationary  
You're released but your custody calls  
And I want to be free  
  
Don't you want to be free  
Do you like girls or boys  
It's confusing these days  
But Moondust will cover you  
Cover you  
  
This chaos is killing me  
  
[Chorus]  
So bye bye love  
Yeah bye bye love  
Bye bye love  
Yeah bye bye love  
  
This chaos is killing me  
  
And the chaos is calling me  
  
Yeah bye bye love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This chaos is killing me  
This chaos is killing me  
  
Yeah bye bye love  
Bye bye love  
Good time love  
Be sweet sweet dove  
Bye bye spaceboy  
Bye bye love  
  
Moondust will cover you
