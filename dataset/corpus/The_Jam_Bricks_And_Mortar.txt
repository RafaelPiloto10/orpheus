Bricks and mortar reflecting social change  
Cracks in the pavement reveal cravings for success  
Why do we try to hide our past  
By pulling down houses and build car parks?  
Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass  
This is progress, nothing stands in its path  
  
Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets, and J.C.B.'s  
While hundreds are homeless, they're constructing a parking space  
  
Why do they have to knock them down  
And leave the site dormant for months on end?  
Who has the right to make that choice?  
A man whose home has cost forty grand  
  
Tell me!  
Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar  
Knock 'em down!
