Ohh, ah, yeah  
  
U work so hard, U really do  
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U  
Hot desert sun, U can feel the heat  
Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so U best believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)  
  
When U give 'em your all, and still it's only second best  
U can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest  
Every one of your worries, all your miseries (All your miseries)  
U can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea  
Cuz...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohh, ah, yeah  
  
I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses U when U come back home  
Come here!  
  
The world can be, well 2 put it frankly, such a bitch sometimes  
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is so damn hard 2 find  
Seems like all we ever find is another reason 2 cry  
As long as U got me I got your back and this is why  
  
U work so hard, U really do  
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U  
Better lock the door, U better unplug the phone  
Cuz I'm gonna give 1,000 reasons why we need 2 be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses, baby, when U get back home  
When U get back home  
Oh yeah  
  
I wanna hold U, wrap U up in lace  
And I wanna kiss U, kiss U all over your face  
I wanna love U all up and down  
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby)  
Give U love like U never had, all, ungagged and bound  
Ooh yeah (Ohh)  
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby)  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U, baby  
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby)  
I wanna, I wanna, yeah, I wanna hug U baby, kiss U  
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby)  
Yeah yeah, ooh
