I was up in the morning with the TV blarin'  
brush my teeth sittin' watchin' the news  
All the beaches were closed the ocean was a Red Sea  
but there was no one there to part it in two  
There was no fresh salad because there's hypos in the cabbage  
Staten Island disappeared at noon  
And they say the midwest is in great distress  
and NASA blew up the moon  
The ozone layer has no ozone anymore  
and you're gonna leave me for the guy next door  
I'm Sick of You  
They arrested the Mayor for an illegal favor  
sold the Empire State to Japan  
And Oliver North married William Secord  
and gave birth to a little Teheran  
And the Ayatollah bought a nuclear warhead  
if he dies he wants to go out in style  
And there's nothing to eat that don't carry the stink  
of some human waste dumped in the Nile  
Well one thing is certainly true  
no one here knows what to do  
I'm Sick of You  
The radio said there were 400 dead  
in some small town in Arkansas  
Some whacked out trucker  
drove into a nuclear reactor  
and killed everybody he saw  
Now he's on Morton Downey  
and he's glowing and shining  
doctors say this is a medical advance  
They say the bad makes the good  
and there's something to be learned  
in every human experience  
Well I know one thing that really is true  
This here's a zoo and the keeper ain't you  
And I'm sick of it, I'm Sick of You  
They ordained the Trumps  
and then he got the mumps  
and died being treated at Mt. Sinai  
And my best friend Bill  
died from a poison pill  
some wired doctor prescribed for stress  
My arms and legs are shrunk  
the food all has lumps  
They discovered some animal no one's ever seen  
It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire  
after running over Rudy Giuliani  
They say the President's dead  
but no one can find his head  
It's been missing now for weeks  
But no one noticed it  
he has seemed so fit  
and I'm Sick of it
