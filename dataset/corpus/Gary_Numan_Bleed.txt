Someone is talking  
But it's not conversation,  
Sounds more like a voice in my head.  
It says  
'I live in nightmares  
I'm the new god of panic  
And I'm waiting for you to come home to me.  
  
'So boy, welcome to sleep  
I'm gonna make you, make you, make you bleed.'  
  
I could be dreaming  
But then maybe that's fatal.  
There's nowhere to hide in your dreams.  
I'm so uneasy  
I'm shaking and nervous.  
I'm alone in my room and I'm scared of it.  
  
So, don't let me sleep  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.  
  
My mother told me  
'Don't believe in ghost stories.  
There's nothing to hurt you in here.'  
But she was wrong  
And now it's come back to haunt me.  
It says it won't leave me alive for long.  
  
I don't want to sleep.  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.
