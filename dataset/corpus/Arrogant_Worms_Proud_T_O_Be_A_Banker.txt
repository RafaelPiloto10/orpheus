I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money  
  
I'm having a lousy day  
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then  
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I don't really give a damn  
But I don't have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to talk to stimulating people  
  
I open up my mail  
Hoping that it's not a bill but it's from the bank  
Saying that I have only 20 hours to go  
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year  
So I run down to the bank but there's a 20-mile lineup  
And I'm yelling and I'm screaming  
And I'm not wearing any pants ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to screw with other people's lives  
  
I took out 40 bucks  
From the automatic teller. It told me  
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10  
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup  
And I'm talking to the teller  
She says "Wait I'll get your last month's statement"  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection  
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even  
Own a car  
  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money
