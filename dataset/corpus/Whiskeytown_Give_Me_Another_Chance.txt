You feel sad cause I got mad  
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
Things I said made things seem bad  
But don't worry  
Cause it's gonna be alright now  
Be okay  
You know I just don't think before I speak  
I've been looking for to find  
Something to believe in my mind  
And I thought it was you  
  
All this time since you've been mine  
I've been angry, so angry  
Made it known I could make it alone  
But I'm changing  
And I'm gonna be alright now  
Be okay  
You know I just woke up and I see the way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't give up on me so fast  
I see it's me that's wrong at last  
Give me another chance  
  
It's so hard just to stay alive each day  
I really can't go on this way, oh no  
Oh no  
  
Hey  
  
[Chorus]
