[Chorus: Sunny Valentine (Tash Mahogany)]  
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter
chick  
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit  
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...  
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)  
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...  
  
[Streetlife]  
You'se a starter, like Candice Parker  
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father  
Still the athlete, play of the week  
G.P.A. 4.0 and the game's complete  
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team  
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen  
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing  
Together we can capture the ring  
You the human highlight, body type, just right  
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night  
All-star shine so bright  
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights  
You're my number one draft pick, Madonna classic  
No look dunks to the basket  
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[GZA]  
Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke  
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips  
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep  
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets  
Whatever situation or the circumstances  
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances  
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead  
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride  
  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Inspectah Deck]  
Yeah, that's my down bitch  
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man  
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan  
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves  
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back  
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that  
Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene  
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens  
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen  
Playboy status, every man's lust  
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs  
  
[U-God]  
I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor  
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?  
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now  
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down  
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground  
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down  
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first  
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt  
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down  
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style  
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off  
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off  
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer  
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
You've learned how to kill  
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end  
Yet, we wish to preserve life  
The first thing to learn, is that difference  
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning
