I didn't really walk away I had something to explain  
Trying to reach you night and day when I did not know your name  
Shall we promise just to talk of it alone, all alone  
  
Why can't the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight  
Whisper the words I need to know speak to me that way tonight  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
  
How can I bring myself to sleep till I'm resting by your side  
Sharing the secrets hard to keep  
When you live them all through the night  
And then wake up with the words I'll always want you to say  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
  
A lonely man has come undone  
Is it wrong to think I understand when you are as close to me  
And not much further to go  
  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS
