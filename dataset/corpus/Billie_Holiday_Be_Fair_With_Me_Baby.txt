I'm helpless without you, baby  
I've almost lost my man  
Yes, helpless without you, baby  
I've almost lost my man  
I'm blue and confused  
Since you left me behind  
My friends all know it, baby  
The tears, I cannot hide  
My friends all know it, baby  
The tears, I cannot hide  
You've changed, you're dispositioned  
And throw my love aside  
Be fair with me, baby  
Our love can start anew  
Please be fair with me, baby  
Our love can start anew  
I'm blue and helpless, baby  
And I'm worried over you  
Yes, I'm worried  
I've got the helpless blue
