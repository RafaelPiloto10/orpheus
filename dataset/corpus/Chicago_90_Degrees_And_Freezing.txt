Here I am  
In this broken town  
Missing you  
Wishing you were still around  
  
Streets are full of people, happy  
Heading on their way  
Why am I the only one  
Who's COLD on such a pretty day?  
  
[Chorus]  
90 degrees and freezing  
I'm out here on my own  
I can't shake this feeling  
That I'm really all alone  
The Sun way up there shining  
But down here on the ground  
It's 90 degrees and freezing!  
  
Right or wrong  
This is how it is,  
The love that kept me warm  
Well, now it's his  
  
I remember how the heat in your eyes  
Helped me find my way  
How can I be left so cold inside  
On such a pretty day  
  
[Chorus: x2]
