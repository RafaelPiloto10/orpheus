All I need is a place to be  
And a way to feel  
A space to figure out where I belong  
A chance to know my thoughts  
And find a way to show  
What I feel...  
And if this is real...  
Yeah  
  
Don't wanna disappoint you  
Don't wanna let you down  
Cause that's the last thing I would do  
I'm asking for your patience  
I realize I could loose you  
But lately I've been so confused  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)  
Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me  
  
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong  
Or if it's just about me all along  
All I need is time to search within my soul  
So I can share a deeper part of me...  
Yeah  
  
Don't wanna disappoint you  
Don't wanna let you down  
Cause that's the last thing I would do

I've been thinkin' (thinking)

Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me  
  
Baby, what's meant to be (what was meant to be)  
Will surely be (will surely be baby)  
If you love me baby you would understand  
But I can't give you anything (can't give you anything)  
If I don't have myself to give (if I don't have myself to give)  
And it's killing me inside...  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)
