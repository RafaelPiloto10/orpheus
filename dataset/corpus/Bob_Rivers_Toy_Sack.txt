If you look up in the sky  
On the night before Christmas  
There's a big fat guy with a  
Toy sack  
Toy sack yeah yeah  
It's squeezing down through your fireplace  
Christmas Day  
A million Barbie dolls packed away  
Boxed up in a sack on a sleigh  
That jingle bell parka is as big as a whale  
They put everything into the toy sack  
They shove in a Chrysler  
And a tv from Sony  
So hurry up and pack that Shetland pony  
  
The toy sack is a magical place  
Where Santa puts the presents  
Toy sack Baby  
This sack's heavy  
Toy sack  
Break Santa's back  
Call a chiropractor  
Crack Santa's back  
  
Lugging and tuggin  
Huffin and puffin  
Reachin' in the bag  
There's an Easy-Bake Oven  
Now back up the chimney  
Yeah it's straining Santa's jimmies  
That sack's not skinny  
But every year he lugs it  
Around and around and around and around  
Reindeer are hoofin'  
There ain't no time for goofin baby  
Elves linin' up to pack toys for your town  
Bag is always movin  
Somethin's in there poopin' baby  
Puppies in the sack  
There's puppies in the sack  
  
The toy sack is a magical place  
Where Santa puts the presents  
Toy sack baby  
Toy sack baby  
Have a what  
Merry  
Christmas  
Toy Sack  
Santa's toy sack  
Toy Sack  
Santa's Toy Sack  
Baby

That's a lot of presents in the Toy Sack
