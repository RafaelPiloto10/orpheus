Daddy cool with a ninety dollar smile  
Took my money out of gratitude  
And he git right outa town - well  
  
I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down  
Gotta hit that latitude - babe  
  
[chorus repeat]  
  
Big bad leroy brown he got no common  
Sense - no, no  
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style  
Cant stand no more in this here jail  
I gotta rid myself of this sentence  
  
Gotta get out the heat, step into the shade  
Gotta get me there dead or alive - babe  
  
Wooh, wooh, big bad leroy, wooh, wooh,  
Wooh, wooh, big bad leroy - brown - well  
  
[chorus repeat]  
  
Big mama lulu belle she had a nervous breakdown  
(she had a nervous breakdown)  
Leroys taken her honey chile away  
But she met him down at the station  
Put a shot gun to his head  
And unless I be mistaken  
This is what she said  
big bad, big boy, big bad leroy brown  
Im gonna get that cutie pie  
  
[chorus repeat]
