Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,  
From glen to glen and down the mountains side.  
The summer's gone and all the leafs are falling,  
It's you, it's you, must go and I must cry.  
But come me back, when summer's in the meadows,  
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow.  
And I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow.  
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
And when you come and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead - as dead I well may be  
You'll come and find a place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me:  
And I shall hear though soft your tread above me.  
And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I shall live in peace, until you come to me.
