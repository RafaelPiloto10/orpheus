Every time I'm around you  
I'm caught by surprise  
A sense of electric anticipation  
Rolls into me when you smile.  
  
And I know that you're filled by emotion  
'Cause I see it in the tear  
That you hide  
Girl I don't want you to go  
'N I don't need you to know  
If forever is a part of your life  
  
[horus]  
All I ask of you  
Is hear your heart  
All I ask of you  
Is trust it babe  
  
They call love "illusion"  
They say "falling in love's a mistake"  
"It could be just about anybody"  
But I don't see it that way  
  
Hey I know what's in you  
Because I can feel it too.  
And I've never been more scared in my life  
  
'N I don't want you to go  
'N girl I don't need to know  
If forever's what I see in  
Your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as the night  
Knows the sun's comin' home  
Trust that our love  
Has a mind of its own
