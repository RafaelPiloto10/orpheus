Take a closer look inside yourself  
You may see the love I left behind  
Days were fast but full of life  
We laughed at everything  
  
Now you've gone time is standing still  
I don't do anything I'm so alone  
So lonely  
  
Still I can recall  
The happy times  
Laughing arm and arm  
So alive  
  
Was it years ago  
Or just a day  
When you turned to me  
Said goodbye  
  
Now you've gone away  
I don't know why  
Did you have to lie  
Walk away  
  
How can I go on  
In emptiness  
Feeling so alone  
Every day
