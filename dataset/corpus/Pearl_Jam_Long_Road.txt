And I wished for so long. Cannot stay.  
All the precious moments. Cannot stay.  
It's not like wings have fallen. Cannot stay.  
But still something's missing. I cannot say, yeah.  
Holding hands are daughters and sons.  
And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? (the long road) Cannot stay. (the long road)  
There's no need to say goodbye. (to say goodbye)  
All the friends and family.  
All the memories going round, round, round, round.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
And the wind keeps roaring. And the sky keeps turning grey.  
And the sun is set. The sun will rise another day.  
I...  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road. We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?
