We talk on the phone  
There it is it's only your mind  
But can it ?  
Don't you hurt  
It's all coming right here  
The sweet up and down  
Tickle in your throat  
Things you know quite well  
You're a joke  
I know what's gone wrong  
Needles in my legs keep me raw  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But think nothing about it  
When you're not around  
I believe in love  
Think it's just so fine  
Sweet up and down  
?  
Got two words to make up the wall  
God's the selling point  
And the great inventor of course of  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But believe that it's love  
That keeps beating me down  
I believe in love  
I think it's just fine  
The sweet up and down  
Leaves me  
I know my place  
I made my money selling  
God's the selling point  
And the great inventor of course of  
The sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
But think nothing about it  
When it's not around  
I believe in love  
I think it's just fine  
Oh the sweet up and down  
I believe in love  
And think nothing about it  
When you're not around  
I believe in love  
I think it's just fine  
Oh sweet up and down
