Everytime I look  
Into your lovely eyes  
I see a love that money  
Just can't buy  
  
One look from you  
I drift away  
I pray that you  
Are here to stay  
  
Chorus  
Anything you want  
You got it  
Anything you need  
You got it  
Anything at all  
You got it  
Baby  
  
Everytime I hold you  
I begin to understand  
Everything about you  
Tells me I'm your best friend  
I live my life  
To be with you  
No one can do  
The things you do  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm glad to give  
My love to you  
I know you feel  
The way I do
