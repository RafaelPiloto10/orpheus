She wants to know which way the wind blows  
And which way to go, I'm never gonna tell her  
And she wants to know why I'm been hiding myself out on the road alone  
Where no one knows my number  
She wants to know why I can't take it slow  
And why I can't settle down, but I'm never gonna burn out  
She wants to know why I've been lyin' to myself -- playing a loser's game  
Fightin' a losin' battle  
Far away, that's where I'll be  
Shine a light down hard on me  
[She wants to know which way the wind blows

[Far away, that's where I'll be  
Shine a light down hard on me  
Down hard on me  
Down hard on me]
