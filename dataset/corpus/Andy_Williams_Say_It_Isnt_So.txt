Say it isn't so  
Say it isn't so.  
Everyone is saying you don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say that you  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say passing by  
Say he's younger than I  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Tell me it's a lie.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.
