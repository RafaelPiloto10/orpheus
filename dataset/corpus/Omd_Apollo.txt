Let's move, let's shake  
Let's bleed, let's fake  
Let's go for broke  
Let's make mistakes  
Let's see, let's win  
Let's pray, let's cheat  
Let's have another dance  
Let's watch our feet  
  
Let's die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Let's sell our souls  
To the man above  
  
Let's move, let's go  
Let's hop, let's start  
Let's paint the town  
Let's break a few hearts  
We'll run, we'll shout  
We'll thrash, we'll cry  
But we'll never grow old  
And we'll never die  
  
Lying on a bed  
With apollo in my arms  
Doing everything we should  
And being killed by her charms  
  
I've got apollo in my heart  
She's tearing me apart  
She looks like an angel  
Held here in my arms  
Though I close my eyes  
And I turn away  
I'm not letting go  
No, not at this stage  
Because knowing is only half of it  
No matter what they say  
And seeing her is believing  
From miles and miles away  
She's closed her eyes  
And she's turned away  
She's letting go  
And I know she'll say  
  
Let's die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Let's sell our souls  
To the man above
