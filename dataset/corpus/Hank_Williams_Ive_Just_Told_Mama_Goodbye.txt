Each year on mother's day  
The rose I wore was red  
But today I'm saying my first prayer  
Mama's lying on her dying bed.  
  
I've just told mama good- bye  
Mother's day has turned to night  
Like the flowers in may, she withered away  
And my red rose is turning white.  
  
This is the dreaded hour  
We all must face someday  
Yet there's consolation in my heart  
She will bloom in the master's bouquet.  
  
Her time has come to go  
And there's nothing I can do  
Only hold her hand and say goodbye  
Mama's day with her children is through.  
  
I've just told mama goodbye  
And knelt beside her bed  
I heard her say, "I'll meet you someday,  
Where the white roses turn to red."
