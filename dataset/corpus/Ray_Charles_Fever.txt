Never knew how much I love you, never knew how much I care  
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night.  
  
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right  
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the the morning, oh fever all through the night.  
  
Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know  
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh  
Tell 'em about it  
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her, he said "Julie baby you're my flame"  
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair  
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said "Daddy,Daddy don't you dare"  
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight  
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.  
  
Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)  
Here's the point we have made (I'm listening)  
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn  
  
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.  
Aha, what a lovely way to burn.  
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn.  
All right now, what a lovely way to burn.  
I like that, what a lovely way to burn.
