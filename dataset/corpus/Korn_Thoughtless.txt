Going through the pages of my fantasies  
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  
I want to see you try to take a swing at me  
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny?  
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Come and fill the pages of my fantasies  
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown  
I want to kill and rape you the way you raped me  
And I'll pull the trigger  
And you're down, down, down  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny?  
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
All my friends are gone, they died (gonna take you down)  
They all screamed, and cried (gonna take you down)  
  
I got my monkey, got my monkey back against the wall  
Gonna take you down  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming
