And the cat and the fiddle  
And the cow jumped over the moon  
A little dog lied to see such a sport  
And the dish ran away with the spoon  
  
There was a little girl  
Who had a little curl  
Right in the middle of her forehead  
When she was good she was very very good  
But when she was bad she was horrid  
  
La lala lalala ...  
  
Humpty dumpty sat on the wall  
Humpty dumpty had a great fall  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put humpty together again  
  
Gerogi porgi pudding and pie  
Kissed the girls and made them cry  
When the boys came out to play  
Georgi porgi ran away  
  
La lala lalala ...  
  
Old king cole was a merry old soul  
And a merry old soul was he  
He called for his pipe  
And called for his bowl  
And called for his fiddlers three  
And every fiddler had a fiddle so fine  
And a very fine fiddle had he  
There's none so rare as can compare  
With old king cole and his fiddlers three  
  
La lala lalala ...
