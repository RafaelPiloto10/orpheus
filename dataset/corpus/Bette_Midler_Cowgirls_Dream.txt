I fell head over heels in Tucson,  
'Til the neon lights shined on his wedding band.  
And once a handsome Cherokee,  
He nearly swept me off my feet,  
And we danced the night away in old Cheyenne.  
  
Yeah, but something in my heart  
Says I'll know him in the dark  
When, at last, he comes along.  
  
Wee-ooo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
I see him ridin' through my dreams.  
Wee-whoo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
We're ridin' double as he sings.  
Wee-whoo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
It's a sagebrush moonlight scene.  
Wee-whoo, he's the answer to a cowgirl's dream.  
  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee-he-e-e-e  
  
Ah deedle lo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Ah deedle lo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee-he  
  
Wee-whoo wee-dle e-de-oh  
I see him ridin' through my dreams.  
Wee-whoo wee-dle e-de-oh  
We're ridin' double as he sings.  
Wee-ee-ee ooo-oo-oo wee-dle e-de-oh  
It's a sagebrush moonlight scene.  
Wee-ooo, he's the answer to a cowgirl's dreams.
