Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
I got a baby that's oh so pretty.  
I found her out here in this knock dead city.  
Somebody kissing my baby last night.  
My baby said " Junior that's all right".  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
  
Baby now baby understand.  
Jimmy looks good but he's a half a man.  
Roy looks cool but he's oh so cold.  
And then a big old junker gonna wreck your soul.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Two orphan babies were lying in the bed.  
The bigger one talked to Jimmy and said,  
"Love you Jimmy with all of my heart".  
Jimmy woke up and tore the place apart.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
  
Baby now baby hear my scene.  
I want to know if you do love me.  
I love you baby with all my heart.  
Oh please don't ever say we will part.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.  
Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy.
