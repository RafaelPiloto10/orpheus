Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel  
Grimy as an alley  
Loves me like no other lover  
Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little monster, baby, I adore you  
Man or woman living couldn't love me like you, baby  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising in the sky  
If I'm too rough, tell me  
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
  
Billion dollar baby  
I got you in the dime store  
No other little girl could ever hold you  
Any tighter, any tighter than me, bay  
Billion dollar baby  
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe  
Foaming like a dog that's been infected by the rabies  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising the sky  
If I'm too rough, tell me  
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
Million dollar baby  
Billion dollar bay  
Trillion dollar baby  
Zillion dollar baby
