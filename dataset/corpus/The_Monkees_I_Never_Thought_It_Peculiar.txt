I never thought it peculiar  
That you never gave me a smile.  
I wasn't socially suited  
To make it worth your while.  
  
Oh no and I never thought it peculiar  
That my heart always beat like a drum.  
Each time I would see you walk by me  
You were as pretty as they come.  
  
So I sent some flowers to your doorstep.  
And wrote on the card "I love you."  
I don't know why but I do know that I  
Had a feeling that you liked me too.  
  
So I never thought it peculiar  
When you stopped to ask me the time.  
And I don't think it's terribly peculiar  
That now, little girl, you are mine.
