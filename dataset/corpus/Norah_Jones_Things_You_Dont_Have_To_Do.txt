I walk down the diamond-studded concrete canyons  
Nobody looked me in the eye  
Tried to fly to the moon  
Only made it to the sky  
I was looking for an undying truth  
That had a single friend  
And I'm searching for a clear connection  
Without a digital send  
Ain't it just a little scary sometimes  
To find the lies that you know to be true  
I'll find you smiling about  
Things you don't have to do  
Things you don't have to do  
Bill, doesn't call me anymore  
I hear, he's found religion  
He's watchin' Benny Hinn  
With big blonde-haired apprentice beautician  
All the words and gesticulations that came before  
They don't seem to mean a thing  
You can feel fine to drop a dime  
If you're ever hanging by a string  
Ain't it just a little scary sometimes  
To find the lies that you know to be true  
Find you smiling about  
Things you don't have to do  
Things you don't have to do  
I hear voices cryin' out  
Echoes on the boulevard  
Contentious rambling incantations  
Of some senile bard  
There's too much goin' on around here  
To keep my head from spinning  
And this constant acceleration  
Blurs any ties to the beginning  
Ain't it just a little scary sometimes  
To find the lies that you know to be true  
I'll find you smiling about  
Things you don't have to do  
Things you don't have to do  
Things you don't have to do  
Things you don't have to do
