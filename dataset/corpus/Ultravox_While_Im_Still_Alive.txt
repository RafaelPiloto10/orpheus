Playing the game  
With the chips on my shoulder  
Checking in the mirror  
As my coffee cup gets colder  
  
Stagger and swagger  
Combing my hair  
If tomorrow's not there  
Then at least today's all mine  
  
[Chorus]  
While I'm still alive  
While I'm still alive  
While I'm still alive  
  
Strutting my stuff  
I'm blagging the damage  
From coupling with headlines  
I was suckled on salvage  
  
The fighting's exciting  
The age is dramatic  
I'm crackling with static  
Just jiving to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a stroll down the side roads, I know you want to  
A shock in the dark can be good for your heart, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Scuffling along  
On the crest of a wave  
Laughing and grafting  
Or jerking and working  
  
Striking a match  
Where life is a gas  
I need the flash  
To make it all worthwhile  
  
[Chorus]
