At First I was afriad I was petrified kept  
Think how I'm going to live without you by me side?  
But, then I spend so many nights just thinking how you  
Did me wrong but I grew strong and I learned how to get along  
And now you back from outer space  
Don't turn around,  
Cause your not welcome any more,  
Weren't you the one who tried  
To hurt me with goodbye  
You'd think I'd crumble youd think I'd lay down and die  
Now go now go, walk out the door  
Don't turn around now cause your not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  
You'd think i's crumble you'd think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no not I  
I will survive  
Oh as long as I know how to love i'll know i'll stay alive  
I 've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give I will survive  
I will survive hey hey hey
