Hold me my daddy,  
I never felt lower than dirt on the floor.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
I never felt like crying oceans before.  
  
If this means war, why are we in it?  
Might've fired off a couple of rounds, I didn't mean to begin it.  
If these are the bullets that every father and son must chew,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
Hold me my daddy,  
It hurts me to see grown men fighting this way.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
The young and the old dog aren't having their day.  
  
This civil war, why are we in it?  
There's nobody on this flat earth, would ever want to win it.  
If these are the hot coals that every father and son walks through,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
And if you agree we can make amends.  
All this squabbling I've hated.  
In another time and another place where our history bends,  
We could've been the best of friends and not merely related.  
  
Well these are the right words to say,  
They're difficult but still true,  
Well then hold me my daddy,  
I forgot to say I love you.  
  
(Hold him. Tight. Hold him like he was a baby.)
