Salesman, where you gonna go?  
To sell all your of your goods today  
Salesman, gonna walk along the street, see friends along the way  
Well salesman, with your wooden cart that you push along while you walk  
Hey, salesman, got a little dog whose tail wags when you talk  
You always wear a smile, even though you've gotta walk ten miles  
Short lifespan, good time salesman  
Yep, yep salesman got it on the street, whether it's hot or cold  
It's salesman, well, you work real hard,  
Until every part is sold  
Salesman as the years go by,  
People changing every day  
Hey, salesman 'till the end of time you'll be livin' in the same way  
You always wear a smile, you love 'em fast and you live wild  
Short life span, but ain't life grand?  
  
Copper kettles, different kinds of tin  
There goes salesman and he's sailing high again  
He's sailing so high, high, sailing so high  
  
Salesman where you gonna go to sell all of your goods today  
Yup, salesman, gonna walk along the street, see friends along the way  
Hey, salesman, with your wooden cart that you push along while you walk  
Hey, salesman with your secret goods that you push while you talk  
You always wear a smile,  
Even though you've gotta walk a hundred ten miles  
Short life span but the whole thing's grand  
Salesman  
  
Now, well, I tried the one that you put it in and you have to do it  
Manually. But I'd like the one that you just plug it in and it does it all  
By itself in a real long strand and you cut 'em up. It's easier to do it  
That way because, well, I put all the stuff in there and it keeps flippin'  
Out. And I can't get the thing to stick together anything. Coupled with  
The fact that I have to stick two of them together to even get on out of it  
And they always end up lookin' like Lucky Strikes.
