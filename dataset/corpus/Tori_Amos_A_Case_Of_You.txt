Just before our love got lost you said  
"I am as constant as the northern star"  
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness  
Where's that at  
If you want me I'll be in the bar"  
On the back of a cotton coaster  
In the blue T.V. screen light  
I drew a map of Canada  
Oh Canada  
With your face sketched on it twice  
  
In my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter and so sweet  
Well, I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
Oh I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I'm frightened by the devil  
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid  
I remember that time you told me  
"Love is touching souls"  
Surely you touched mine  
Cause part of you pours out of me  
In these lines from time to time  
  
My blood  
My holy wine  
Tastes so bitter and so sweet  
Well I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
I met a woman  
She had a mouth like yours  
She knew your devils and your deeds  
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him  
But be prepared to bleed"  
  
My blood  
My holy wine  
Tastes so bitter and so sweet  
Well I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet
