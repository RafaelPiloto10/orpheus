Are you ready  
Ready to cry  
Are you ready  
Ready to cry  
This is the saddest story we all know why  
So cry cry cry  
  
Are you ready  
Ready to leave  
This life we love  
You know what I mean  
No more whiskey  
No more cigarettes  
And your last breath just like a sunset  
You know I love your old bones  
I love your story but you're going home  
Are you ready  
  
Are you ready  
Ready to die  
Are you ready  
Ready to die  
Is there anything I can do  
Cause saying goodbye to you  
Will be the hardest thing I ever do  
Don't worry buddy we'll see this thing through  
I'll cry the river that carries you through  
Are you ready
