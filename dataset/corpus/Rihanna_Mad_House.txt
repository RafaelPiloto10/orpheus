Ladies and gentlemen  
To those among you  
Who are easily frightened  
We suggest you  
Turn away now  
To those of you  
Who think they can take it  
We say:  
Welcome to the mad house!  
  
Aaaaaah oooooh  
Aaaaaah oooooh  
Mad house  
  
Na na na na na  
Come on come on come on in  
Come on come on in  
Mad house  
  
Aaaaaah oooooh  
Aaaaaah oooooh  
Welcome to the mad house  
  
Na na na na na  
Come on come on come on in  
Come on come on in
