I wrote a letter but I threw it away  
I can't forget you, that's what I want to say  
Anytime or place, just to see your face  
Everytime I think of you  
You know it makes me sad  
That you feel this way 'cause I want you so bad  
And it don't seem right that you won't be here tonight  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waiting's so hard when you live without love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, everytime I think of you  
  
There's nothing left at all  
Only a photograph a-hanging on my wall  
It was my mistake, but it's my heart that aches  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waiting's so hard when you live without love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, everytime I...  
  
I wrote a letter, down to let you know  
That I still want you and I just can't let go  
And it still ain't right that you won't be here tonight  
Everytime I think of you  
  
Everytime I think of you I want to shout about it  
But waiting's so hard when you live without love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you  
Everytime I think of you
