Did you get all you want?  
Did you see the whole show?  
So where's all the fun  
That we used to know?  
As the memories fade  
Way out of view  
I'd love those old days  
To come back to you  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I'm not feeling so strong  
  
Did you say what you mean?  
Did you mean what you say?  
About this new scene  
Is it really that way?  
But the blindness goes on  
You say it's not so  
But what do you know?  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I'm not feeling so strong  
  
Ain't nothing new, it's just the same old thing  
You got me singing those old blues again  
  
Angry music, words of fire  
Painted faces filled with rage  
Even then they sound so tired  
I must be set in my old ways  
  
If this world is unimpressive  
It's been that way for quite awhile  
I don't need no heavy message  
Just turn me on and make me smile  
  
Yes I've been waiting such a long time  
Just for something to ring true  
Now I'd rather taste the old wine  
Than mess around with something new  
  
And the blindness goes on  
The blindness goes on  
  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out in the pouring rain  
With my back against the wall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out with nowhere to go  
And the shadows start to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out on this lonely road  
As the wind begins to howl  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone on this darkest night  
Feeling old and cold and grey  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me holding an empty heart  
As the curtain starts to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone in this crazy world  
When I'm old and cold and grey and time is gone.
