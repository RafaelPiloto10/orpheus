Everyone said that you'd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
You said on my lap that  
I wasn't the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you can't have ...  
You said on my lap that  
I wasn't the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
But who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
And nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you can't have ...  
Listen!  
Everyone said that you'd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl
