I'd like to close my eyes and go numb  
But there's a cold wind coming from  
The top of the highest high rise today  
  
It's not a breeze ?cause it blows hard  
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know  
Watch the warmth blow away  
  
Do you think I should adhere  
To that pressing new frontier  
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?  
  
Or should I hold my head up high  
And throw a wrench in spokes by  
Leaving the air behind me clear?  
  
Don't let the world bring you down  
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold  
  
Remember why you came and while you're alive  
Experience the warmth before you grow old
