Who's got the stuff that made the Wild West wild?  
Who pleases ev'ry woman, man and child?  
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?  
-Who?  
Colonel Buff'lo Bill  
  
Who's got the show that gets the most applause?  
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws  
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still  
-Who?  
Colonel Buff'lo Bill  
  
Did you ever see a cowboy rope a steer?  
-No, we haven't  
Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear?  
-No, we haven't  
Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear?  
-No, we haven't  
Did you ever see a hold up?  
-No, sir  
Then gather closer  
And let me give you some of the atmosphere  
  
The hour is midnight and all is still  
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill  
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail  
Never suspecting danger as they roll along  
The watchful driver is in his seat  
His trusty rifle lying at his feet  
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride  
Never suspecting there is something really wrong  
  
Suddenly there's a shout  
-What is it all about?  
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians  
-Indians!  
Indians  
-Indians!  
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians  
-Indians!  
  
Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force  
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?  
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill  
-Gen'ral Grant?  
No! Colonel Buff'lo Bill!  
  
-Certainly this is quite a thrill, better than all the vaudeville  
-Let us be on the go and see the show with Buff'lo Bill
