Well it's Friday night and I'm waiting  
On your call girl, like I do  
Am I wasting my time by this telephone line  
Waiting on your call to come through  
  
[Chorus]  
I should be already over you  
Tell me Mama, what can I do  
It's been a long hard road that you put me through  
Seven days over you  
Seven days, seven days over you  
Seven days over you  
  
Kick it  
  
I kick and fight for you baby  
But that's never enough for you  
You've been twisted and torn since the day you were born  
You make a game of breaking hearts in two  
  
Now I want to give up but I dig the rush too much  
I guess that's what love will do  
So drag your heart-stopping mind trip downtown, girl  
By Friday night I'll find someone new  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord knows what you put me through  
  
Already over you, tell me mama what can I do  
Already over you, tell me mama what can I do  
  
[Chorus]
