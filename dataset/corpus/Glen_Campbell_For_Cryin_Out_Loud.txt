There we were in this old mo-ovie  
We were watchin' actors play-ay charades  
We were playin' right along as best we could  
But I could see behind your sha-ade  
The plot was old and so fami-iliar  
People sluggin' it out for-or nickles and di-hi-hi-himes  
We had hear-eard the same old stor-or-ry  
So we made up our own li-ines  
Hey honey lets lose this crazy crowd  
There's really no safety in nu-umbers  
I love your so for cryin' out loud  
And I'm cryin' out loud  
I love you so, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh  
You look really like an a-angel  
When you said stop runnin', it slows you dow-own  
But you were makin' co-onversa-ation  
That was makin' my heart frow-own  
Hey honey, let's lose this crazy crowd  
There's really no safety in nu-umbers  
I love you so for cryin' out loud  
And I'm cryin' out loud  
I love you so, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh  
Honey, I'm a-cryin' out loud, I love you so  
Hear me cryin' out loud, I love you so-ho  
Ahhh-lahh-ahh-wahh-wahh
