Oh Yeah!  
You make me feel so pretty  
When I'm not feeling so cool today  
Yeah you pull me out  
When you know that I'm afraid  
Something about you  
It drys up every tear in my way  
And when I trip myself on the sidewalk  
You put my boots back on me babe  
Cause your my cowboy your my everything  
And you know how to get me  
Sometimes I'm feeling up sometimes I'm down  
You lift my feet up off the ground  
Sometimes I'm moving fast sometimes I'm slow  
You know where to make me go  
Sometimes I am the happy girl you love  
Sometimes I don't feel good enough  
Sometimes sometimes oh  
Your there when I need you  
Sometimes uh oh uh oh  
When I need you  
Sometimes uh oh uh oh  
  
I ask myself this question  
About you that I can not explain  
How you ride with me  
When you know that I'm to blame  
You've proved your love I  
Don't need to hear the words that you say  
But I know you say them anyway  
Just to keep me feeling safe  
As my worries become a yesterday  
Baby you get me  
Sometimes I'm feeling up sometimes I'm down  
You lift my feet up off the ground  
Sometimes I'm moving fast sometimes I'm slow  
You know where to make me go  
Sometimes I am the happy girl you love  
Sometimes I don't feel good enough  
Sometimes sometimes oh  
Your there when I need you  
Sometimes uh oh uh oh  
When I need you  
Sometimes uh oh uh oh  
And my worries become a yesterday  
Cause baby you know I'm...
