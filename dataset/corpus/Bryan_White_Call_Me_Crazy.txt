You told me all i would need was a little time  
But getting over you is still such an uphill climb  
I know i ought to be living in the present tense  
But the past i had with you was the last time  
My life made sense  
  
[Chorus:]  
Call me crazy-for hurting this way  
Call me crazy-go on and say  
It's a phase i'm going through  
Call me crazy-crazy over you  
  
I know you don't really mean to be so unkind  
But pardon me if i'm not in the right frame of mind  
To go on hearing how i should start all over again  
Face the future without you-  
I wouldn't know how to begin  
  
(repeat chorus)  
Bridge:  
You say I'm lost in a fantasy  
But what we had was real to me  
Call me crazy  
  
Go on and say  
It's a phase I'm going through  
Call me crazy-crazy over you  
Call me crazy
