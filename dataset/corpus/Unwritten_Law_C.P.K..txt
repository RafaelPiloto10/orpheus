I remember the way when we used to play  
All our troubles seemed so far away, yeah  
That was when I lived from day to day  
Do you remember the times  
When all on our minds  
Was having fun  
And catching a buzz  
That was life for you and for me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back  
Whoah oh oh I want it back, now  
I've got my life to live  
  
Looking back now at all of my friends  
And asking myself why these times had to end  
Well, I'm older now than I was then  
And it makes no sense to try and deny it  
There's no use to try and defy it  
That's the way life goes for you and for me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Hey  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back, now  
I've got my life to live  
Right now, right now, right now
