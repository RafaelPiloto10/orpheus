You ask me the time of day  
I tell you I don't know  
In darkness I'm light years away  
The voices come and go  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Burning bridges in the rain  
The crying embryo  
I seem so bliss-fully insane  
But still the pain won't go  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Sacred words the angles wait for me  
They'll set me free  
But I can't see the jokes on me  
  
Babies crying other peoples tears,  
And in thier eyes  
They have reflected wasted years  
  
You ask me who I really am  
I still say I don't know  
The doors have all been tightly slammed  
The poision seeds are sewn  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Dying angles falling from above  
I've had enough  
I can not laugh the jokes on me  
Shattered dreams you can not realize  
Won't sympathize  
It's in your eyes  
Why can't you see?  
Am I the liar?  
Tell me who's the liar
