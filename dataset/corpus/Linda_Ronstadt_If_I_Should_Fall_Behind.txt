Written by Bruce Springsteen  
(C) Bruce Springsteen  
We said we'd walk together baby come what may  
There come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as we're walking hands should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
We swore we'd travel darling side by side  
And we'd help each other stay in stride  
Each lover's steps fall so differently  
So I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Everyone dreams of love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
Let's make our steps clear that the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
And there 'neath the oak's bough soon we'll be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling I'll wait for you
