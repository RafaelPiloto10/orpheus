Hey God, why are you doing this to me?  
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  
Why am I seething with this animosity?  
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean.  
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.  
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.  
Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems?  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to.  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need you to hold on to.  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to.  
  
Don't take it.  
Don't take it.  
Don't take it.  
  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God  
  
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.  
I lost my ignorance, my security and pride.  
I'm all alone in this fucking world you must despise.  
Hey God, I believed your promises.Your promises were lies.  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
You made me throw it all away.  
My morals left to decay.  
How many you betray.  
You've taken everything.  
  
My head is filled with disease.  
My skin is begging you please.  
I'm on my hands and knees.  
I want so much to believe.  
  
Hey God  
Hey God  
Hey God
