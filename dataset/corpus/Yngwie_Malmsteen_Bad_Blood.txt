One word is spoken, and the silence breaks  
promises broken, as the heartache seeps in  
now I'm believing, all the things that i hear  
oh no more deceiving, cause i see you so clear  
wounds left to heal  
coldness I feel  
like ice through my veins  
bad blood-don't be bringing me down  
bad blood-can't put me in the ground  
bad blood-bitch you're not killing me  
bad blood-no other way it's gonna be  
your love is like prison, and i'm doing time  
waiting for freedom, while losing my mind  
too many reasons and to many lies  
now i'm through believin' you've opened my eyes  
bad blood-there's no one to blame  
bad blood-no more lying, no more pain  
bad blood-oh there's nothing left to say  
bad blood-it can't be no other way  
bad blood-don't be bringing me down  
bad blood-can't put me in the ground  
bad blood-oh there's nothing left to say  
bad, bad, bad blood.
