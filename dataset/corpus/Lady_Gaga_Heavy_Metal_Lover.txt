(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)  
  
I want your whiskey mouth  
All over my blond self  
Red wine, cheap perfume  
And a filthy pout  
  
Tonight bring all your friends  
Because a group does it better  
Love is down with a dance  
Let's have a full house of leather  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
Dirty pony, I  
Can't wait to hose you down  
You've got to earn your love  
Down in this part of town  
  
Dirty girls, in a patch  
Follow the Remington Rebels  
Let's raise hell in the streets  
Drink beer and get into trouble  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
I could be your girl  
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl  
But would you love me  
If I ruled the world, world, world  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
Women slap it, go fuck  
New York clappers, go drunk  
Black like vicars, go slow  
Move your pieces, you're junk  
  
Porsche and drivers, same Jane  
You're so hot, but not to taste  
Happy lovers on display  
Baby, we were born this way  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
I could be your girl  
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl  
But would you love me  
If I ruled the world, world, world  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover
