My superstars were laced up tight  
And all the sinners were gathered in white  
The pearly gates were opened up wide  
And the Lord must have seen me with his big red eyes  
So I stepped out to the clouds  
The Holy Father was getting down  
And as I ordered a round of drinks  
He said I got a little story tell me what you think  
Moses used to sniff the lines  
Noah used to rock the boat sometimes  
Mary used to get undone  
Jesus rode a Harley Davidson  
All the angels were gathered around  
Leather boots and lace night gowns  
And one started to kiss my feet  
She said the Lord got a red light on at every street  
My superstars were laced up tight  
And all the sinners were gathered in white  
The pearly gates were opened up wide  
And the Lord must have seen me with his big red eyes
