I'm layin' in the sunshine  
Just outside my door  
Dreamin' of the work I should do  
Just layin' on the floor  
Fences need repairing  
And money to be earned  
But I'd rather sit right here  
And think about the world  
  
So let me lie in the sun  
Let me dream all alone  
Let my worries fly away  
I am happy here so let me stay  
  
If you could only feel the same  
Your world would be a peaceful place  
  
So let us lie in the sun  
Let us dream all alone  
Let our worries fly away  
So happy here  
So let me stay  
  
If you could only feel the same  
Your world would be a peaceful place
