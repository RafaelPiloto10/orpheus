Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.  
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!  
To the rap mobile, let's go!  
  
Marshall! Marshall!  
  
Bitches and Gentleman!  
It's showtime!  
Hurry, hurry, step right up!  
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is  
  
Marshall!  
  
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now  
So without further ado, I bring to you  
  
Marshall!  
  
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless  
Most hardest, most honest, known artist  
Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden  
With his own private plane, his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)  
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes  
Yeah, here I come  
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Let's get down to business  
I don't got no time to play around what is this?  
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down  
On these clowns, can I get a witness?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best  
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it  
Flows too wet, nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
There's no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin' and you know what for  
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all  
To Marshall and Andre's carnival  
Come on! Now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo  
Two old friends, why panic?  
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect, the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat  
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy  
Jesus, how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me  
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V  
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy  
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me  
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains  
Nothin' but clowns down here  
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here  
Yo Dre!  
What up?  
Can I get a hell yeah?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So there you have it folks  
Marshall!  
Has come to save the day  
Back with his friend Andre  
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay  
Because  
Marshall!  
And Andre are here to stay and never go away  
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray  
Marshall!  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair, same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening  
Marshall!  
Oh! Ha!
