Desperately falling  
Feeling our love set us free  
We were better together  
Believed it was all meant to be  
Stay as one forever  
The band of gold would always prevail  
Happy in the moment  
Life betrays one, a fairytale  
Memories time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
Never saw it coming  
You left so suddenly  
What was here that scared you  
You want what I couldn't see  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
So far from each other  
So close to happiness  
I'll be there to remind you  
Love forgives but never forgets  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
  
How could I make you stay  
Where did I lose your love  
Still regret the night you walked away  
Oh, oh, yeah
