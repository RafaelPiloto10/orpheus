Mama told me, "Your lady's lookin' for another man"  
I never worry, there ain't a need for me to take no stand  
I got my reasons, the things I do are better left unsaid  
I'm into pleasin', I do my talkin' with my hands instead  
  
'Cause I can make some time  
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine  
You're starin' at the man, you want to land  
A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah  
  
I've been to Detroit, I've been to L.A. and I've seen St. Lou  
I've had some good times, but I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
  
'Cause I can make some time  
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine  
You're starin' at the man, you want to land  
A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah  
  
All American man
