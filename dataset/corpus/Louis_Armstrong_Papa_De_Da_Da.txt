Papa de da da  
He's a lady's man  
Papa de da da  
Sweetest in the land  
Papa de da da  
Watch him clap his hands  
He can play piano grand  
Papa de da da  
He's a lady's man  
Papa de da da  
Always plays the blues  
Neat and keen  
That's what I mean  
Got all the gals in New Orleans  
Papa de, da, da da da  
He's the hottest man in town  
He's nice and soft  
Never scoffs  
Red hot mamas  
He cools them off
