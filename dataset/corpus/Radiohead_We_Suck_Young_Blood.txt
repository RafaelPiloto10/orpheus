Are you hungry?  
Are you sick?  
Are you begging for a break?  
  
Are you sweet?  
Are you fresh?  
Are you strung up by the wrists?  
  
We want the young blood  
Are you fracturing?  
Are you torn at the seams?  
Would you do anything?  
Flea-bitten? Moth eaten?  
  
We suck young blood  
We suck young blood  
  
Won't let the creeping ivy  
Won't let the nervous bury me  
Our veins are thin  
Our rivers poisoned  
  
We want the sweet meats  
We want the young blood
