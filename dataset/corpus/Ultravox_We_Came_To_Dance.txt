We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away.  
We came to dance  
The piper calls out a different rhyme  
  
He cracks the whip and we step in time.  
Standing as the parade goes passing by  
I hear a voice around my cry.  
Like the sound of a distant drums  
Rejected and alone.  
  
A heart without a home  
Then someone said:  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance.  
Waiting as the panic grips my hand  
Hearing prose from high command  
  
Like a million times before  
No dignity or grace  
  
It's the price and not the race  
And someone said:  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance.  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away.  
  
Take what you can  
They said take it while you may.  
But keep in mind penalty fits the crime  
  
And it deals no softened blow.  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...
