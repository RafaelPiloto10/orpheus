I'm not going to lay around and whine and moan  
'Cause somebody done done me wrong  
Don't think for a minute  
That I'm gonna sit around and sing some old sad song  
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass  
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on some sunshine, to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
When I am gone put it in stone, he left nothing behind'  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
  
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do  
But I like to do just what I like  
I'll take the chance, dance the dance  
It might be wrong but then again it might be right  
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings  
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
  
When I'm gone put it in stone,  
"He left nothing behind"  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time
