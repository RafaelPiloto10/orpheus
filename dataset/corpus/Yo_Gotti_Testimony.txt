If I should die for our way  
I pray the streets my world to take  
Divide throughout the unfortunate  
Give my jewelery to the most respected  
My car to the one that's giving my guns to the gunners  
You know what I'm saying  
  
[Chorus]  
Cocaine thoughts, fish scale visions  
Pray the Lord forgive a nigga, streets is my religion  
Amen (amen), amen (amen)  
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen  
This my testimony, testimony  
My testimony, testimony  
This my testimony, testimony  
My testimony, testimony  
Amen (amen), amen (amen)  
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen  
  
See I'm a different type of nigga, I'm on that different shit  
Every day I wake up, I want a different bitch  
I don't want the whip plain, I want the kit on it  
Talking rims so big, they can feed on it  
I just bought a different watch, and another chain  
Fuck around and call my bitch another name  
Got confession to make, you hoes look the same  
And I'm so full of that liquor, it oughta be a shame  
Say the rap game changed, alot of niggas stressin'  
But between me and you, nigga that's a blessin'  
fake niggas come up, real niggas suffer  
Record labels fuckin' niggas, that's why I don't trust 'em  
This my testimony (my testimony), I made it true to see  
Hope the Lord forgive a nigga, streets is my religion  
Now I can get a amen, or can you bless a nigga with a thousand eight grams  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I'm in my hood, slangin' that white  
Shirt on right, no ? on sight  
Hundred I shoot, hundred I hit,  
Five hundred ? nigga this my life  
Yo Gotti don't shit round me but my money get high  
If it's crap in the room, and it ain't a real goon  
Then you know soon that it ain't my guy  
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen five  
Anything else, way too high  
Gucci, Louis that's all I buy  
way to high, need to come down  
Need a...  
Don't know me, don't know you  
...my hood, so don't come around.  
I'mma tell you like a nigger told me  
..might be OG  
That being said, that being told  
That's the first nigger in front of me,a whole key  
..put it in my hand, cause he know I wanna plan  
..he had to shoot me  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
  
Yeah, I hear... inside the kitchen saying  
..why took 'em bitches  
..full of money.. but I kept the chopper  
..cha cha cha ain't no stopping me!  
acting crazy, yes I am, nobody need to pray for me  
? I know they got a place for me  
You know how these game goes  
This ? and they don't need to take my crown
