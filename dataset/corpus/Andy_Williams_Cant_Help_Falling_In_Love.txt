Wise men say, only fools rush in,  
But I cant help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?  
If I cant help falling in love with you.  
  
Like a river flows, slowly to the sea,  
Darling so it goes,  
Some things are meant to be.  
  
Take my hand, take my whole life too.  
For I cant help falling in love with you.
