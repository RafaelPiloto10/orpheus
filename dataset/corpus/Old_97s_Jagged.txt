What remains of the day remains to be seen  
By the TV that we never turn on  
Each other's enough I never had it so rough  
Ever since I been gone  
White noise swells in my head  
Making me worry it's the summertime  
But it's the dead of the fall  
It's the dead of the night hell yes I mind  
I would give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I couldn't drink enough to make this make sense  
But I think I'm gonna give it a try  
There's no settling down  
There's only driving downstate so I drive  
I would give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged  
I'd give anything not to feel so jagged
