The story behind the painting  
I drew is already told  
No more tear stains on the pages of my diary  
Tired by unable to give up since I'm  
Responsible for the lives I saved  
  
The play is done  
The curtain's down  
  
All the tales are told  
All the orchids gone  
Lost in my own world  
Now I care for dead gardens  
  
My song is little worth anymore  
Time to lay this weary pen aside  
  
The play is done  
The curtain's down  
  
"Where are the wolves, the underwater moon  
The eleventh, the haven of youth  
Lagoons of the starlit sea  
Have I felt enough for one man's deed?  
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days  
And let the virgin conceive"  
  
All the tales
