I was born in southland twenty some odd years ago  
I ran away for the first time when I was four years old  
I'm a freeborn man my home is on my back  
I know every inch of highway every foot of backroad every mile of rairoad
track  
I got a gal Cincinnati I got a woman in San Antone  
I've always loved the girl next door but any place is home  
I'm a freeborn man...  
Got me a worn out guitar I carry in an old coal sack  
I've hocked it bout two hundred times but I always get it back  
I'm a freeborn man...  
[ guitar ]  
You may not like my appearance may not like my song  
May not like the way I talk but you'll like me when I'm gone  
I'm a freeborn man...  
I'm a freeborn man...
