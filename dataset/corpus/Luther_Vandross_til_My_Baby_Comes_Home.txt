There's a whole lot of girls  
messin' around  
trying to get me  
  
They do things cause they know  
my girl is away  
they try to upset me  
  
They cant believe I resist  
how can I hold out,  
where is that girl now  
but the truth really is  
I don't worry cause I love you baby so, That...  
  
No matter where my baby is  
she never leaves me without love  
She gives it up till I get enough  
then I'm alright  
'Til my baby comes home  
if she stays away for long  
she calls me on the phone  
I jump up when I hear her voice  
then I'm alright  
'Til my baby comes home  
  
I get weak in the knees  
my hands start to shakin'  
head gets to achin'  
is she thinkin' of me  
or feelin' the fire  
with some other guy, yeah  
I cant believe I can be  
worried about her  
I shouldn't doubt her  
cause our thing is for real  
and I don't worry  
cause I know, I know, I know...  
  
No matter where my baby is  
she never leaves me without love  
She gives it up till I get enough

I jump up when I hear her voice  
then I'm alright  
'Til my baby comes home  
  
Bring it on  
Home to me  
She makes everything alright, she's  
good to me  
She's the best part of my life  
cant you tell  
That I'm just like a new guy, I'm doing  
very well  
cause I know she's coming back tonight  
  
Every night when I sleep  
I dream of my baby  
she's such a lady  
then I wake up and see  
that she's laying by me  
right there beside me  
I cant explain how I fell  
I really love her, keep dreaming of her  
cause our love is for real  
and I don't worry  
cause I know, I know, I know  
  
No matter where my baby is
