I love the sun  
I love the sea  
I'd like to think that you  
Were here with me  
  
But people are seasons  
And seasons change  
I'd like to think that you  
Are still the same  
  
Sometimes you made me happy  
Sometimes you made me cry  
But the memory of a good friend  
Never dies  
  
Between the lines  
Of an aging face  
Something special that you can't replace  
  
But people are seasons  
And seasons change  
I'd like to think that you  
Are still the same  
  
Sometimes you made me happy  
Sometimes you made me cry  
But the memory of a good friend  
Never dies  
  
And I see you standing  
By the harbor wall  
And I see you waving  
From the aeroplane  
Two hearts together  
Laughing in the rain
