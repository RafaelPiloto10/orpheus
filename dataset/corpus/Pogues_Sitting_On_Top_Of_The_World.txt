Well it's been a long day but i don't like to moan  
It's the middle of summer and i'm chilled to the bone  
There's holes in my shoes where the rain comes in  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks  
I was talking to a stranger and he's on the rocks  
Down on the pavement living in a box  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no can't anybody see  
It's been a bad day and i want a little peace  
  
Oh no won't you please help me  
I want to lie down but there's no beds free  
  
Down on the corner there's starry eyed preachers  
Rattling cans and pimping jesus  
There's madmen on boxes makig speeches  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
You can't sit in the sunshine or go out after dark  
There's dogs on the loose acting like sharks  
There's psychos on the streets burning winos in the park  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i wish i was gone  
I want to get going before too long  
  
Oh no i want to leave town  
But i can't drive my car 'cause they put it in the pound  
  
The masters of industry are killing for oil  
There's poison in the air the water and the soil  
We're all turning mutant they're counting up their spoils  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
I turn on the tv and it makes me want to cry  
There's killing and there's torture there's destruction and there's lies  
And our leaders talk rubbish and more people die  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i can't take anymore  
I'm shaking all over and my nerves are all raw  
  
Oh no my head's a little sore  
I want to get out but i can't find the door
