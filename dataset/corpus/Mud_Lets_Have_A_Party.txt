Some people like to rock  
Some people like to roll  
But moving and a-grooving gonna satisfy my soul  
Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Send them to the store let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight.  
  
I've never kissed a bear  
I've never kissed a coon  
But I shake a chicken in the middle of the room  
Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Send them to the store let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight.  
  
Break  
  
Honky Tonky Joe  
Is knocking at the door  
Bring him and fill him up and send him on the floor.  
Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Send them to the store let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight.  
  
The meat is on the stove  
The bread is getting hot  
Everybody come and take a part of mamma's shot  
Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Sending him to the store let's have some more  
Let's have a party tonight.  
  
We're gonna have a party tonight.
