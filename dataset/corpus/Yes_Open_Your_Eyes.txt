You've got a great imagination  
  
You carry on in the same old way  
No lessons learned from yesterday  
  
Talk of changes lost in pages of paperwork  
  
I believe it...  
How can we refuse to see  
I've received it...  
What could be our final destiny  
I believe that...  
Still we go on from day to day  
Knowing what could be true  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
  
Open your eyes and discover  
You're not the only one  
In disguise  
Do you wonder  
When the change is gonna come?  
  
Open your eyes  
  
You've got a great imagination  
  
We cast the world, we set the stage  
For what could be the darkest age  
  
Short exchanges  
From perfect strangers  
We'll never know  
But wish we knew  
  
I believe it...  
It's time to face reality  
I've received it...  
Questioning the powers that be  
I believe it...  
Are we too confused to see?  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
  
Open your eyes and discover  
You're not the only one  
In disguise  
Do you wonder  
When the change is gonna come?  
  
Open your eyes  
You've got a great imagination  
Open your eyes  
Show it  
Show it  
  
Wish we knew  
  
I believe it...  
It's time to face reality  
I've received it...  
Things aren't what they used to be  
I believe it...  
What I see in you, you see in me  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew  
  
Open your eyes and discover  
You're not the only one  
In disguise  
Do you wonder  
When the change is gonna come?  
  
Change is gonna come  
Change is gonna come  
Change is gonna come  
You've got a great imagination  
  
Change is gonna come  
Change is gonna come  
Change is gonna come  
You've got a sweet imagination  
  
Change is gonna come  
Open your eyes  
Change is gonna come  
Open your eyes  
Change is gonna come  
You've got a deep imagination coming  
  
Show it  
Show it  
Show it  
  
Show it  
Show it  
Show it
