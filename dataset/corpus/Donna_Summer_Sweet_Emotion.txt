Seems every star is out tonight to light our love  
So round the moon so full and bright so high above  
But if you look real closely there's only me, there's only you  
And when you hold me closely, yeah  
  
And now the sky melts in the sea like they are one  
It's hard to tell where one first starts and where ends one  
That's the way our love is  
You part of me me part of you  
  
That's just what love is  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion, baby  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
  
You took me from the surface to a deeper deep  
Showing me that you  
And you are life for me  
Our love will last forever  
Me loving you, you loving me  
We'll always be together oh  
  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
  
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion  
Listen baby  
Listen to me  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
You got the sweet emotion, yeah  
Listen to me
