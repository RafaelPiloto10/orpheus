[Ice Cube]  
Yeah, yo, check it  
Turn me up a little bit, on the mic  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I flip shit for gang-bang niggas  
I talk shit for insane niggas  
I got a clip for you strange niggas  
(Click clack, get back, 'fore you niggas feel that)  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Understand, I come from South Central  
Motherfuckers don't know what I been through  
I keep my motherfuckin' heat in my igloo  
And it's lookin' for some meat it can get through  
Fuck with me, there will be agony  
In these streets, it will be a tragedy  
Can't you see, it ain't no fag in me  
If it was I would'a joined the Academy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
(Click clack, get back, 'fore you niggas feel that)  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Get back, y'all better get the fuck back  
I never take shit from rappers  
I turn them, motherfuckers into cadavers  
(Ka-plow!) I'm fuckin mo', niggas than Napster  
Cause you'se a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper  
I heard you lost on Fear Factor  
Cause you couldn't swallow deez nuts, big as a tractor  
You dumb bitch, think I'm an actor  
And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her  
Ice Cube, understand it's real  
I'm the nigga of steel, got you killin' at Will  
Got my nigga a deal, he tried to fuck me and steal  
I love the nigga but he now feelin the chill  
It's West coast (West coast) East coast (East coast)  
South side (South side) worldwide (worldwide)  
North side (North side) let's ride (let's ride)  
Let's do it till God and the devil collide, c'mon!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
(Click clack, get back, 'fore you niggas feel that)  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Y'all better get the fuck back  
  
[Chorus]
