Morning bell  
Morning bell  
(not another ???)  
Release me  
Release me  
You can keep the furniture  
Bump on the head  
Haul 'em down the chimney  
Release me  
Release me  
Please  
Release me  
Release me  
Where'd you park the car  
Where'd you park the car  
Clothes are all always on the furniture  
Now I might as well  
I might as well  
Sleezy jack  
The fire drill  
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round  
And round  
Cut the kids in half  
Cut the kids in half  
Cut the kids in half  
  
(murmuring)
