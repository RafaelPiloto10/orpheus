Smack dab in the middle of a situation overlooked by fools  
Tables turned, lessons learned, you get burned for playing by the rules  
Time is lost, that's the cost, oh brother, you get shit on the end  
Scrape for a dollar, you'll die smilin', learnin' the same lessons once again  
  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now  
(Right dude?  
That's right!)  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now  
(Isn't that right, dude?  
That's right, Gener, so right)  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now  
(Isn't that right, Gener? Tell me, tell me the truth  
You're right, tell me again)  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now (oh, check it out)  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, oh, take it  
  
Smack dab in the middle of a situation overlooked by fools  
Tables turned, lessons learned, you get burned for playing by the rules  
(You know that happens, Gener!  
And I know!)  
Time is lost, that's the cost, oh brother, you get shit on the end  
Scrape for a dollar, you'll die smilin', learnin' the same lessons once again  
  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now  
(Once again)  
The goin' gets tough from the getgo go man go  
Oh brother, not another motherfucker  
Gotta go now  
  
I think it's over now, Gener! (Gotta go now)  
Oh God!
