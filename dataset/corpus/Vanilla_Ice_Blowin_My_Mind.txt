Coolin' in the shade  
Sippin' on lemonade.  
I hear a knowck on the door who is it?  
Kim, comin' to pay me another visit.  
She tells me that I'm on her mind,  
And a player like me is very hard to find.  
I like the way she licks her lips starin' in my eyes,  
I must admit she's got some juicy thighs.  
I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit,  
That's why I got her in my mix.  
All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin',  
That's why I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Mind blowin', blowin' my mind  
  
Ten minutes past, I got my eyes on her ugh  
She's shaped like an hour glass.  
I like the red lipstick, she took a Popsicle out,  
And put it in her mouth quick.  
She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only  
A mac would like to hear.  
You see, I like a girl that really turns me on  
Twist with her walk, and sexy on the telephone.  
She tells me she dreams of me, she wants to be with me  
And not another memory,  
But for now we can hit the sheets baby,  
And keep it goin' now I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair,  
Now she's reaching for my underwear.  
I'm thinking I should make her wait  
For another day, oh I forget, sherri's on the way.  
Off came the top, she's looking in my eyes  
Here we go with the big surprise.  
I guess I can't resist it, hands all over my body  
As she puckered up and kissed.  
Uh, off came the pumps, I'm checkin' out the rump  
She's got a lotta junk in her trunk.  
And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin'  
Now I'm mind blowin'.
