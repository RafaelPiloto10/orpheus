When was I supposed to make my entrance  
How was I to know I had a chance  
Now here's a guy who really thought he had it all  
My heart was holding up the wall so I could dance  
  
The last of my romances has concluded  
Wars I've lost and loved have thus been fair  
The battle scars I've gained have all alluded  
To a decorated soldier of despair  
  
Baby I just had to see you  
Your face, your smile  
Baby I just had to see you  
Just for a while  
  
I ran from love to love and lied with laughter  
Not knowing that at some point I'd collide  
With someone who would be my ever after  
And happily would stay here by my side  
  
Baby I just had to see you  
Your face, your smile  
Baby I just had to see you  
Just for a while
