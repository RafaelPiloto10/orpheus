There is a voice in the silence  
A voice ever calling  
A voice like the song of a far distant sea  
A music the soul  
Of the wild breakers roaring  
If floats like a dream  
O'er the waters to me  
I hear it with tears  
And a heart wildly beating  
While far and alone  
In a strange land I roam  
And I weep as I list  
And my prayers give it greeting  
The voice of the green isle  
My country and my home  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh green isle of erin  
That waits for me yonder  
Though fate may decree  
T'is forever be part  
Still exiled and lonely  
Where ere I may wander  
The green isle of erin  
Remains in my heart  
  
There is nowhere a sea  
Like the blue rippling ocean  
That surges around  
And beside that dear strand  
There's nowhere a star  
That looks down in devotion  
So bright as are those  
That shine down on the land  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
With tears in my heart  
Tears beyond all controlling  
I wake and remember  
An exile am I  
And ipray as tho' between us  
The wide seas are roaring  
To come home to thee  
It is only to die  
  
Oh green isle of erin  
That waits for me yonder  
Though fate may decree  
T'is forever be part  
Still exiled and lonely  
Where ere I may wander  
The green isle of erin  
Remains in my heart
