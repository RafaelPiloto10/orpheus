She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.  
  
It came as no surprise to me  
That she'd leave me in misery.  
It seemed like only yesterday  
She made a vow that she'd never walk away.  
  
She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.  
  
And if it seemed a sin  
To love another man's woman, baby,  
I guess I'll keep on sinning  
Loving her, Lord, till my very last day.  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.
