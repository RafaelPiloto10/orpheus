S' wonderful! 'S marvelous!  
You should care for me!  
S' awful nice! 'S paradise!  
S' what I love to see!  
  
You've made my life so glamorous  
You can't blame me for feeling amorous.  
Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!  
That you should care for me!  
  
S' wonderful! S' marvelous!  
That you should care for me!  
S' awful nice! S' paradise!  
S' what I love to see!  
  
My dear, it's four-leaf clover time  
From now on my heart's working overtime.  
Oh! S' wonderful! 'S marvelous!  
That you should care for me!
