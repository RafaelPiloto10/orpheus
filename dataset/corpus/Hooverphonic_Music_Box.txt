Sin is so much more than poetry  
Better start to pray  
Crime is sensual  
Softly breathing down your neck  
Flooded chemistry  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one  
  
Poisoned arrow softly piercing my heart  
With poetry  
Watching the sunrise  
My eyes closing fast  
Swallowed by the sea  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one  
  
One music doll stops rotating, breaking  
Her song lingers on  
Translating  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one
