It's gonna take some time this time  
To get myself in shape.  
I really fell out of line this time,  
I really missed the gate.  
The birds on the telephone like, (next time)  
Are cryin' out to me, (next time)  
And I won't be so blind next time,  
And I'll find some harmony.  
  
But it's going to take some time this time,  
And I can't make demands.  
But, like the young trees in the winter time,  
I'll learn how to bend.  
After all the tears we've spent,  
How could we make amends?  
So, it's one more round for experience  
And I'm on the road again,  
And it's going to take some time this time!  
  
But it's going to take some time this time,  
No matter what I've planned.  
And, like the young trees in the winter time,  
I'll learn how to bend.  
After all the tears we've spent,  
How could we make amends?  
So, it's one more round for experience  
And I'm on the road again,  
And it's going to take some time this time!
