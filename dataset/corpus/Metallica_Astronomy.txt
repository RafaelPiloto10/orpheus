Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst  
Out at you from their hiding place  
Like acid and oil on a madman's face  
His reasons tend to fly away  
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah  
Like silver scrapes in May  
Now the sands become a crust  
And most of you have gone away (hm, yeah gone away)  
  
Come Susy dear, let's take a walk  
Just out there upon the beach  
I know you'll soon be married  
And you want to know where the winds come from  
Well it's never said at all  
On the map that Carrie reads  
Behind the clock back there you know  
At the four winds bar (hm, yeah)  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Four winds at the four winds bar  
Two doors locked and windows barred  
One door let to take you in  
The other one just mirrors it  
Hey, hey, yeah! hey, hey  
In hellish glare and inference  
The other one's a duplicate  
The queenly flux, eternal light  
Or the light that never warms  
Yes the light, that never, never warms  
Yes the light, that never, never warms  
Never warms, never warms  
  
The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst  
Out at you from their hiding place  
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear  
Would find themselves at the four winds bar  
It's the nexus of the crisis  
The origin of storms  
Just the place to hopelessly  
Encounter time and then came me  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Call me Desdenova, eternal light  
These gravely digs of mine  
Will surely prove a sight  
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent  
  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star  
  
Astronomy
