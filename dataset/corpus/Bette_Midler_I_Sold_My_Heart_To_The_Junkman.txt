All over town they're talking about me  
The whole world knows you're happy without me  
You've broken my heart, So what do I care?  
I'm thru with love, no more will I need it  
The word itself, I'll never repeat it  
A sign on my back I will wear, "This is my last love affair"  
  
I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted  
You brought it back to me all broken and busted  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again  
You took my heart because you thought you could use it  
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again  
Like a melodrama, in a simple manner  
Love played the leading part  
We had planned a happy ending  
But I'm left with a broken heart  
I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear  
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear  
I've sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again
