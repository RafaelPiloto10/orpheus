Four strings across the bridge,  
Ready to carry me over,  
Over the quavers, drunk in the bars,  
Out of the realm of the orchestra,  
Out of the realm of the orchestra.  
  
Filling me up with the shivers.  
Filling me up with the shivers and quivers.  
Filling me up with the shivers.  
  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!  
  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!  
  
Paganini up on the chimney,  
Lord of the dance,  
With Nero and old Nicky.  
Whack that devil  
Into my fiddlestick!  
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s,  
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s.  
  
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny.  
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-dee.  
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny.  
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!
