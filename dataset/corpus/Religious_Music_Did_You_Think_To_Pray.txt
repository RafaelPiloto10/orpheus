Ere you left your room this morning  
Did you think to pray  
In the name of Christ our Saviour  
Did you sue for loving favour  
As a shield today?  
  
Oh how praying rests the weary  
Prayer will change the night to day  
So when life seems dark and dreary  
Don't forget to pray.  
  
When you met with great temptation  
Did you think to pray  
By His dying love and merit  
Did you claim the Holy Spirit  
As your guide and stay?  
  
Oh how praying rests the weary  
Prayer will change the night to day  
So when life seems dark and dreary  
Don't forget to pray.  
  
When your heart was filled with anger  
Did you think to pray  
Did you plead for grace my brother  
That you might forgive another  
Who had crossed your way?  
  
Oh how praying rests the weary  
Prayer will change the night to day  
So when life seems dark and dreary  
Don't forget to pray...
