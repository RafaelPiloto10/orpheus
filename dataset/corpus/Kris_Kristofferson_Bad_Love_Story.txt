Once again you tried to show me  
What my eyes refused to see  
In the lines between the painful scene we're in  
With the silence falling coldly  
On a world of make-believe  
And the ending that I still don't understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a bad love story  
That I've had to learn by heart  
'Cause I've lived these lines so many times before  
And it's a shame the way the same old ending  
Still tears me apart  
Where the lady still don't love me anymore  
  
I can see the truth before me  
Like a mirror on the wall  
With a crack or two for every fool I've been  
And I see the lady waiting  
For her count-down curtain call  
And it's looking like the place that I came in  
  
[Chorus]
