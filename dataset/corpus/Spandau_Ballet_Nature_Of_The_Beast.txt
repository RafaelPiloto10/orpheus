It is the key to all the doors  
It is the crashing on the shores  
It lives in your steering wheel  
It hides in the wind and rain  
With voices as cold as steel  
It's calling your name  
It is the smile upon his face  
It is the winning of the race  
It lives in the red-alert  
It lives in the power game  
It's easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It is the glowing in his eyes  
It is the reason for his lies  
Oh, how many know you're there  
Oh, how many play your game  
He's always the man to dare  
You're always to blame  
It is the need to understand  
Oh, it is the trigger in his hand  
It lives in the uniform  
It grows from the need to gain  
With faces so old and torn  
It's calling your name  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It lives in the red-alert  
It lives in the power game  
It's easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)
