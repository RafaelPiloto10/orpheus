I would swim across oceans  
Just to talk with you  
I would climb a tall mountain  
Just to look at you  
I'd give my soul to the devil  
If you asked me to  
I would walk out of heaven  
Just to be with you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution  
  
I would be your disciple  
And I'd worship you  
Burn the prophets of reason  
Light the sky for you  
Kill the children of Eden  
If you want me to  
Close the dead eyes of God  
If they offended you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution
