I don't know nothing and I don't know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening, together we'll sing  
  
I've been walking for about a thousand years  
My feet are tired of crying all the painful tears  
And my sight is going blind, my soul is way down low  
And I haven't heard a thing, so that's all that I can know  
  
'Cause I don't know nothing and I don't know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening together we'll sing, we'll  
  
But I've been thinking and losing lots of sleep  
My life is getting longer, Winter snows come kind of deep  
But I keep my feet on strong, I'm moving right along  
But I haven't seen a thing so that's all that I can know  
  
'Cause I don't know nothing and y'all don't know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening, together we'll sing, we'll  
  
Well, I don't think that it's going that good today  
I can't take my eyes off of the rain and everybody's going insane  
And I don't think that it's going that good today  
I can't take my eyes off of the rain and everybody's running away  
I ran away to the top of the world today  
  
I've been drinking to drown away my fear  
The days are getting shorter, they're getting short  
But I still move along and I still don't sing my song  
But I haven't heard a thing so I play until I rhyme  
  
'Cause I don't know nothing, y'all don't know a thing  
But if we just keep on listening, together we'll sing, we'll  
  
Well, I don't think that it's going that good today  
I can't take my eyes off of the rain and everybody's going insane  
And I don't think that it's going that good today  
I can't take my eyes off of the rain and everybody's running away  
I ran away to the top of the world today  
  
Run away from, run away from, run away from you  
Run away from, run away from, run away from you  
Run away from, run away from, run away from you
