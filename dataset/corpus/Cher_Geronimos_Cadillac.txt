Put geronimo in jail down south  
Where he couldn't look  
A gift horse in the mouth  
Took old geronimo by storm  
Ripped off the feathers from his uniform  
Chorus:  
Oh boys, take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimo's cadillac  
Oh boys, take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimo's cadillac  
Sergeant, sergeant, oh don't you feel  
There's something wrong with your automobile  
Warden, warden, oh listen to me  
Be brave and set geronimo free  
Governor, governor, oh isn't it strange  
You never seen a car on the indian range  
(chorus)  
People, people, oh don't you know  
The indian's got no place to go  
Jesus told me, and I believe it's true  
The red man's in the sunset too  
Took our land, now they won't give it back  
They sent geronimo a cadillac  
(chorus)
