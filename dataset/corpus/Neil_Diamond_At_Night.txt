At night  
On some dark quiet street  
Baby, that's where we meet  
When day is through  
They say  
That our love isn't right  
So I wait for each night to be with you  
Till they realize  
Our love's not some passing phase  
We'll just meet at night and pray there  
For better days  
I wait for the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun,  
We'll meet at night  
I wait  
For the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun,  
We'll meet at night, at night...  
At night, come on, come on, now love
