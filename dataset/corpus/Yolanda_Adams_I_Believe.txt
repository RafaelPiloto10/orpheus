They said you wouldn't make is so far uh uh  
And ever since they said it, it's been hard  
But never mind the nights you had to cry  
'Cause you have never let it go inside  
You worked real hard  
And you know exactly what you want and need  
So believe and you can never give up  
You can reach your goals  
Just talk to your soul and say  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe I can (I can)  
I believe I will (I will)  
I believe I know my dreams are real (know my dreams are real)  
I believe I'll chant (Oh yea)  
I believe I'll dance  
I believe I'll grow real soon and (That's why)  
That is what I do believe  
  
Your goals are just a thing in your soul uh uh  
And you know that your moves will let them show  
You keep creating pictures in your mind  
So just believe they will come true in time  
It will be fine  
Leave all of your cares and stress behind  
Just let it go  
Let the music flow inside  
Forget all your pain  
And just start to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never mind what people say  
Hold your head high and turn away  
With all our hopes and dreams  
I will believe  
Even though it seems it's not for me  
I won't give up I'll keep it up  
Look into the sky  
I will achieve all my needs  
I will always believe  
  
[Repeat x2]  
I believe I can  
I believe I will (I can)  
I believe I know my dreams are real (I got strength)  
I believe I'll chant  
I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance)  
I believe I'll grow real soon and (watch me watch me watch me)  
That is what I do believe (I do believe in me)  
  
I believe I can  
I believe I will (oh yea)  
I believe I know my dreams are real  
I believe I'll chant  
I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance)  
I believe I'll grow real soon and  
That is what I do believe (I do believe! yayeeyay)
