Think of your fellowmen  
Lend them a helping hand  
(Put a little love in your heart)  
That's right now, baby  
  
You see it's getting late  
Oh please don't hesitate  
(Put a little love in your heart)  
  
And the world will be a better place  
And the world will be a better place  
For you and me  
You just wait and see  
  
Another day goes by  
Still the children cry  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
If you want the world to know  
We won't let hatred grow  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
And the world will be a better place  
And the world will be a better place  
For you and me  
You just wait and see  
  
Yeah yeah yeah...  
Put a little love...  
Put a little love...  
In your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
Take a good look around  
And if you're looking down  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
I hope when you decide  
Kindness will be your guide  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
And the world will be a better place  
And the world will be a better place  
For you and me  
You just wait and see  
  
Yeah yeah yeah...  
Put a little love  
Put a little love in your heart  
That's right now, baby  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
Love in your heart  
  
And the world will be a better place  
And the world will be a better place  
For you and me  
You just wait and see  
  
In your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
That's right now, baby  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love  
Help me out!
