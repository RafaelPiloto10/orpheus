Shoot, bang, no rhyme (should I know why)  
I'm in love with you  
Shoot back, just a fight (should I justify)  
Out of the blue  
  
I'm the Rubberbandman with the rubberman touch  
Out of the blue, love is such  
Rubberband man with the rubberband pack  
You're the one, you'll get me back on track  
  
Shoot, bang, no rhyme (should I know why)  
I'm in love with you  
Shoot back, just a fight (should I justify)  
Out of the blue  
  
Everybody told me what they shouldn't do  
I haven't got the problem  
Haven't got the clue  
I'm doing what I'm feeling and I'm doing fine  
The Rubberbandman, I don't mind  
  
Shoot, bang, no rhyme (should I know why)  
I'm in love with you  
Shoot back, just a fight (should I justify)  
Out of the blue  
  
I got the Rubberband dance  
It's chewin' the fat  
Cause I'm the Rubberbandman  
Out of the can  
Hoping when I see you I'm back on by  
The Rubberbandman doin' fine  
  
Shoot, bang, no rhyme (should I know why)  
I'm in love with you  
Shoot back, just a fight (should I justify)  
Out of the blue  
  
The filthy woman tells me what I shouldn't do  
I'm jumping in my can, out of the blue  
I haven't got the problem living in the can  
I'm doing alright, I'm the Rubberbandman
