Saved by your mercy  
Found in your grace  
Totally surrendered to your embrace  
And there's nothing more than you  
  
See your perfection  
I'm lost in your peace  
Your faithfulness sings over me  
And your love is the light of my soul  
  
And I lift my eyes to you  
Creator of the world  
  
And I stand in awe of you  
Of your glory  
And I live to worship you  
Son of god, king of heaven  
  
And the angels round your throne  
Cry out holy  
To the one who is to come  
Hear us sing hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
