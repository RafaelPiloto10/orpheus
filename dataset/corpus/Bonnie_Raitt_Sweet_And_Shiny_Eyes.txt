Your sweet and shiny eyes  
Are like the stars above Laredo  
Like meat and potatoes  
To me  
  
In my sweet dreams we are  
In a bar  
And it's my birthday  
Drinking salty marguaritas with Fernando  
  
  
Young and wild  
We drove 900 miles of Texas highway  
To the Mexican border  
As the day was comin' on  
  
We crossed the Rio Grande River  
And we swore we'd have things our way  
When we happened to walk in to Nuevo Leon  
  
  
Your sweet and shiny eyes  
Are like the stars above Laredo  
Like meat and potatoes  
To me  
  
In my sweet dreams we are  
In a bar  
And it's my birthday  
And we're having our picture taken  
With Fernando
