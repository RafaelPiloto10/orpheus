Time quickly passes by  
If only we could talk again  
Someday, I know I'll see you smiling  
When you're a free man again  
High on a mountain side  
We laughed and talked of things to come  
Someway, I know I'll see you shining  
When we're all free men again  
You left your country for peace of mind  
And something tells me you're doin' alright  
How are the children and Rosemarie?  
I long to see you and be in your company  
Someday, I hope I'll see you smiling  
When you're a free man again  
I often wonder, why  
Our world has gone so far astray?  
Someway, I know I'll see you shining  
When we're all free men again  
You gave love freely to those with tears  
Your eyes were sad then you saw the need  
You know that love lasts for eternity  
Let's be God's children and live in perfect peace  
Peace, perfect peace, perfect peace, peace  
Someway I know I'll see you shining  
When you're a free man  
When we're all free men again, yeah  
When you're a free man
