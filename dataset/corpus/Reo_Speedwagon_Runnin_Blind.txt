First you say one thing then you say another.  
I don't know the difference, were you lyin' to me baby?  
But it seems to me you got yourself in a bind.  
  
Always on the road playin' your guitar.  
Leaving me at home for cryin' out loud.  
Wish you could see babe that you're runnin' blind, yeah!  
  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
  
Well it's time for you to play all that you can say  
Is "Get out of my way. Don't be in the way"  
Always hear you screamin'  
I know you're just dreamin' of leavin' it all behind.  
  
Hands keep goin' up and down  
Eyes are turnin' around and around  
Your goin' crazy and nobody minds  
  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
  
Oooooo! You can't go on runnin' blind!  
  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'  
Change is comin' no more runnin'
