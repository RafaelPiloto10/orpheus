It don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
It don't mean a thing  
All you got to do is sing  
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
It makes no diff'rence  
If it's sweet or hot  
Just give that rhythm  
Ev'rything you got  
Oh, it don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
