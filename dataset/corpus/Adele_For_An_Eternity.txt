What does it to keep us together?  
We love so strong it's like dying  
Then we fight so hard we end up crying.  
Who are you that I can't let you go?  
  
Chorus-Why don't we let peace live between us and give ourselves a chance  
To  
Live in the largeness of love.  
  
You fill me with ecstasy until  
You leave me craving your will.  
When will you end this up and down  
I've had enough of looking for you upptown.  
  
Chorus  
  
I need you as a babe needs a mother's caress,  
Your heart to me is like an act of theft,  
Without your heart I am left bereft,  
Give me all you have now I need you boy.  
Chorus For all eternity you will be mine, I'll go to battle for what  
Belongs  
To me. What troubles have I caused you to deserve this. There is no one who  
  
Will love you like me. Chorus.
