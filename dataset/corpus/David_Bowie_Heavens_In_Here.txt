Baby, I dream between the blade and the tongue  
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb  
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall  
Skin on skin but there's heaven in  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
The first and the last are telling it all  
Telling you loud but selling it small  
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine  
Crucifix hangs and my heart's in my mouth but it's here  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
Heaven in one sigh, heaven in two eyes  
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs  
The rustle of your falling gown  
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls  
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here  
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall  
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
You'll dance to my tongue  
We'll dance on the sun  
We're the twilight and stars  
There's heaven in here
