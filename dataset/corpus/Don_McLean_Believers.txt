I got no money, got no job, I'm just another shufflin' slob.  
Well we've all been disappointed, we've had our dreams before.  
For with dreams you learn to take your turn  
In a world that don't believe in nothin' anymore.  
  
Some believe in Jesus. They don't act like they do.  
Some believe in Mohammed. I don't believe that's true.  
'Cause they do believe in money, and gold is what it's for.  
All the gold can't buy no peace of mind  
In a world that don't believe in nothin' anymore.  
  
She is a woman, with a baby child. A sacrificed human. Now she's runnin' wild.  
Well her dreams have all been shattered, her dignity defiled.  
She has lost her way but she must stay  
In a world that don't believe in nothin' anymore.  
  
Some believe in love. Where did it go?  
Some believe in children. Even they now know  
That we do believe in money, and gold is what it's for.  
All the gold can't buy no peace of mind  
In a world that don't believe in nothin' anymore.  
  
I believe in you, I believe in me and I don't care what the papers say.  
I believe in struggle, I believe in life, I believe that we will find a way.  
I believe in hope, I believe in dreams, I believe in luck, I believe in
schemes  
I believe in fate, I believe in time, I believe what I believe ain't worth a
dime.  
  
'Cause we do believe in money, and gold is what it's for.  
All the gold can't buy no peace of mind  
In a world that don't believe in nothin' anymore.  
  
I'll go on livin', I'll pay the cost. I'll keep on givin' to those who are
lost.  
'Cause the children will be coming and they'll soon know the score.  
They must understand I've played my hand  
In a world that don't believe
