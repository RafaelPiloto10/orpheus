Baby, I've never had a single thing in my life I could call my own.  
There you were, holding a love so true,  
Now I've got a home, now I've got a home.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby  
  
Baby, you really make me feel like a king, a king without a crown.  
But darlin', Promise me one little thing: That you won't let me down.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby  
  
Don't ever tell me lies baby,  
Don't take me for a ride baby,  
Just stay here by my side baby,  
We won't ever stop.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby
