If should stay  
I would only get in your way  
So I'll go  
But I know  
I'll think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
My darling, mmm  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all I'm taking with me  
So goodbye  
Please don't cry  
For we both know  
I'm not what you need  
An I will always love you  
I will always love you.  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you dreamed of  
And I wish you joy and happiness  
But above all this I wish you love.  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you
