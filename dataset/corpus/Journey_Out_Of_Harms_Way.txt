He grew up in some forgotten midwest town  
His mama raised him well  
Barely getting by, but he'd be okay  
As far as he could tell  
Oh, the plant in town closed ten years ago  
Now an empty ghost ship stands  
For the last nine months he's tried to find a job  
But there's nothing to be had  
  
So he signs up to fight for Uncle Sam  
It's the only choice he's got  
To fight a desert war with another land  
Only to find peace or not  
He's a moving target in a desperate place  
Every day is a twist of fate  
Oh, his family wonders if he'll make it home  
Knowing his faith's his saving grace  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Harms way  
  
Oh, they sent him home to his family  
Nursing wounds that no one sees  
Certain scents and smells trigger flashback spells  
That rewind the tragedy  
All these memories hold him prisoner  
Cause of the violence he regrets  
What was his ticket out is his nightmare now  
In a war he can't forget  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Harms way
