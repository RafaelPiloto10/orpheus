So I wandered like Jesus  
Like an alien cure  
Searching for my disciples  
Dispossessed and alone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your corruption.  
I took a virgin like Mary  
And said "I give you The One"  
I confessed to desire  
And watched the world come undone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your obsession.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To Heaven.  
Your Heaven.  
So I moved like a rumour  
Like a glorious lie  
And I walked into Heaven  
Into dead paradise.
