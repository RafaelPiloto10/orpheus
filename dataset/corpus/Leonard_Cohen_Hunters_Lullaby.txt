Your father's gone a-hunting  
He's lost in the forest so wild  
And he cannot take his wife with him  
He cannot take his child  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
Through the quicksand and the clay  
And a woman cannot follow him  
Although she knows the way  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
Through the silver and the glass  
Where only greed can enter  
But spirit, spirit cannot pass  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
For the beast he cannot bind  
And he leaves a baby sleeping  
And his blessings all behind  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
And he's lost his lucky charm  
And he's lost the guardian heart  
That keeps the hunter the harm  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
He asked me to say goodbye  
And he warned me not to stop him  
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try
