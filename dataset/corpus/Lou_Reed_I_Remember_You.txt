I remember you  
I remember me  
I remember  
I remember how things used to be  
I remember every word that you said  
I remember, how could I forget?  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
  
I remember you  
I remember your old address  
And I remember  
How could I forget?  
I remember thinking how my luck changed  
I remember being so amazed  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
  
I remember you  
I remember me  
I remember  
The way things used to be  
I remember how it was that we met  
I remember  
I will never forget  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)
