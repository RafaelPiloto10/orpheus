When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me  
"Son, we got a lot of land  
We got a lot of work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands"  
  
Well, I reached twenty-one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
I left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said, "Hold up the bank, boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands"  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling' my name  
He said he's teaching' me a lesson  
Now he's making' me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch, boy, fill it up  
I'm wanting you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands, get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey, David got to get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
You better remember what old Whispering Bill  
Told you in this song, get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
I got a little dirt on my hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands
