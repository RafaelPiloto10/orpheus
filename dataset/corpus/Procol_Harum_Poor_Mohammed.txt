Poor Mohammed at the peep show  
Kick the beggar down the stairs  
Can't keep guard, he's old and feeble  
Steal his books, burn his prayers  
  
Poor Mohammed at the keyhole  
Sit him by the kitchen door  
Slop his food all around the table  
Let him lick it off the floor  
  
Put Mohammed in the cellar  
Keep him there 'til half past ten  
Ties some bacon to his beard  
Let the rats out on him there
