Well, since my baby left me  
Well, I found a new place to dwell  
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street  
At Heartbreak Hotel  
Where I'll be--where I get so lonely, baby  
Well, I'm so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
Although it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken-hearted lovers  
To cry there in the gloom  
And be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby  
Well, they're so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die  
  
Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'  
And the desk clerk's dressed in black  
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street  
Well, they'll never, they'll never get back  
And they'll be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby  
Well, they're so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die  
  
Well now, if your baby leaves you  
And you have a sad tale to tell  
Just take a walk down Lonely Street  
To Heartbreak Hotel  
And you will be, you will be, you will be lonely, baby  
You'll be so lonely  
You'll be so lonely, you could die  
  
Well, though it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken-hearted lovers  
To cry there in the gloom  
And they'll be so, they'll be so lonely, baby  
They'll be so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die
