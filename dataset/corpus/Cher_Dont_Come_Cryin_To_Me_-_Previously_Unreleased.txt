Throw out our love like it was old news  
Be sure to wear your best pair of walking out shoes  
Go take the world into your hot hands  
You want the music baby, go have the dance  
  
Ooh, when you miss my love  
And you're thinking about  
How good it used to be  
Ooh, and when you long for my touch  
  
Baby, please don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So don't come crying, don't come crying to me  
Don't you come crying  
  
Walk out the door, go on and go free  
Step on my heart like it's the ground under your feet  
Find another lover if you want to  
You got to do whatever you got to do  
  
Ooh, but when the nights get cold  
And you're thinking about  
How hot we used to be  
Ooh, and when there's no one to hold  
  
Baby, please don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So don't come crying, don't come crying to me  
  
When you're loving  
And you tell you're [Incomprehensible] what you need  
Oh, don't you come crying, crying to me, no, no  
Don't come crying, don't you come crying  
  
Ooh, but when you miss my love  
When you're thinking about  
How good it used to be  
Ooh, and when you long for my touch  
  
Baby, please don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So don't come crying, don't come crying now  
  
Don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So, so don't come crying, baby, don't come crying now  
  
When you're lonely  
Can't get what you need  
Oh, don't you come crying to me  
Don't come crying  
Don't you come crying  
  
Don't come crying  
Don't you come crying  
Crying to me, no, no  
Don't come crying
