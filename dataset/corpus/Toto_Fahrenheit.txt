Feel the heat, in the street  
Find out what your people are sayin'  
  
Feel the heat, in the street  
Find out what the people are sayin'  
'Bout you! Yeh you  
  
Friends you keep, lie and cheat  
Makin' rules for games that they're playin'  
  
When you meet, on the street  
You find out all along they're playin'  
Me against you  
  
I don't care what they say about me  
I've heard that all before  
Just make this one exception  
Give me your affection  
Listen to your heart for what you need  
  
Feel the heat, in the street  
You're the one that keeps the boys dreamin'  
  
If you feel the need, come to me  
Or you may find what's on your mind  
May come true
