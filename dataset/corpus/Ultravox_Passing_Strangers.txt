We were so young, we were too vain.  
Dance in the dark, sing in the rain.  
Time on our hands, hope in our hearts.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon.  
  
We stood alone, silent and proud.  
Moments unknown, lost in a crowd.  
Running through memories like thieves in the night.  
Clutching emotions, holding too tight.  
Hold turns to dust, shattered by light.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.
