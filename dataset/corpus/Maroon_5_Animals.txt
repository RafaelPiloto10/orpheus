[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Verse 1]  
So what you trying to do to me,  
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies,  
But we get along when I'm inside you.  
You're like a drug that's killing me,  
I cut you out entirely,  
But I get so high when I'm inside you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free,  
You can find other fish in the sea,  
You can pretend it's meant to be,  
But you can't stay away from me.  
I can still hear you making that sound,  
Taking me down rolling on the ground,  
You can pretend that it was me, but no.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Verse 2]  
So if I run, it's not enough,  
You're still in my head, forever stuck,  
So you can do, what you wanna do.  
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up,  
But don't deny the animal  
That comes alive when I'm inside you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free,  
You can find other fish in the sea,  
You can pretend it's meant to be,  
But you can't stay away from me.  
I can still hear you making that sound,  
Taking me down rolling on the ground,  
You can pretend that it was me, but no.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Bridge]  
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
[Break]  
Yo, woahh, woahh...  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, mals.  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, mals.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Outro]  
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
