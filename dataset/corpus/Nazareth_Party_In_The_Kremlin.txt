Party in the Kremlin  
People seein' red  
Lenin got the elbow  
It's a different mob instead  
Party in the Kremlin  
It's the only place to be  
You better wear your Rolex  
Like a true new revolutionary  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
No more KGB  
So what is it they do now?  
Can anybody see?  
Party in the Kremlin  
It's the hottest spot in town  
Discos and casinos  
Never let you down  
  
Trippin' in Siberia  
Rock and roll hysteria  
Vladivostok to Moscow  
And all points in between  
It's a new place  
Got a new face  
And a brand new dream  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
Suits from Tokyo  
Guccis are a shinin'  
Smokin' Marlboro  
Party in the Kremlin  
Drivin' foreign cars  
You better find an angle  
If you want to play a part  
  
Dancing bears and presidents  
Acting under influence  
We got bank loans  
And cell phones  
And Levis to wear  
They got us linin' up  
For Mickey D's in Pushkin Square  
  
Vsea govorjat dal  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin
