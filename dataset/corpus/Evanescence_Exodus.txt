My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams  
Twenty bucks should get me through the week  
Never said a word of discontentment  
Thought it a thousand times but now I'm leaving home  
  
Here in my shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay where I don't belong  
  
Two months pass by and it's getting cold  
I know I'm not lost, I'm just alone  
But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now  
Waking up is knowing who you really are  
  
Here in my shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay where I don't belong  
  
In the shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay here  
  
Show me the shadow where true meaning lies  
So much more dismay in empty eyes
