Train entering the city - I lost myself and never came back  
Took a trip around the world and never came back  
Black silhouettes, crisscrossed tracks never came back  
  
Forever changed, forever changed  
  
You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold  
You might think I'm frivolous - depends on your point of view  
Society Andy who paints and records them - the high and the low  
I left my old life behind me and never went back  
Forever changed, forever changed  
  
Got to get to the city - get a job  
Got to get some work to see me through  
My old life's disappearing from view  
Hong Kong - and I was changed  
Burma and India - and I was changed  
Only art to see me through  
Only heart to see me through  
My old life disappearing from view  
Brigid and Pat - please see me through  
The whole thing quickly receding  
My life disappearing - disappearing from view  
Forever changed, forever changed  
I left my old life behind and was forever changed  
Forever changed
