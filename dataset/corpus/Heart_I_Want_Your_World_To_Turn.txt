Call it bad timing  
But I call it destiny  
It wouldn't have happened  
If it wasn't meant to be  
  
I felt your heart like a magnet  
Your eyes were touching me  
Touching me, touching me  
  
I want your world to turn  
Just for me  
I want your fire to burn just for me  
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea  
I want your world to turn just for me  
  
I won't share your love  
No, I want it all for my own  
When you are in her arms  
It really cuts me down to the bone  
  
I felt your heart like a magnet  
Your eyes were touching me  
Touching me, touching me  
  
I want your world to turn  
Just for me, yeah  
I want your fire to burn just for me  
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea  
I want your world to turn just for me
