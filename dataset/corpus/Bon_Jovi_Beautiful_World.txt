Every day it's the same when they say that it might be the end  
In the end when it ends then I'll listen to them  
You wake up, go to work, go to sleep, then you do it, you do it  
If you're lucky then you do it again  
  
Yeah we walk through a world that we don't understand  
When I look in your eyes I'm just happy I can  
Yeah we'll laugh and we'll cry and we'll lose and we'll win  
We'll get through it and to prove it, yeah we'll do it again  
There's glory in the saddest story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
  
It's a shame when they say that's it's been done and said  
they keep digging that grave,let them bury their heads  
there's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars  
there's another first kiss, in the back of some car  
Turn the page and write the story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.  
  
They're running numbers out of the Spanish coast  
Winery merry Mary says her rosary  
we get a ladder, cause there's a cat up in a tree  
Ah, the pretzel mans wearing Gucci glasses  
A widow spreads her lover's ashes  
I hold on to you, hold on to me, yeah  
  
We'll do it, we'll do it, if we're lucky then we'll do it again  
  
Ah, look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
Ain't it a beautiful world  
Oh ain't it a beautiful world  
Oh ain't it a beautiful world
