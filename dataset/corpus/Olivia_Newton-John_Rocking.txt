Hush my baby, sweetly sleep  
Do not cry  
I will sing a lullaby  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Feel my arms that keep you warm  
Snuggling around your tiny form  
Precious baby, sweetly sleep  
Sleep in peace  
Sleep in comfort, slumber deep  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Close your eyes my darling one  
'Til the new day has begun  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Sleep in peace 'til day has come  
Darling, darling, little one
