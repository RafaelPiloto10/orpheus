Got a million reasons to run and hide  
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)  
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you  
  
Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)  
If I could change the stories ending to me and you  
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do  
  
[Chorus]  
I could be the one  
Give you all my love  
Forget what he has done to you  
I'm here now  
Open up to me  
Love will set you free  
If ever you believe then  
Please believe in me  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby, this is us  
  
I know everything isn't meant to last  
Box up all those photographs  
Your moving on, yeah  
I could flip back over that hour glass  
And refill the better half (the better half)  
  
And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend  
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone  
Would you let your past go  
I'll take it slow  
'Cause there's no need to rush when I know
