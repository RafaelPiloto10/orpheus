You're beautiful eyes,  
Sparkle like two diamonds on fire  
Why am I still surprised  
At the way they make me feel  
Thought I could get no higher  
If you showed me a whole new deal  
  
It's not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
  
Most any old time,  
Could be a special occasion  
Just call me  
And I'm already halfway there  
You choose the destination,  
I'll go with you anywhere  
  
It's not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
  
Like I'm all you ever wanted me to be  
Its not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me
