Traditional  
  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
His face so soft and wondrous fair  
The purest eyes  
  
And the strongest hands  
I love the ground on where he stands  
I love the ground on where he stands  
  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Of my true love's hair  
Of my true love's hair  
  
Oh, I love my lover  
And well he knows  
Yes, I love the ground on where he goes  
And still I hope  
  
That the time will come  
When he and I will be as one  
When he and I will be as one  
  
So black is the color of my true love's hair  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Black is the color of my true love's hair
