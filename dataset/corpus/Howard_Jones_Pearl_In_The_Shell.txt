And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
Under his nose was a dream come true  
Been there all the time and he almost knew.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
Under his nose was a dream come true. ..  
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well  
  
His duty was to use it - left his pearl in the shell.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .
