(Feat. Lil' Scrappy)  
  
[Intro:]  
Uh  
Got 'em swaggin' daddy  
Haha  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Girl)  
Hey nigga what yo hood like?  
  
(Guy)  
Money come, money go, but it's alright  
In the club, stay crunk right  
Drama pop, you pop the truck, get them pumped right?  
(Repeat)  
  
[Ll Cool J]  
I am the most incredible  
I ain't disrespectin, just spittin my track record  
Way before 'Pac and B. I. G., I did it big  
Way before Hova, ll was a casanova  
Way before Nas, I had my first menage  
Way before T. I., I taught him how to be fly  
Way before Nelly, I was up in the telly  
Before J. D., I was 'Jingling Baby'  
Before Lil' Jon, I put the south on  
Before Ludacris, Ya boy was doin this  
Before Snoop Dogg, I put rappers in the morgue  
Before Dr. Dre, I was hot in L. A.  
Before 50 Cent, I was sittin on ends  
A young buck ridin in a 560 Benz  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Ll Cool J]  
I been doin this a long time man, I'm tired of gettin money  
On second thought...  
Before Master P, I was bout it bout it B  
Before Cash Money, I already stashed money  
Before dmx, I was wild on the set  
Momma Should Knock 'em out, I lay 'em on the deck  
Before Wu Tang, I was the new thang  
I whispered on shorty ear before Ying Yang  
Before Mobb Deep, I had 'em shook over the beat  
Years before Busta, I had my first customer  
I was little L before Big L  
Before E-40, my name, shit was naughty  
Before Diddy, all my whips was pretty  
Lil' wild nigga from Queens runnin through the city  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Ll Cool J]  
But I can't talk to greasy  
Gotta keep it real, ya know  
Grandmaster was flashin way before I cashed in  
Ya man Bambaata made the park jams hotter  
Ya man Elle El couldn't go outside  
When ya boy Melle Mel had the pimped out ride  
Way before me, Kurtis Blow stacked dough  
He ruled the world, I was in the front row  
Run-D. M. C. Showed me what I wanna be  
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee  
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three  
Ain't give a damn about a snotty nose kid like me  
Houdhini, The Fat Boys and all that  
I hit 'em on the jack, them niggas never called back  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Outro:]  
I want to dedicate the song  
To everybody who came before me  
And everybody that they came after me  
If I ain't matchin' you  
Blame it on a head not the heart  
This is real  
Ll Cool J in the building baby  
Hey yo 50  
You know you're my favorite gangsta right  
Hahaha  
Yeah we gettin' this  
Just keep gettin' money baby  
Hip hop for life you heard me?  
My name is ll Cool J!  
Better known is the truth  
Oh!
