Hot sun as warm as the kissing of the wind  
Fooststeps in perfect time  
Heartbeat as loud as the whisper in the wood  
Hold me this dance is mine  
The dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love excites me  
You are the earth moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
We climb up into the shelter of the sky  
Footsteps on higher ground  
Your voice as soft as a river running dry  
Hold me this dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love's exciting me  
You are the earth, moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain
