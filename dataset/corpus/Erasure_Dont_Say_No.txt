Collecting conversation from the silence of the room  
Misguided information telling lies will never do  
  
No better known occasion for improving the score  
Paid my contribution won't play this game no more  
  
I'm done with hesitating got no stationary blues  
Gonna use my imagination like the way I used to do  
  
Headlong into passion a sensational move  
Made the right connection I'm falling for the groove  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm swinging high and I'm swinging low  
And I'm getting down and I'm to and fro  
And that's the way the party goes  
  
I'm making no mistaking it's a true love picture show  
So forget the final curtain and forget the bitter blow  
  
Got a lot of combination it's a fusion of love  
Mention intervention been bitten by the bug  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm done with hesitating got no stationary blues  
Gonna use my imagination like the way I used to do  
  
Headlong into passion a sensational move  
Made the right connection I'm falling for the groove  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And that's the way the party goes  
And that's the way the party goes
