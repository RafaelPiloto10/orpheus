Shadows of doubt consume you  
The light you barely see  
Growing wings of sorrow,  
Have brought you to the winds of plague  
Increscent boundaries fade the way  
  
A barren future all too real  
And still I try to seek up and find the flame  
And still I try inside  
  
It's endless  
A barren future all too real  
And still I try  
Endless Fight  
Endless Tragedy  
Endless Lunacy  
  
Chalk up the past as a memory  
This battering sickness has surely won  
All I have i have wasted  
  
Will this erase me  
Time to clean my wounds  
Can I win this battle inside and out  
Can I win this battle inside-out  
  
Endless fight  
Endless tragedy  
Endless lunacy
