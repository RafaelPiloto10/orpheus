There's a friend who will call  
When her husband's asleep  
Crossing the phone lines for comfort  
And she cries that she needs him and  
  
Someday he'll change  
And now's not a good time to go  
And it isn't my place to say leave him and run  
That no love is worth all the damage he's done  
  
But if she'll hold her ground  
Then I'll hold my tongue,ever the diplomat  
Oh, I'd like to think  
That I would be stronger than that  
  
Where's her head?  
Where's her nerve?  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves?  
Oh,I would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
It started out good,they usually do  
Then one day,it's taken for granted  
'Til words become weapons and love turns to pain  
Oh,why is she still holding on  
  
She says living without him is too hard to face  
And I try to imagine myself in her place  
But with well chosen words and well placed tears  
She forgives him in two seconds flat  
  
Oh,I'd like to think  
That I would be stronger than that  
  
Where's her head?  
Where's her nerve?  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves?  
Oh, I would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
I know what she's thinking and I know what she'd say  
That my life and her life are like night and like day  
And her love is the love that will save him  
Brave words but I don't believe them  
  
Where's her head?  
Where's her nerve?  
Does part of her think this is all she deserves?  
Oh, I would be stronger  
I would not stay one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that  
  
Oh, I would be stronger  
I would not wait one minute longer  
I would be stronger than that
