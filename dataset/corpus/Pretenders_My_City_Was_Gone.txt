I went back to Ohio  
But my city was gone  
There was no train station  
There was no downtown  
South Howard had disappeared  
All my favorite places  
My city had been pulled down  
Reduced to parking spaces  
A, o, way to go Ohio  
  
Well I went back to Ohio  
But my family was gone  
I stood on the back porch  
There was nobody home  
I was stunned and amazed  
My childhood memories  
Slowly swirled past  
Like the wind through the trees  
A, o, oh way to go Ohio  
  
I went back to Ohio  
But my pretty countryside  
Had been paved down the middle  
By a government that had no pride  
The farms of Ohio  
Had been replaced by shopping malls  
And Muzak filled the air  
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls  
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio
