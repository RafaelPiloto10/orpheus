Evil ways of practice may surround you  
Callin' on your inner core of life  
But your father was just a complex man of bus'ness  
And your mother merely portioned out your fright  
But run the risk of a sudden loss  
You got no mama to bear your cross beside you  
Uh huh, uh huh  
As midnight angels shine their wings  
And time begins just bo build a wall around you  
  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
  
Settin' out on a voyage down to jenner  
I've given all I've got to help the cause  
Need a place just to settle out my pressures  
A place where you and I can sit and pause  
So I can see the sky at night  
Without a fear of hidden light to blind me  
Mm, mm  
And so you see the path is clear  
And changes will be swayed around me  
  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me
