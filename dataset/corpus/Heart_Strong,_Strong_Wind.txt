We walked away before, there were too many storms  
We could not get through, but I still kept loving you  
Now fate brought you back to me, this time I won't let you leave  
I'm holding on to you, forever, I'm never letting go  
The time I spent away from you, was time that made me see  
I need to live my life with you, I need you here with me  
And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time, it would take a strong, strong wind  
Hearts sometimes lose their way, but they find their way back someday  
To the arms they need and I need you like the air I breathe  
The time I spent away from you was time lost in the rain  
I'm meant to live my life with you, that's something nothing can change  
It would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to tear away this heart of mine  
Make us break apart this time, yeah, it would take a strong, strong wind  
This time I'm holding on with everything  
This time I won't let go for anything  
And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time, it would take a strong, strong wind  
Yeah baby, it would take a strong, strong wind
