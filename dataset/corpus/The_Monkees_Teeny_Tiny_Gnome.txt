Kickin' stones on an old dirt road  
Feelin' d-dejected and all alone  
When I looked up ahead thought my mind I'd blown  
On a giant toadstool sat a teeny tiny gnome  
  
He was all involved in a game of solitaire  
Said "hello" with a smile just like I wasn't there  
I kicked dirt some more  
He said "please don't start a fight."  
Found a church key in his pocket, he opened up his pipe  
  
He blew some silver circles,  
Wound his fingers in his beard  
And from that pipe came magic music  
Like I'd never heard  
  
As the notes came floatin' in I pricked up both my ears  
I walked up to the drive-in, hadn't felt so starved in years  
A rabbit waiter took my order and quickly disappeared  
He said "the party's over,  
Please come back in a thousand years."
