(Originally recorded by Diamond Head)  
  
I'm gonna be a rock'n'roll star  
Gotta groove from night to day  
Gotta blow my crumby job  
Gotta blow my blues away  
  
I'm gonna make a stand  
Gonna make a million  
Gonna make it with you  
I'm gonna be right my friend  
I'm gonna push it through, ooh, oh, yeah  
  
It's electric  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, oo-ooh, yeah  
  
I stop on red, but I leave on amber, danger face my way  
I'm gonna make it my friend  
Gonna make it today  
Gotta get this dust from my hills down the highway I go  
Gotta get the stars from my route  
Make it in a rock'n'roll show, oo-ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
It's electric  
It's electric, yo  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, wo-oh  
  
I stop on red, but I leave on amber, danger face my way  
I'm gonna make it my friend  
Gonna make it today  
Gotta get the dust from my hills down the highway I go  
Gotta get the stars from my route  
Make it in a rock'n'roll show, ooh  
  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yeah  
It's electric, yo, ooh, yeah
