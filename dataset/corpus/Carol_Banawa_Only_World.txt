Ooh hooh, ahh, ahhhh...  
  
It is time to change our ways  
Speak a one united phrase  
In every song that we sing  
In every dream that we dream  
Telling it is up to us to decide  
  
All the conflicts in our hearts  
Let's forget the way it starts  
Let's be together like then  
Together hand and hand  
For this world can be stronger again  
  
For we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
All the conflicts in our hearts  
Let's forget the way it starts  
Let's be together like then  
Together hand and hand  
For this world can be stronger again  
  
For we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Oooh one love is all that we need  
Oooh one earth is all that we have  
We were given hearts to love  
By the heavens up above  
  
Yeah... Yeah  
  
Ooh we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Ooh we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Ooh let's cherish  
The only world we have
