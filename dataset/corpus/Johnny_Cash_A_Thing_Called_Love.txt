Six foot six he stood on the ground,  
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds,  
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.  
He was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck,  
Look you in the eye and never back up,  
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Most men are like me, they struggle in doubt,  
They trouble their minds day in and day out,  
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love.  
But when I see a mother's tenderness,  
As she holds her young close to her breast,  
Then I thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.
