Here is my heart for Christmas  
Take it with love and a kiss  
I can't give you anymore than this  
  
Here is my heart for Christmas  
Sent with devotion to you  
All wrapped up in mistletoe for two  
  
(?) in the season for giving  
And send you all my reason for living  
  
Here is my heart, yes, for Christmas  
And may I ask in return  
Won't you fill my holiday with (?)  
And let me love you each and every day, each year?
