And by the way before you go  
I'd like to say  
I love you so  
If it's goodbye maybe for good  
I will not cry  
Maybe I should  
And I  
I love you so  
Oh how this year has slipped away  
We shed no tears  
So why today  
And all this time has made me feel  
Love is no crime  
And love is real  
And I  
Ooh! and I love you so  
And I ooh I love you so  
Remember me when you're far away  
I'll remember you  
No matter where I stay  
And by the way before you go  
I like to say  
I love you so  
And all this time has made me feel  
Love is no crime and love is real  
Maybe I should  
And I  
I ooh I love you  
I ooh I love you so  
Ooh I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you and I love you baby  
More then words can say  
I know you can't stay  
I love you anyway  
Baby I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you babe  
I got to say  
Anyway I love you baby
