Have you found your way around the down and out?  
I know it must seem long, so long  
I'm still trying' to keep this time from runnin' out  
Head down, always movin' on and on and on  
I never heard this warnin'  
  
Another early mornin' takes me, wakes me into  
If you could manage me, I'll try to manage you  
But lately it's all I ever do  
I felt like this on my way home  
  
I'm not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'  
I know these things must bore you  
I can't find another way  
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'  
I love this leash that holds me  
When I try to run away  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared,  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared,  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared,  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
I'm not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
I'm not scared
