  
here comes that new girl everybody,  
Check her out  
She wants to be part of the city  
Well, I'll treat that girl just like a queen  
She looks kinda like a hopeless drug fiend  
[chorus]  
Hey new girl you just arrived in town  
Hey new girl can I show you around  
Let me show you the lights of the city  
Let me show you every avenue  
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids do  
here comes that new girl everybody,  
Check her out  
She looks real cool, just like one of us  
Comes from New Jersey, just like all of us  
Every freak in town wants ???  
???  
[chorus]  
well I see your eyes wondering  
If your, missing anything  
C'mon girl and find out  
What the rock n' roll kids are all about  
[chorus x3]
