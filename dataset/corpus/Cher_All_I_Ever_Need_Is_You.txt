Sometimes when I'm down and all alone  
Just like a child without a home.  
The love you give me keeps me hanging on, oh honey  
All I ever need is you.  
  
You're my first love you're my last.  
You're my future you're my past.  
And loving you is all I ask,oh honey  
All I ever need is you.  
  
Winters come and they go,  
And we watch the melting snow.  
Sure as summer follows spring  
All the things you do  
Give me a reason to build my world around you.  
  
Some men follow rainbows I am told.  
Some men search for silver, some for gold.  
I have found my treasure in your soul honey  
All I ever need is you.  
  
Without love i'd never find a way,  
Through ups and downs of every single day.  
I won't sleep at night until you say my honey,  
All i ever need is you.
