Mop mop! A thousand years ago  
Mop mop! A guy named Jungle Joe  
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band  
That made swing history  
  
Mop mop! One day the king said "Gate!  
Why Gate, you old reprobate  
I commission you, find a riff that's new  
Or your wig belongs to me."  
  
Joe's knees started knockin'  
So scared he was stiff  
'Til he noticed the tribe was rockin'  
As his knees beat out this mellow riff  
  
Mop mop! From the tropic's heat  
Mop mop! Came this jungle beat  
Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on  
And it still is making history.
