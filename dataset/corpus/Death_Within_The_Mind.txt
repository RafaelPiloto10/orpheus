Transforming your mind from the inside out  
Overcoming fear that made you doubt  
Observing what is stored in the subconscious  
Trusting what you feel with your gut responses  
  
See past the dark and use your energy  
Learn from these images  
Thoughts that we call dreams  
  
This power lies within the mind  
Gain wisdom through abilities  
Change what's to come in future time  
Avoiding pain and misery  
  
Look through the fake from what is real  
Making decisions by what you feel  
Live for the future and not the past  
The weak of mind will never last  
  
Perceiving visions that reoccur  
Analise your dreams to gain  
A better perspective of your life  
In control of your destiny with mind and soul  
  
See past the dark and use your energy  
Learn from these images  
Thoughts that we call dreams  
  
This power lies within the mind  
Gain wisdom through abilities  
Change what's to come in future time  
Avoiding pain and misery
