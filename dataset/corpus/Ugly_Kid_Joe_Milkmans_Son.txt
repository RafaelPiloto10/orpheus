Let the burning bridges tumble down,  
Let the water come and flood the ground,  
Burn a hole into this auburn sky,  
I only wanna be walking by your side.  
  
When I see tomorrow I see you there,  
When I look around I see you everywhere,  
Your face is etched into my mind,  
And when it's all said and done,  
I'm feeling like the milkman's son.  
  
Let your dark spirits fly away,  
Come again but you won't count again,  
Spend the last time of my worthless life,  
I only wanna be walking by your side.  
  
When I see tomorrow I see you there,  
When I look around I see you everywhere,  
Your face is etched into my mind,  
And when it's all said and done,  
I'm feeling like the milkman's son.
