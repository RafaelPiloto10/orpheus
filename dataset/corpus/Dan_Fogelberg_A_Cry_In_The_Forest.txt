There's a cry in the forest, it's feathered and brown  
And it echoes off of nothing as the trees come down  
It's the sound of a sparrow hittin' the ground  
It's the sound of one eternity bound  
It's the sound of one eternity bound  
There's a cry in the oceans, it's plaintive and blue  
And it rises from the depths, breaks my heart in two  
It's the dreams of the great whales running aground  
For they know that they're eternity bound  
For they know that they're eternity bound  
Whoa eternity bound  
Once they've passed into the timeless, they can never more be found  
Is there anybody listening, tell me can you hear the sound  
Of the gentle ones eternity bound  
Of the gentle ones eternity bound  
There's a cry in the heart of every woman and man  
We've been crying in the darkness since the world began  
Will we ever seek forgiveness, will we ever earn the crown  
Or are we in turn eternity bound  
Or are we in turn eternity bound  
Whoa eternity bound  
Once we've past into the timeless, we can never more be found  
Is there anybody listening, tell me can you hear the sound  
Of the lonely ones eternity bound  
Of the lonely ones eternity bound  
Of the lonely ones eternity bound
