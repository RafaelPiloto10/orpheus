Cause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)  
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Weezy)  
  
Mad trees and bitches in dungarees  
The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees  
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze  
I'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's  
I sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall  
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball  
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right  
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life  
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife  
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork  
So be smart and play your own part  
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart  
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell  
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail  
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich  
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6  
  
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life  
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
  
[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]  
It's showdown time, throwdown time  
Same d-off, four pound time  
Clack Clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine  
Check it man, I'm wit whatever  
Goodness gracious the paper  
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?  
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me  
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see  
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down  
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now  
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred  
Keep it coming til I'm full on my stomach  
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my hase  
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays  
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga  
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?  
  
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life  
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
