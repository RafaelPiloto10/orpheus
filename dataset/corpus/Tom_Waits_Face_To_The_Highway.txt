I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
  
The cradle wants a baby  
Kitchen wants a pan  
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can  
  
The ocean wants a sailor  
The gun wants a hand  
Money wants a spender  
And the road wants a man  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
Devil wants a sinner  
The sky wants a bird  
The table wants the dinner  
Lips want a word  
  
Glass wants the wine  
Fist wants to hurt  
Clock wants the time  
And the shovel wants to work  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
Going away  
Going away  
  
Coal wants a miner  
Soldier takes a stand  
The walls of the prison  
Want a solitary man  
The window wants a curtain  
The plow wants the land  
Diamond ring wants to  
Fit upon the finger of her hand  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
Going away  
Going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away
