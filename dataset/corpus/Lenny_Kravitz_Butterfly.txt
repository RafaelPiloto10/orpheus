You are the most beautiful thing  
I've ever seen  
You shine just like sunlight rays  
On a winter snow  
I just had to tell you so  
  
Your eyes sparkle as the stars  
Like the moon they glow  
Your smile could light the world on fire  
Or did you know ?  
  
Your mind's full of everything  
That I want to know  
I just had to let you know  
I just had to tell you so  
You're my butterfly  
Fly high  
Fly fly fly
