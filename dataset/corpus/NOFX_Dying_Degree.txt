Dresser drawers are filled with pocket change  
Coupons cut, smokes down to the butt  
Is this what dreams are made!?  
  
Adding up subtracting down you find  
Yourself sucking the rind  
  
Dying degree, graying amie  
  
Final payment made - had you forgot?  
The rightful owner of one deluxe cemetery plot  
Paisley satin lined how apprapoe  
What a better way to go  
  
Dying degree, graying amie  
  
No more eating crumbs  
When my pension finally comes  
You kids won't eat mush anymore 'round me  
  
Dying degree, graying amie
