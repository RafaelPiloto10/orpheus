If it's love that you're running from  
There is no hiding place  
Just your problems, no one else's problems  
Could just have to face  
  
If you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind  
We're gonna walk and don't look back  
Gonna walk and don't look back  
  
Now if your first love has let you down  
There's something can be done  
Don't you have your faith in love  
Remembering what been gone  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind  
Gonna walk and don't look back  
We're gonna walk and don't look back  
If you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind  
We're gonna walk and don't look back  
Gonna walk and don't look back  
  
Places behind you  
There to remind you  
If your first love have broke your heart  
There's something can be done  
Don't have your faith in love  
Remembering what's been gone  
  
But if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind  
Gonna walk and don't look back  
We're gonna walk and don't look back
