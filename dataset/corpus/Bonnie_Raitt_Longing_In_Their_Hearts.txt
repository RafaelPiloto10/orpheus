Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine  
He's a short order cook  
Long on speed and he's short on spice  
He reads his customers like a book  
He's seen this, and he's done that  
And now he's makin' fried eggs an art  
But there's one thing he can't fix no how  
There's a longing in his heart  
Tried for years to work it out  
At the grill and at his home  
Talks to his friends, he talks to himself  
He'd talk the chicken right off the bone  
Talks to his woman and she understands  
You know they're always eye to eye  
Well, she runs the joint, they live out back  
It's a small house under a big sky  
And even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin' apart  
And she knows 'cause she can feel it too  
There's a longing in her heart  
Longing in her heart  
Well, you and me, we're just like them  
We never wanted to be alone  
So we made a pact, sealed with desire  
For a happier house and home  
Only to find, it doesn't untie  
The knot where feelings die  
There's a longing deep inside our hearts  
Oh, and no one to tell us why  
Well, our friends ain't lookin' for anything new  
You know, they wouldn't know where to look  
Well, her, she likes runnin' that joint  
And he likes bein' a cook  
Together they're doin' very well  
You know they're mighty glad they could  
Well, there's a fire burnin' and it's towards them now  
Comin' from a distant wood  
Even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin' apart  
We know 'cause we can feel it too  
There's a longing in our hearts  
Longing in our hearts, longing in our hearts
