And, when I hold you in my arms I promise you  
You're gonna feel a love that's beautiful and new  
This time I'll love you even better  
Than I ever did before  
And you'll be in my heart forever more  
  
We, we're just too young to know  
We fell in love and let it go  
So easy to say the words goodbye  
So hard to let the feeling die  
  
I know how much I need you now  
The time is turning back somehow  
As soon as our hearts and souls unite  
I know for sure we'll get the feeling right  
  
[Chorus]  
And now we're starting over again  
It's not the easiest thing to do  
I'm feeling inside again  
"Cause every time I look at you  
I know we're starting over again  
This time we'll love all the pain away  
Welcome home my lover and friend  
We are starting over, over again  
  
If we never lived alone  
Then we might have never known  
All of the time we spent apart  
All we did was break each other's hearts  
  
And when I hold you in my arms I promise you  
You're gonna feel a love that's beautiful and new  
This time I'll love you even better  
Than I ever did before  
And you'll be in my heart forevermore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now we're starting over again  
This time we'll chase all the rain away  
Welcome home my lover and friend  
We are starting over, over again  
We are starting over, over again
