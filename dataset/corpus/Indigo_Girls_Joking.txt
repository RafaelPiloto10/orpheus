You said the world was magic  
I was wide-eyed and laughing  
We were dancing up to the bright side  
Forget about your ego  
Forget about your pride  
And you will never have to compromise  
And you were only joking  
You were only joking brother  
  
We talked about our mothers  
Kissed the wounds of our fathers  
I could have been your sister  
I would have been your brother  
You kissed me like I was a soldier  
Headed for a war  
I dying man but I don't know what for  
And you were only joking  
You were only joking brother  
You were only joking  
(Wide-eyed and laughing)  
You were only joking brother  
(Dancing up to the bright side)  
  
Gravel and glass on the bottom of my feet  
I bruised my heels on the swollen street  
We were girls in bars  
Boys on the town  
Bumping like a pinball off a careless crowd  
You said good friends are hard to come by  
I laughed and bought you a beer  
It's too corny to cry  
Well sentiment given  
Oh sentiment lost  
You shake it off with a smirk and a toss  
And you were only joking  
You were only joking brother  
You were only joking  
Were only joking brother  
And you were only joking  
(gravel and glass on the bottom of my feet)  
You were only joking brother  
(I bruised my heels on the swollen street)  
You kissed me like a soldier heading for a war  
(Joking)  
I'm a dying man  
(You were only joking)  
And you were only joking  
(Don't know what for)  
(Dying man)  
You were only joking brother  
(Don't know what for)  
And you were only  
And you were only  
And you were only joking  
Brother  
  
One two three four  
  
Ah yeah  
  
(Wide eyed and laughing)  
Sha la  
(Dancing up to the bright side)  
Sha la  
(wide eyed and laughing)  
Sha la  
(dancing up to the bright side)
