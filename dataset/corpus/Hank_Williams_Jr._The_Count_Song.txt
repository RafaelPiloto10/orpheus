One, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
Let's kiss and make up and start over again  
  
Now we've all said and done things that we didn't mean  
We get a little mad and we make a big scene  
Oh yes I know it's kinda hard to go back  
Be like Perry Mason though and get all the facts  
  
One, two, three four, honey don't get mad and walk out like before  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better make love girl before it's too late  
Nine, ten, can I come in  
Let's kiss and make up and start all over again  
  
Since Adam and Eve men and women have disagreed  
Love me or leave me ah that is the key  
We got to control our temper to win  
Why you son of a... Whoops, count slowly to ten  
  
Sing one, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
Let's kiss and make up and start over again  
  
One more  
One, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
We've kissed and made up and are happy again
