It is Sunday morning, well right before dawn  
A little girl is dancing, on the mansion "porch"  
She calls out a name, "God give him the sea"  
I'm here from the darkest deep  
And hear my name  
  
Down by the lake, there's the shadow of grief  
Dancing hand in hand with the Devil  
  
Watching from the bridge, the one near by the lake  
Why sister Margaret? No need the hate  
Yes, we all know, "light your seventh cross"  
Oh please do it my dear  
While you're lost  
  
Down by the lake  
Dancing hand in hand  
  
And the nun has been seen  
I want your cross  
Now come and play  
Sister Margaret  
  
Follow "pry", the nun won't give in  
She catched us along  
Scared as Hell, the little girl is screaming  
When sister Margaret disappeared in the lake  
  
Down by the lake, there's the shadow of happiness  
Dancing hand in hand with the Devil
