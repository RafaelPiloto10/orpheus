Five little monsters were riding through space  
Their spaceship broke and they fell into this place  
They gotta get out but they don't know how  
So they're waiting and waiting in a creepy creepy house  
The whole human race is already pretty loony  
But the ones who move in this house are gonna go boony  
Monsters live on tv never in the zoo  
Hang around with us and you'll be a monster too  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Poor old stereo he ain't sure just what he knows  
Etno is intelligent he's quite a super-head  
Gorgious is a great big guy but he's fat from too much pie  
Bud is cool of course it's true but he's a tv fool  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Candy is the sweetest one cleans and cooks and acts like mom  
All of them are going nutz their spaceship's on the futz  
The human race gets in their face gotta drive the from this place  
Of course they've got smtv nightmares for the family  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Gotta get and ride home baby gotta get and ride now  
Gotta get and ride home baby but they don't know how  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men  
Lalala lalalala we like monster men
