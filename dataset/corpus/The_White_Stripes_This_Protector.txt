But now  
But now  
But now  
Now, now, now, now, now  
You thought you heard a sound  
There's no one else around  
Looking at the door  
It's coming through the floor  
  
Three hundred people living out in West Virginia  
Have no idea of all these thoughts  
That lie within you  
But now  
But now  
But now  
Now, now, now, now, now  
You thought you heard a sound  
There's no one else around  
Looking at the door  
It's coming through the floor
