You could sail across the water take the kids and set me free  
You could die and go to heaven but you'll always live inside of me  
You'll always live inside of me girl you'll always live inside of me  
No one else will ever take your place you'll always live inside of me  
  
They could take me back to prison they could throw away the key  
Just as long as I am breathin' you'll always live inside of me  
You'll always live inside of me girl...  
You'll always live inside of me girl...
