Revolver

Pictures of fields without fences  
A spotless domain  
Hides festering hopes she's certain there's more  
Pictures of fields without fences

As he approaches the door  
As he approaches the door  
As he approaches the door  
As he approaches  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
  
Yeah!  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!  
Revolver!  
Revolver!  
Revolver!  
Revolver
