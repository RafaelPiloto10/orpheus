People always comin' up to me and askin'  
"Dolly, what's your secret?  
With all you do, your attitude  
Just seems to be so good  
How do you keep it?"  
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try  
To offer up a few words of advice  
  
[Chorus]  
You better get to livin', givin'  
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'  
And lovin' on the way  
You better get to knowin', showin'  
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'  
Just a word unto the wise  
You better get to livin'  
  
A girlfriend came to my house  
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening  
She was spinnin' such a sad tale  
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'  
So negative the words she had to say  
I said if I had a violin I'd play  
  
I said you'd better get to livin', givin'  
Be willing and forgivin'  
Cause all healing has to start with you  
You better stop whining, pining  
Get your dreams in line  
And then just shine, design, refine  
Until they come true  
  
And you better get to livin'  
  
Your life's a wreck, your house is mess  
And your wardrobe way outdated  
All your plans just keep on falling through  
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated  
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you  
This I know is true.  
  
You better get to livin', givin'  
A little more thought about bein'  
A little more willin' to make a better way  
Don't sweat the small stuff  
Keep your chin up  
Just hang tough  
And if it gets too rough  
Fall on your knees and pray  
And do that everyday  
Then you'll get to livin'  
  
The day we're born we start to die  
Don't waste one minute of this life  
Get to livin'  
Share your dreams and share your laughter  
Make some points for the great hereafter  
  
Better start carin'  
Better start sharin'  
Better start tryin'  
Better start smiling  
And you better get to livin'...
