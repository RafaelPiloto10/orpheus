It reads like a fairytale, and that's what it was  
Young man in his prime, young girl from the cross  
The most perfect of strangers, and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Now she was a fine one, and he was a handsome man  
One look was enough, and away they ran  
They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Oh what's the use in complaining?  
In for a penny, in for a pound  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts  
  
And I recall the promise they made  
With a faith I can but admire  
That she'd be the one he adored  
And he'd be her heart's desire  
  
It didn't come true in the end, they went their separate ways  
He couldn't change what he was, she wasn't ready to wait  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts
