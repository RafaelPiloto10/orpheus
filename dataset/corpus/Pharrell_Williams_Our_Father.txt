Our Father, which art in heaven  
I'm so grateful  
Of all the beautiful things  
That you are allowing me to see  
Birds, bees  
The ability to do what I do  
The opportunities  
I know you love me now  
And I think it's time  
And my duty,to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you,oh)  
  
Don't let me fall  
You watch for who I'm friends with  
I got tattoos ,you forgive me  
You know I'm so sensitive  
You know I'm chased by women  
You know mt mind is drivin'  
To you my heart is givin', oowww  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the greatest  
You're the greatest (wow wow)  
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)  
You're the greatest  
Don't let me fall  
  
They don't understand  
What you do for me (do foe me)  
And nothing by my actions  
They don't I believe (I believe)  
Not talking 'bout what I wear  
When I drivin' where I sleep  
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for my brothers  
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)
