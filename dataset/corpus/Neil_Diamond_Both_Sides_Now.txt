Rolls and flows of angel hair  
Ice cream castles in the air  
Feather canyons everywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain, they snow on everyone  
So many things I would've done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
It's clouds' illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy, dancing way you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
But now it's just another show  
Leave 'em laughin' when you go  
But if you care, don't let em' know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
Say "I love you" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
I've looked at life that way  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads and say I've changed  
But something's lost when somethings gained  
Living everyday  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all
