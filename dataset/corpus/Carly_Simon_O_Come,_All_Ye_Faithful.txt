O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
  
O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
Sing, choirs of angels  
Sing in exhalation  
O sing all ye citizens of Heav'n above  
  
Glory to God  
Glory in the Highest  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee  
Born this happy morning  
Oh Jesus, to Thee be a glory giv'n  
  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant
