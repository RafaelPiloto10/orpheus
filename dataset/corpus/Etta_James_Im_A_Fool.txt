Oh, oh, yes  
Oh, oh, yes  
  
I'm a fool to love you, I'm a fool to care  
But I know some, someday baby  
You will be a fool just like me, just like me  
  
I'm a fool to cry my heart out over someone like you  
But I know some, someday baby  
You will be a fool just like me, just like me  
  
I'm a fool to want you when you hate me all the time  
I'm a fool to let you get under my skin  
But I can't get you out of my mind  
  
I'm a fool to need you when I know you don't care  
But I know some, someday baby  
You will be a fool just like me, just like me  
  
But I can't get you out of my mind  
  
I'm a fool to need you when I know you don't care  
But I know some, someday baby  
You will be a fool just like me, [?] just like me  
Just like me, don't you know just like me, just like me
