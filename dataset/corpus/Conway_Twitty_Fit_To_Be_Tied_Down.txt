I've always been the travelin' kind  
Another town was on my mind  
It's not my fault that I was just  
Born with a case of wonder lust.  
  
But, I'm changing fast  
You'll put it all in my past  
No more running around  
Feel like I'm fit to be tied down.  
  
I've loved some women in my time  
So, I'll leave some broken hearts behind  
I know they'll cuss me that much more  
But, I've found what I've been searchin' for.  
  
Cause, I'm changing fast  
You'll put it all in my past  
No more running around  
I'm finally fit to be tied down.  
  
Feel like I'm fit to be tied down...
