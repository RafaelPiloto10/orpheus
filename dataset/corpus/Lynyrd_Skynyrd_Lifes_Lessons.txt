Mmm...  
I listen, and still I haven't heard  
Tell me what is the word  
And if I ever heard it would it be clear as water  
Oh tears run down your face  
Reflects the human race  
We're all caught up with winnin' losin' time and space  
  
Life's lessons  
So you think you know it all  
But you're headin' for a fall  
Ooh to make it back again  
You'll have to crawl and step back  
Take a look around  
Are your feet still on the ground  
Can we find you in the section of lost and found  
  
Never think you got it figured out  
'Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
It's time for you to open your eyes  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Or is this another life's lesson... Too late  
  
Oohh...  
Never think you've got it figured out  
'Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
It's time for you to open your eyes  
  
Oohh...  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Is this another life's lesson... Too late  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Oohh...Oohh...  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Oohh life's lessons  
Oohh...Oohh...Oohh yeah life's lessons  
Oohh... life's lessons  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we realize we all share one fate
