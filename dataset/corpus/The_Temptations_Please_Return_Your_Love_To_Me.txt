Please return your love to me, girl  
Forgive me for the wrong I've done  
  
And, oh, baby  
I cry myself to sleep at night  
For fear of a-never holdin' you tight at all, baby (whoa, baby)  
I miss ya more with each passin' day  
Every night on my knees I pray  
Oh, oh, baby (please)  
  
Return your love to me, girl  
Forgive me for the wrong I've done  
Without your love, I'm just no good  
For I am just a lonely boy  
  
I'm sorry for the wrong I've done  
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone (whoa, baby)  
I need you more than words can say  
Without your love I can't face another day  
Oh, (please)  
  
Return your love to me, girl  
Forgive me for the wrong I've done  
Without your love, I'm just no good  
I am just a lonely one  
  
Oh, no, no-o-o-o, babe  
If there's a heav'n above you'll be my one and only love (and, oh, baby)  
I can't control the glow in me  
Girl, come on and an' see about me  
  
(Oh, ple-ea-ease)  
Return your love to me, girl  
Forgive me for the wrong I've done  
Without your love, I'm just no good  
I am just a lonely one  
  
I'm a lonely one  
I'm a lonely one  
I'm a lonely one  
I'm just a lonely... one...  
(I am just a)  
  
Please, return your love to me, girl  
Forgive me for the wrong I've done  
Without your love, I'm just no good  
I am just a lonely one  
[Fade...]
