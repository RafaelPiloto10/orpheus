There was a time when I  
Could breath my life into you  
One by one your pale fingers  
Started to move  
And I touched your face  
And all death was erased  
And you smiled like an angel  
Fallen from heaven, oh -  
Just to be lifted up again, ohh  
  
And you kissed my lips  
With those once cold fingertips  
You brought me back to life  
And all things come to an end  
We don't have to pretend  
Slowly we fall asleep  
And never wake up again, oh oh ohh  
  
We're so Christ like  
So lifelike  
Vampire Christ  
  
We're so lifelike  
So Christlike  
Vampire Christ  
  
In the grace  
Of our love  
We writhe in pain  
And death is not far away  
And soon we'll sleep  
And never wake up again  
  
Shhh...  
  
There was a time when I  
Could breathe my life  
Into you  
And all things come to an end, oh  
We all have to pretend  
Slowly we fall asleep  
  
And we're Christlike  
So lifelike  
A Vampire Christ  
  
We're so lifelike  
So Christlike  
A Vampire Christ
