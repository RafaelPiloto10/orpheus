I'll get by, as long as I have you  
Though there'll be rain and darkness too  
I'll not complain, I'll live with you  
  
Poverty, may come to me, that's true  
But what care I  
I'll get by, as long as I have you  
  
I'll get by, as long as I have you  
Though there'll be rain and darkness too  
I'll not complain, I'll live with you  
  
Poverty may come to me, that's true  
But what care I  
I'll get by, as long as I have you
