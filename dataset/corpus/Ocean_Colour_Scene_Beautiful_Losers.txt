Your dream make up is cracked and wearing thin  
Your eyes are on your chin  
It's getting hard for you  
But to make up is only make-believe  
And we don't need a scene like this  
  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
  
Your eyes closed and dreamed of places  
That you and I would go  
It's getting hard for me  
To love you, like I used to  
I don't believe "hello"  
Do you?  
  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers
