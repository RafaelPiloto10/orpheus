Looking for a way  
Maybe now, maybe in a day  
Cause nothing gonna change  
If we stay around here  
  
We gotta do what it takes  
Cause it's all in our hands  
We all make mistakes  
But it's never too late to start again  
  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let them pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
If this life, gets any harder now  
Don't ever mind, you got me by your side  
And any time you want  
We can catch a train and find a better place  
Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down  
  
Maybe you and I  
Should pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let times pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
Do you see a bluer sky now  
You could have a better life now  
Open your eyes  
No one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we won't let them  
No way
