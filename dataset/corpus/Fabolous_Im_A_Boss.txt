Stand up nigga looking down on a slouch

Nigga mad cause his chick in my section  
Take it the wrong way, he dead, die-rection  
Come through in the AM, y'all thought the morning

I dig a chick who 'bout her money, got some ass  
So I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it  
She said "no you fucking don't Fab, you just wanna hit it"  
Okay girl you got me, but I'm with it, if you with it
