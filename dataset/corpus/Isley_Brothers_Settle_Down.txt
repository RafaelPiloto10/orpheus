[Chorus]  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down, settle down babe  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down with me babe  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down, settle down with me babe  
Settle down with me, babe  
Settle down  
  
Would you like a house on the hill  
Overlooking the ocean side  
Tell me, would you like that baby  
Or how about a high-rise apartment  
In Manhattan on the east side  
If that's what you need  
I'm here to please  
Won't you settle down with me, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We could take a jet plane all the way to Spain  
Just to buy you a wedding ring  
Tell me, would you like that baby  
Oh, talk to me girl  
We could get married on Christmas day  
On the shores of Montego Bay  
If that's what you need  
I'm here to please  
Won't you settle down with me  
  
If you're ready  
Only if you're ready  
To settle down, settle down babe  
Tell me if you're ready, ready yeah  
To settle down with me babe  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down, settle down with me babe  
Settle down, settle down  
Settle down  
  
I'm not trying to buy your love  
Money ain't in it  
You can't put a rpice on love  
Tell me if I'm worthy of  
Worthy of you're hand  
Girl let's start making plans  
You're shining like a star above  
You're the light of my life  
Oh girl, be my wife  
Settle down baby  
  
Oh but first  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down, settle down babe  
I wanna know if you're ready, tell me baby  
To settle down with me babe  
Do you think you're ready  
To settle down, settle down with me babe  
Settle down babe  
Settle down  
  
Ooh  
oh, whoa  
Oooh  
No no no no no no no  
Yeah yes  
Oh settle down babe  
Settle down  
  
You tell me when you're ready  
(I'm ready, I'm ready)  
Do you think you're ready  
(I, yes I am baby)  
Please tell me  
(You already know)  
When you're ready  
(Yes I'm ready)  
Then We can settle down  
(Settle down babe)  
Settle down  
(I'm ready)  
I wanna know if you're ready  
Oh wee, oh it feels like you're ready babe  
I can tell if you're ready  
We need to settle down babe  
Settle down
