Now in your big flash motor and your wild reputation  
You're ready to hit the streets  
Winking at the boys, yeah heading for the noise  
Got the world at your feet  
  
If leaving me for dead with a pistol at my head  
Is your idea of how I'd feel  
Well, let me tell you honey before you spend all of your money  
I got my hands firmly on the wheel, yeah  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
Backstreet lover in the cold of the evening  
Takes you to a place he knows  
Says it will be fine, better make up your mind  
You've cut it deep and now it shows  
  
It's way past midnight and you travel through the city  
You wonder what you should do  
Baby can't you see that you've had enough of me  
And I've certainly had enough of you, oh  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It doesn't matter  
It doesn't matter  
It doesn't matter
