All the colors of the rainbow  
All the voices of the wind  
Every dream that reaches out  
Reaches out to find where love begins  
Every word of every story  
Every star in every sky  
Every corner of creation lives to testify  
  
Chorus:  
For as long as I shall live I will testify to love  
I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough  
With every breath I take I'll give thanks to God above  
For as long as l shall live I will testify to love  
  
From the mountains to the valleys  
From the rivers to the seas  
Every hand that reaches out  
Every hand that reaches out to offer peace  
Every simple act of mercy  
Every step to kingdom come  
All the hope in every heart will speak what love has done  
  
Chorus 2
