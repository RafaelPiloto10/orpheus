Michael:  
Your lights are on, but you're not home  
Your mind is not your own  
You can't see, your body shakes  
Another kiss is what it takes  
  
Lily and Michael:  
You can't sleep, you can't eat  
There's no doubt, you're in deep  
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe  
Another kiss is all you need  
  
Blake:  
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to this stuff, oh yeah  
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough  
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love  
  
Aylin:  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to love  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love  
  
All Contenders (Ali singing):  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love (Might as well face it)  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love (You're addicted to love)  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love (You're addicted, you're
addicted, I'm addicted to love)
