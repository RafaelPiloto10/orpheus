Share the time again  
I spend with you  
A friend is always good to have  
But a lover's kiss is better than angels raining down at me  
I dream of you at times when you're by my side  
Dream you're not just like you are  
So troubled and doubling my pain  
Just one more tear  
You she'd for me  
I wish I could climb inside your mind  
And spend some time and hug and hold you  
And mold you into what I'd like  
But no I can't do this  
Just a kiss to spend a while by you  
And your familiar smile and voice  
  
I lay awake  
Then you lean back and smiling  
On you  
Most everything you do for me, I say  
And the while let's make our way  
And feel warm  
In the middle of this storm with you  
Like an angel  
  
Oh, what the friends say is good, is right  
I say  
When you were again  
And you were my friend  
Before the lie  
This one  
Say yes I do  
And with you  
Sometimes  
  
But while I do my best  
With all the rest I leave to you  
Can't wait for the hour  
And when two things become this  
All this trouble from a kiss from you, I'll do it  
And when you come up smiling  
And I'm thrown  
Into I get a little storm with you, I'll do it  
  
Always  
Lover, line up and yeah  
The road to you is long and I've been on it for a while  
And a need a warm embrace  
I'll take a break  
And say I want to leave you awake  
  
Always  
  
I feel tired...
