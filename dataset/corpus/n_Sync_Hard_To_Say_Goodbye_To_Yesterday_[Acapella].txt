How do I say goodbye  
To what we had  
Good times that made us laugh  
Outweighed the bad  
  
I thought we'd get to see forever  
But forevers gone away  
  
It's so hard  
To say goodbye  
To yesterday  
  
I don't know where this road  
Is going to lead  
All I know is where weve been  
And what weve been through  
  
(x2)And I'll take with me the memories  
To be my sunshine after the rain  
  
Well it's so hard  
To say goodbye  
To yesterday
