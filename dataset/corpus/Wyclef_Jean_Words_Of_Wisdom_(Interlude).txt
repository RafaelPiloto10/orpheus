Hello, boys and girls.  
  
Welcome, to Wyclef Words of Wisdom.  
  
Have you ever been sitting in your  
  
house at two o'clock in the morning  
  
and you get a mysterious phone  
  
call from a girl that you don't know? (A female begins talking sexy)  
  
Now, hold on, think with your mind  
  
and not with your pistol.  
  
Cause if you invite her over  
  
this is what might happen:  
  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape! (What the... Yo, yo, yo...shit!)  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
  
Cop: Freeze! Put your hands in the air!  
  
Wyclef: Officer, you don't understand.  
  
She called me. I was sleeping.  
  
I was minding my business.  
  
Cop: I don't give a flying fuck  
  
about two bits about a piss.  
  
You're fuckin' guilty. (Yes, yes)  
  
Wyclef: Nobody's protected.
