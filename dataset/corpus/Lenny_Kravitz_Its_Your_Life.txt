They say that our love is all wrong  
And that we should not carry on  
But I say they're wrong  
I want you so bad  
  
Oh we've been together for so long  
How could they think we don't belong ?  
But they'll never know what you and I have  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Go on and call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
It's your life, it's your life  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
It's your life, it's your life, it's your life  
  
They say that we don't have a chance  
We're victims of unjust romance  
But they could'nt see the truth in their hands  
We don't have to live like they do  
  
We'll run away if we have to  
And we'll start a life that's shining and new  
That's shining and new  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Go on and call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
It's your life, it's your life, it's your life  
[Repeat until end]
