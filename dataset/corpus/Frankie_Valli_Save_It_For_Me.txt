Don't let your love go astray,  
Save it for me  
Don't give your sweet kiss away,  
Save it for me  
I know you're feeling blue,  
'Cause I feel blue like you.  
I'll be strong as you  
Are and wait just as long as you  
Don't waste that look I adore  
Save it for me  
Just wait a little bit more  
Save it for me  
I know that you must cry:  
Cry, baby, so do I.  
Just sit tight  
And leave on your light  
'Cause I'm coming home to your arms,  
Oh baby,  
I'm coming home to your arms.  
Save it for me  
Save it for me  
I know that you must cry:  
Cry, baby, so do I.  
I'll be strong as you  
Are and wait just as long as you  
Save it for me  
Save it for me  
Save it for me
