[Chorus]  
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind  
When I try I 'm just wastin' my time  
Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.  
  
[Chorus]
