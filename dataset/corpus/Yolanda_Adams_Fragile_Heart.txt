I remember the first time, you laughed with me  
And I remember the promises,  
You would never leave my side  
Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy  
Standing here with a fragile heart,  
You see I never shed a tear  
I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did  
When everybody disappears  
It's only you who keeps me strong  
And I can't imagine going on  
Without you in my life,  
Going on with a fragile heart  
  
When I think about,think about life  
Lord I think of you  
I forget about everything else, there's only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up the fight (no, no)  
The only thing that matters Lord, is you  
  
I ain't got no time to pretend  
That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no  
I know you're in good hands  
Same hands that hold my heart  
And I'll cherish every moment we spent  
As a gift from God above  
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts  
  
When I think about, think about life  
Lord I think of you, and I  
Forget about everything else  
There's only you and I  
I can't think about, ever, ever, ever giving up  
For the only thing that matters, when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
  
You see my fragile heart's been broken  
And you're the only one who can put it all together again  
So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through  
  
There's only you and I  
I can't think about ever giving  
I can't give up(up a fight)  
The only thing that matters  
When I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
When I think about my life  
I,I,I,I forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up, No, no, no, no  
The only thing that matters when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.  
  
When I think about my life, I forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up, can't give up  
For the only thing that matter's when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.
