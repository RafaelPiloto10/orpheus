Yeahh  
Ooohh  
Yeah yeah  
  
Once there was a time love was just a myth  
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist  
Til the day you came into my life  
You forced me to think twice  
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich  
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this  
That's why until this day I'm still your man  
Cause you made me understand that  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself  
You connect with me like nobody else  
Even though our circumstances changed  
Our love still remains  
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly  
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely  
So no matter what tomorrow brings  
We got the simple things cause (noooo)  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (bean bag chair)  
The two of us but no one there (no one there)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs (ohh)  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (ohh)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (ohh)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is  
A Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist  
Love is  
The way your lips seem to curve  
When you say my name (say my name ohh)  
Love is  
And when I'm stressing like the world's turning upside down  
Girl it all makes sense when you're around  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (yeah)  
The two of us but no one there (making love is)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (I'm gonna keep you baby)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you
