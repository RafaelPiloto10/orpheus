I stab you right between the eyes  
You awaken from the lies  
I said it ever since the inception  
Where the masters of deception  
I'm a godless heretic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
That's why it's become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Like a storm that devastates  
Religious power instigate  
Take religion to my confession  
There is no filter on my aggression  
With a blister open wide  
To keep the massacre alive  
I got cold devastation  
With my moral imperfection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Religious death, I instigate  
From what the bible demonstrates  
Does it document creation  
Of this hopeless infliction  
Of a godless heretic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
That's why it's become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Open life scars, crushing open wounds  
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you  
You left senseless mentally unfit  
Never fucking heard from you again  
Never fucking heard from again
