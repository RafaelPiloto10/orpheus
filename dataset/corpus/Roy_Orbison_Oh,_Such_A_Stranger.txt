Oh, such a stranger, you don't even know me  
It's just as though we never even met  
Oh, such a stranger, you don't even see me  
Tell me was I that easy to forget?  
Don't you remember, please won't you try?  
Was it that long ago, you brought tears to my eyes?  
Oh, such a stranger, we're not even friends  
Don't you even remember me when?  
Oh, such a stranger, we're not even friends  
Don't you even remember me when?
