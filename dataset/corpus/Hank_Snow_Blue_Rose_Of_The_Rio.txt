Blue rose of the Rio I can see her now  
As she looked that day when I rode away through a golden dawn  
It was there by the Rio that we made our vows  
Then we kissed goodbye what a fool was I fore I traveled on  
I should have known as we kissed such heaven as this could only be  
Paradise's lost if it would tossed away so free  
Must I wish for manana that will never come true  
Blue rose of the Rio my answer is you  
(I should have known)
