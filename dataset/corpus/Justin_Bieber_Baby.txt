Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
You know you love me, you know you care  
Just shout whenever and I'll be there  
You are my love, you are my heart  
And we will never, ever, ever be apart  
  
Are we an item? Girl quit playin'  
We're just friends, what are you sayin'  
Said there's another, look right in my eyes  
My first love, broke my heart for the first time  
  
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby ooh  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
Oh for you, I would have done whatever  
And I just can't believe we ain't together  
And I wanna play it cool  
But I'm losin' you  
I'll buy you anything  
I'll buy you any ring  
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me  
And just shake me, til you wake me from this bad dream  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down  
And I can't believe my first love won't be around  
  
And I'm like baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby ooh  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love  
There was nobody that compared to my baby  
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above  
She had me goin' crazy  
Oh I was starstruck  
She woke me up daily  
Don't need no Starbucks  
She made my heart pound  
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and  
At school on the playground  
But I really wanna see her on the weekend  
She know she got me dazin'  
'Cause she was so amazin'  
And now my heart is breakin'  
But I just keep on sayin'  
  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby ooh  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
Now I'm all gone  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)  
Gone, gone, gone I'm gone gone
