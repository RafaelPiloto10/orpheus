You'll have to be a little more standoffish  
When fellers offer you a buggy ride  
  
I'll give an imitation of a crawfish  
And dig myself a hole where I can hide  
  
I heard how you was kicken' up some capers  
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo.  
I heard some things you couldn't print in papers  
From fellers who been talkin' like they know!  
  
Foot!  
I only did the kind of things I orta, sorta  
To you I was as faithful as can be, for me  
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers-rumors!  
A lot of tempest in a pot o' tea!  
  
The whole don't sound very good to me.  
  
Well, you see  
  
I go and sow my last wild oat  
I cut out all shenanigans  
I save my money, don't gamble or drink  
In the back room down at Flannigans!  
I give up lotsa other things  
A gentleman never mentions  
But before I give up any more  
I wanna know your intentions!  
  
With me, it's all er nuthin'  
Is it all or nuthin' with you?  
It cain't be in between  
It can't be now and then  
No half and half romance will do!  
  
I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type  
All complete with slippers and pipe  
Take me like I am er leave me be!  
If you can't give me all, give me nuthin'  
And nuthin's what you'll git from me  
  
Not even somethin'  
  
Nuthin's what you'll git from me!  
  
It cain't be in between  
  
Nnn-mmm  
  
It cain't be now and then  
  
No half and half romance will do  
  
Would you build me a house  
All painted white  
Cute and clean and purty and bright  
  
Big enough fer two but not fer three!  
  
Suposin' that we should have a third one  
  
He'd better look a lot like me  
  
No spittin' image  
  
He'd better look a lot like me!  
  
With you it's all er nuthin'  
All fer you and nothin' fer me  
But if a wife is wise, she's gotta realize  
That men like you are wild and free  
  
So I ain't gonna fuss, ain't gonna frown  
Have your fun, go out on the town  
Stay up late and don't come home til three!  
And go right off to sleep if you're sleepy  
There's no use waitin' up fer me  
  
Oh, Ado Annie!  
  
No use waitin' up fer me!  
  
Come back and kiss me
