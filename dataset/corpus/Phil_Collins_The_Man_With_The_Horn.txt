They come from miles around just to hear him play  
He's on the same street corner almost every day  
And there's always a crowd wherever he goes  
And when he blows his horn, well everybody knows  
  
I only wanna see him play  
All the girls 'n' boys they wanna see him play  
Nobody else they wanna see him play  
And he brings a tear to the eye  
He'll make you smile of make you cry  
And nobody asks him why  
Cos they just wanna see him play  
  
They come from every way, every night  
He's got a band so out there, it's outta sight  
And the boys in the dancehall are rocking in the aisle  
The girls up front - they wanna see him smile  
  
I only wanna see him play  
All the girls 'n' boys they wanna see him play  
Nobody else they wanna see him play  
And he brings a tear to the eye  
He'll make you smile of make you cry  
Ooh, nobody asks him why  
Cos they just wanna see him play  
  
Yeah, he's the man with the horn  
Ooh they wanna see him play  
Yeah, he's the man with the horn  
Ooh they wanna see him play  
Yeah, he's the man with the horn  
You know they wanna see him, they wanna see him  
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna see him play  
  
(Play it, Don!)  
  
Ah, station to station, coast to coast  
Well you can hear all his records on the radio  
He makes every evening feel like Saturday night  
And if you're happy or sad he'll make the feeling right  
  
I only wanna see him play  
All the girls 'n' boys they wanna see him play  
Nobody else they wanna see him play  
And he brings a tear to the eye  
He'll make you smile of make you cry  
Ooh, nobody asks him why  
Cos they just wanna see him play  
  
Yes, you know they wanna see him, they wanna see him  
Chow, they know they wanna see him, they wanna see him  
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna see him play  
They wanna see him play, play, play, play  
Oh, all the girls and boys wanna see him play  
All the girls and boys wanna see him play  
All the girls and boys...
