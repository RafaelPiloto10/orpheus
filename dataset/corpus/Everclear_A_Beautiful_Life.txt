You seem to make the same mistakes everyday  
Sometimes its hard to open your eyes  
You want to be the only cake on the table  
Yeah, you say you don't like surprises  
You want to find a pretty little place to stay  
You just don't want to live and leave  
  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
I just want to be with you  
  
Oh,  
I really hate how you push me away  
I do not like it when you shut me out  
I say I love you but I really don't know you  
I want to change you but I don't know how  
I want to leave when it gets ugly and cold  
I want to leave but I have no where to go  
  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
Yeah, I just want to be where the sun shines down  
On a beautiful life  
I just want to find a beautiful life  
I want to be where the sun shines down  
I just want to find a beautiful life  
I don't care where we go  
I don't care where we go  
  
You seem to make the same mistakes all the time  
Sometimes it's not too hard to understand why  
You say you hate the things you have done  
Yeah, you have been running with your back to the sun  
You want to find a place where you don't have to hide  
You say you're just happy to be alive  
  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
Yeah, I just want to be where the sun shines down  
Yeah, yeah  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
On a beautiful life  
I just want to find a beautiful life  
I just want to be where the sun shines down  
I just want to find a beautiful life  
I want to be where the sun shines down  
I want to be where the sun shines down  
  
I don't care where we go  
I don't care what we do  
As long as I can be with you  
I just want to be with you
