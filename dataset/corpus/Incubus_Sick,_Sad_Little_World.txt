No your not the first to fall apart  
But always the first one to complain  
You better get careful or you'll compromise  
Everything you are  
  
The world is a drought when out of love  
Please come back to us you're all of the above  
"I'm making a choice to be out of touch  
Leave me be" he said  
He said he said  
"leave me here in my  
Stark raving sick sad little world!"  
  
I've never had unpaid confidants  
Its more than I would care to explain  
But I have an open door policy when it comes to blame  
  
The world is a joke when out of love  
Please come back to us your all of the above  
"I'm making a choice to be out of touch  
Leave me be" he said  
He said he said  
"leave me here in my  
Stark raving sick sad little world!"
