I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
No, I, I know it's hard to remember  
The people we used to be  
It's even harder to picture  
That you're not here next to me  
You say it's too late to make it  
But is it too late to try?  
And in our time that you wasted  
All of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my life  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time when we called it love  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a pay phone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
You turn your back on tomorrow  
'Cause you forgot yesterday  
I gave you my love to borrow  
But you just gave it away  
You can't expect me to be fine  
I don't expect you to care  
I know I've said it before  
But all of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my nights  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time when we called it love  
But even the Sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
And all those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
Now I'm at a payphone  
  
Man, that  
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sittin' round  
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing  
Made it from the botton  
Now when you see me I'm stuning  
And all of my cars start with a push of a button  
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it  
Switched the number to my phone  
So you never could call it  
Don't need my name, on my shirt  
You can tell it I'm ballin'  
  
Swish, what a shame coulda got picked  
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot  
So you talk about who you see at the top  
Or what you could've saw  
But sad to say it's over for her  
Phantom roll up valet open doors  
Wish I'd go away, got what you was looking for  
Now it's me who they want  
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
And all those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
I'm at a payphone!
