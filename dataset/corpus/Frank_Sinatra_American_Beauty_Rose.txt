Daisy is darling, Iris is sweet  
Lily is lovely, Blossom's a treat  
Of all the sweethearts - a guy could meet  
Well I finally chose an American beauty rose  
  
Camelia's tragic, she can't be mine  
Magnolia's magic, it makes Maggie shine  
Laurel will hug you, Orchid's divine  
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose  
  
She's clingier than Ivy, and she's zingier than black-eyed Susan  
And springier than Mabel in June  
I'm daffy as a daffodil, it's laughable the way I thrill  
When roses are in bloom  
  
Pansy is pretty, Willow is tall  
Violet's kisses, tulips (two lips) recall (Violet's kiss is Tulip's recall)  
How can I choose one, I love 'em all  
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose
