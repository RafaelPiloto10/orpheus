Hey, hey, honey, what's on your mind  
Well, you said that sleepin' with a poor band's not your style  
Ain't that just a little unkind  
Hey, Marlon Brando, what would you do in a spot like this  
I don't play as your pawn tonight  
  
Doin' the New York Hustle with a hundred dollar miss  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
There's music, and I can always hear it playin'  
New York Nights and there's music in the streets  
  
A doin' the Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin' that old familiar tune  
And now yakety yak and don't talk back  
When a guy lay me down with my Pontiac  
Tell those high school queens of mine that the  
Prom was for your monkey shine  
  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh, so pretty  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls make you feel so fine  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh, so pretty  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
Music in the streets  
  
Another night, another town  
I'm out on the road and ther's no one around  
And it's rainin', yeah, it's rainin'  
Silence is all around  
It's cold and lonely, oh darlin', if only I could feel it  
Oh, can you feel it  
  
Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin' that old familiar tune  
Hey, Marlon Brando, do you agree it feels so fine  
Doin' the New York Hustle  
These girls are doin' the monkey shine  
  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
There's music, and I can always hear it playin'  
New York Nights and there's music in the streets
