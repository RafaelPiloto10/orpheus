Since the time we met never shall forget  
The magic feeling when I look in your eyes  
Every now and then I see you again  
But the words never come out right  
I've always been painfully shy  
I hide what I feel inside  
Tonight I  
(Never let you get away)  
Open my heart  
(Invite you in to stay)  
I need you  
(More than words can say)  
And I hope you feel the same  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
Hope that there's a chance, baby  
That we can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I wanna love you endlessly  
Many times before I would just ignore  
Love when it came around and knocked on my door  
Keeping to myself, trusting no one else  
I've put my heart out of reach on a shelf  
With you I can't pass up this chance  
For a once in a lifetime romance  
'Cause after all  
(Someone said it very plain)  
When it comes to love  
(No pain, no gain)  
I think I'll  
(Take a chance on you)  
And you know I play to win  
I'm gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
Hope that there's a chance, honey  
That we can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I wanna love you endlessly, yeah  
Oh, I'm looking for one lifetime romance  
(Someone said it very plain)  
I'll think I'll  
(No pain, no gain)  
Take a chance on you  
(Take a chance on you)  
Ooh, 'cause you know I play to win, baby  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
(Gonnna make you mine)  
I'm gonna make you mine  
I believe there's a chance that  
We can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I gonna love you endlessly  
(Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine)  
I'm gonna make you mine  
And I won't take no for answer  
(Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine)  
Oh, you've captured my heart  
I know that we can get together, together, together  
(Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine)  
I'm gonna make you and I'm gonna love you  
And I won't take no for answer
