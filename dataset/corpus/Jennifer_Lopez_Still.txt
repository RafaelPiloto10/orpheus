When I sleep  
I have dreams about the way we used to kiss  
About the way you used to hold me  
And say nothin' would ever harm me  
When we first met  
Oh how you charmed me  
Made me smile when I was down  
Big pimpin' around the town  
You and me  
Whenever they'd see you  
They'd see me  
A lover and a friend to me you were  
How did it end  
How it hurts  
To not have you in my life  
when I won't even be alright  
  
[Bridge]  
You never know what you have  
Till its gone  
Treated you wrong  
For so long  
Now you're gone away  
But the love still is here  
  
[Chorus]  
Still  
I still got love for you  
Still  
After what we been through  
Still  
I gave my heart to you  
And baby you're the only one  
  
There's never men like you  
Still  
That can come close to you  
Still  
Once I said I love you  
I knew you'd be the only one  
  
A good man you were to me  
Always there to care  
Would do anything in this world for me  
Didn't matter, what, when, or where  
You were there  
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start  
When I just wanted to get some attention  
And I'm sorry baby for bitchin  
If I could take back the words  
That I said to make you leave  
I'd be down on bended knees  
That's when you'd take me  
Forgive me  
  
You never know what you have  
Till it's gone  
Treated you wrong  
For so long  
Now you're gone away  
But the love still is here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of the good times we had together (together)  
Do they mean somethin' to you  
Do you ever wish we never split (never)  
Still got love for you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
