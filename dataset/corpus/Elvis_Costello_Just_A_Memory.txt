Layin' about, lyin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said  
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow  
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
Cause the moments that I can't recall  
Are the moments that you treasure  
Better take another measure for measure  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Now you're here, I'm here too  
Could be this easy for me and you  
  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Lyin' about layin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said
