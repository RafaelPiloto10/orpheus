Take me home  
Sailing on with Romany  
To and fro on a icy morning  
Feeling calm to have an old friend 'round  
Feeling warm to see the wind blow down  
  
Take me home  
Where saints and children laughing  
Tell the Dutchman ships are passing  
Feeling safe to reach the harbor sound  
  
Feeling warm to see the wind blow down  
Take me home  
Leave the galley sailors talking  
Leave the bridge and captain's walking  
Feeling naked on the covered ground  
Feeling warm to see the wind blow down  
  
The wind blowed  
Down in the moonless light  
The sea was dark  
The breeze was light  
Everyone's thoughts were their own  
Caught by the ocean thief  
The bow hit on a coral reef  
Romany sank like a stone  
  
chorus  
verse 1
