Long ago a young man sits and plays his waiting game  
But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams  
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon  
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be  
  
Where do those golden rainbows end?  
Why is this song so sad?  
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend  
Loving the love I love  
  
To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said  
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold  
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass  
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass  
  
Where do your golden rainbows end?  
Why is this song I sing so sad?  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
Loving the love I love to love to love to love
