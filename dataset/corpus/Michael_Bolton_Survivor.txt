(You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)  
  
You can't believe that your whole worlds shattered  
You used to have it all under control  
It's like you've lost everything that mattered  
And you're afraid to fall  
You've been though it all too many times  
  
And though I know your pain  
Without it there's no way  
So the say  
Yeah oh  
You're lying in the rain  
Letting it fall across your face  
Just to feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's hear it for the ones  
Who know what it feels like  
To survive a broken heart  
Put one hand up in the sky  
Tonight  
If you know what it feels like  
To survive a broken heart  
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor,
survivor)  
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor,
survivor)  
  
You're searching through all the thought's you've gathered  
And it feels impossible  
To make it through another day  
Where do you turn when your faiths been scattered  
And nothing is logical  
You've been through it all too many times  
  
And you can feel your pain  
But you can't win before you lose  
So they say  
Yeah oh  
You search for who's to blame  
When you let go you find the truth  
Is just to feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A thousand pieces on the ground  
How do you put them back together once again  
And when your world comes crashing down  
That's when you rise and find your way up  
That's when you find out what you're made of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor,
survivor)  
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor,
survivor)
