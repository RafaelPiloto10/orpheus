There is no time to sit around and wait  
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate  
Now is the time, we've got to be strong  
We can't go wrong  
Because the time has come, the time has come  
To be free can't you see  
Don't you know the cheating, the killing, backbiting it cannot help  
'Cause' can't you see them problems, it's everyday  
They've got to solve themselves  
'Cause' now is the time, we gotta be strong  
We can't go wrong  
Because the time has come, the time has come  
To be free can't you see  
There is no time to sit around and wait  
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate  
'Cause now is the time, we've got to be strong  
We can't go wrong  
Because the time has come, the time has come  
To be free can't you see
