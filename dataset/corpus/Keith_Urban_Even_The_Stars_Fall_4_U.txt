I couldn't bring myself to take you home  
I've got you out here all alone  
And even this old drunken mind  
Still right here tonight  
  
Yellow fireflies in the field  
Think I know the way I feel  
At the corner of my eye  
Did you see that?  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
So make a wish and make it fast  
I just want this thing to last  
'Cause heaven knows it's falling hard  
And I'm not the only one  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
I never counted on your touch  
Making me want you so much  
I never dreamed of your sweet lips  
Could make me feel like this  
Nothing like this  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
'Cause you gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you
