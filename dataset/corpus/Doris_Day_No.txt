Stranded at the drive in  
Branded a fool  
What will they say  
Monday at school  
  
Sandy, can't you see I'm a misery  
We made a start now we're apart  
there's nothing left for me  
Love has flown, all alone  
I sit, I wonder, why-y-y Oh why  
You left me, oh Sandy  
Oh Sandy Baby  
Someday, when my high school is done  
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one  
And heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see, please say you'll stay Oh Sandy.  
Oh sandy, you hurt me real bad, call me back, 'coz baby you gotta believe me
when I say, I'm helpless without you  
Love has flown, all alone  
I sit, I wonder, why-y-y, oh why  
You left me, oh sandy  
Oh sandy baby  
Someday, when my high school is done  
Somehow, Someday our two worlds will be one  
Heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see, please say you'll stay oh sandy-y-y-y-y-y-y oh sandy
