Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I'm not driving  
Something hasn't quite  
Taken over but it's trying  
  
Check it, check it  
  
The question now is time  
The hours pass so slowly  
I know we're moving out of line  
But that's the risk you're taking with me  
  
I flicker like an old film - Black white  
I'm losing track of what's real - I know  
My sense of timing's not quite - OK  
Maybe I'll stay tonight - So so  
  
Fadeout, as in lose  
My character is shrapnel  
Broken by the views  
Of men who claim to know all  
(There is to know)  
  
Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I am no-one  
Something hasn't quite  
Stopped me from being someone  
  
Nothing in the mirror - Check it  
No photo by my bedside - Check it  
My self control is missing - Check it  
I'll leave with your permission - Check it
