Just friends, lovers no more  
Just friends but not like before  
  
To think of what we've been  
Not to love again seems like pretending  
This isn't the ending  
  
True friends, drifting apart  
Two friends, but one broken heart  
We loved, we laughed, we cried  
Then suddenly love died  
The story ends and we're just friends  
  
To think of all we've been  
Not to love again seems like pretending  
This can't be the ending  
  
True friends, drifting apart  
Two friends, but one broken heart  
We loved, we laughed, we cried  
Then suddenly love died  
The story ends and we're just friends
