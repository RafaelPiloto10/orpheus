A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Fascinates me  
More than I ever thought it would.  
(A certain softness)  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
A kind of sadness  
In her smile  
Captivates me  
Surer than anything that's sure  
(A kind of sadness)  
Surer than anything before  
  
The kind of sadness in a smile  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
If I could even find the words to tell you  
I wouldn't want to anyway  
'Cause that could only break the spell  
And you know very well  
I couldn't betray her  
  
A touch of wildness  
In her style  
Haunts my memory  
More than I ever thought it would  
(A touch of wildness)  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A touch of wildness in her style  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
(Repeat first verse)
