Time comes down  
You got to take it on yourself  
You got to give up your past  
You got to give up what came last  
World goes round  
You got to leave it all behind  
You got defeated at last  
  
Little boy blue  
With the feelin' in your soul and the gypsy in your eyes  
Little boy blue  
You got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Life goes on  
You got to catch it if you can  
You must believe it will last  
You can't remember what went past  
Tide comes in  
This fog will surely roll away  
It can't leave, it will stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Tide comes in  
This boat will surely row away  
It can't leave if we stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by
