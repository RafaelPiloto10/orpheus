Side by side, I'll be yours forever  
Rain or shine, any kind of weather  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
Let's take what's getting old and make it new  
  
Oh, eye to eye, it's a blinding confrontation  
You and I, we're a deadly combination  
So don't start mixing truth with jealousy  
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
Black and white always go together  
Day and night you're the precious jewel I treasure  
Wanting every part of you is not a crime  
Or could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
All that I love (all that I love)  
Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind
