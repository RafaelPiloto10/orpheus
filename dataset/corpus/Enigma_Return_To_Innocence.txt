Love  
Devotion  
Feeling  
Emotion  
  
Don't be afraid to be weak  
Don't be too proud to be strong  
Just look into your heart my friend  
That will be the return to yourself  
The return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)  
  
If you want, then start to laugh  
If you must, then start to cry  
Be yourself don't hide  
Just believe in destiny.  
  
Don't care what people say  
Just follow your own way  
Don't give up and lose the chance  
To return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)  
  
That's not the beginning of the end  
That's the return to yourself  
The return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)
