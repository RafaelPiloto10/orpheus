God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus  
He came to love, heal, and forgive  
He lived and died to buy my pardon  
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives.  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives.  
  
How sweet to hold a new born baby  
And feel the pride, a joy he gives  
But greater still the calm assurance  
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives.  
  
And then one day I'll cross the river  
I'll fight life's final war with pain  
And then as death gives way to vict'ry  
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives...
