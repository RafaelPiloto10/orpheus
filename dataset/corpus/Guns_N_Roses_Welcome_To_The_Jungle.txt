Welcome to the jungle we've got fun and games  
We got everything you want honey, we know the names  
We are the people that can find whatever you may need  
If you got the money honey we got your disease  
  
[Chorus]  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knnn knne knees, knees  
I want to watch you bleed  
  
Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day  
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price to pay  
And you're a very sexy girl that's very hard to please  
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my serpentine  
Ooh, I want to hear you scream  
  
Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day  
Ya learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play  
If you hunger for what you see you'll take it eventually  
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you're high you never ever want to come down  
So down, so down, so down, yeah  
  
You know where you are?  
You're down in the jungle baby, you're gonna dieee  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my serpentine  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to you  
Its gonna bring you down, ha!!
