[Chorus]  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home (oh won't you please take me home)  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home (oh won't you please take me home)  
  
Just a urchin livin' under the street  
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat  
I'm your charity case so buy me something to eat  
I'll pay you at another time  
Take it to the end of the line  
  
Rags to riches or so they say  
Ya gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame  
You know it's all a gamble when it's just a game  
Ya treat it like a capital crime  
Everybody's doin' the time  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
  
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber  
Why I'm here I can't quite remember  
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe  
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see  
Tell me who you're gonna believe  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
  
Captain America's been torn apart  
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart  
He said "turn me around and take me back to the start"  
I must be losing my mind "are you blind?"  
I've seen it all a million times  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go  
Oh won't you please take me home  
I wanna see how good it can be  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down, lead me 'round  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
I wanna see, what a woman can be  
I want to take you home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
I wanna go, I wanna know  
Oh won't you please take me home
