They're working while I'm missing you those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine  
They'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind  
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time  
They let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll let me sleep again those healing hands of time  
So already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
