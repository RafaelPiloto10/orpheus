Chorus  
As the world goes round, round, round,  
Let the beat go down down down  
Can we stay up all night,  
Cuz we can sleep all day,  
Everybody can come out to play,  
Lemme hear ya say... Yeah yeah yeah...  
  
How did we get here, it feels like m fallin' off the ground,  
Love is the only place, now m getting scared of looking down,  
Lets go,, aah aah.  
I got so hot that I don't feel anything baby,  
Aah aah,  
And get this spot, let me get you by my side,  
Aah aah  
It's about to get crazy I wanna get crazy with me,  
Hold on, time...
