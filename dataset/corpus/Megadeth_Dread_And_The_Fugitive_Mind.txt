Let me introduce myself I'm a social disease  
I've come for your wealth leave you on your knees  
No time for feeling sorry, I got here on my own  
I won't ask for mercy, I choose to walk alone  
  
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught?  
What if there is no judgment?  
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked  
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind  
  
You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you  
Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air  
Come a long way to find what you really left behind  
You don't know when the end is but it's coming fast  
  
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught?  
What if there is no judgment?  
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked  
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind
