[Verse 1]  
Been around the world, the wonders to view  
Been around the world, looking for someone like you  
Pyramids try, Babylon too  
But the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue  
  
[Chorus]  
So I never say die, aim never untrue  
I'm never so high as when I'm with you  
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through  
My army of one is gonna fight for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Been around the world, universe too  
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do  
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon  
And be standing here beside you  
Right when the storm comes through  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I never say die, aim never untrue  
I'm never so high as when I'm with you  
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through  
My army of one is gonna fight for you  
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause you reign  
All cause you reign  
All cause you reign  
My army of one is gonna call it through  
  
[Outro]  
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one  
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one  
It's my only weapon, army of one  
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
