Hello don't you know me  
I'm the dirt beneath your feet  
The most important fool you forgot to see  
I've seen how you give it  
Now I want you to receive  
I know that you  
Would do the same for me  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way  
  
For all of your kisses turned  
To spit in my face  
For all that reminds me  
Which is my place  
For all of the times when  
You made me disappear  
This time I'm sure you will  
Know that I'm here  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way  
  
My place was beneath you  
But now I'm above  
And now I send you a message  
Of love  
A simple remind of what  
You won't see  
A future so holy without me  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way
