[Verse:]  
Seems like everythin' that's good in life you gotta wait for  
My can't poke lumber dad said on a lake in Tennessee  
And it's like sittin' there and learnin' just to watch  
The morning sunrise, all I know is what it does to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
  
[Verse 2:]  
That old jam-box playin' in the background takes me somewhere  
Back to some ol' late night country highway radio  
I've got all my friends hangin' out, sittin' right here with me  
I get this old feeling I just know...  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Would you look at this night that we've been given?  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
Would you look at this night that we've been given?  
It makes life worth livin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
Turn it up, let's go! Pretty girl dancing backroom  
By the seashore, dirt track, turn to 4(!?)  
Pedal to the metal, gonna show ya what we're here for  
6 strings, good songs, ol' wooden bowl with a skull and a crossbow  
Full moon, that's right! Green grass, good laughs  
Just waitin' on high time and beer can chicken  
Just look at this life that we've been given
