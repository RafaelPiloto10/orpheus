I am loved, I am loved by the one I love in every way  
I am loved, absolutely loved  
What a wonderful thing to be able to say  
  
I'm adored, I'm adored by the one  
who first led my heart astray  
I'm adored, absolutely adored  
What a wonderful thing to be able to say  
  
So ring out the bells, and let the trumpets blow  
And beat on the drums, for now I know, I know  
I am loved, I am loved  
What a wonderful thing, what a glorious thing  
What a beautiful thing, to be able to say  
  
So ring out the bells, and let the trumpets blow  
And beat on the drums, for now I know, I know  
I am loved, I am loved  
What a wonderful thing, what a glorious thing  
What a beautiful thing, what a marvelous thing  
What if happy to sing, what a crazy thing  
What a lovely thing, what a precious thing  
To be able to say
