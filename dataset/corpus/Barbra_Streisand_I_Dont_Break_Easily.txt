I took my chances,  
Thinking something might be saved.  
Growing tired of broken promises  
And dreams you never made.  
  
And I wanted to be more than just a friend,  
Not knowing I would hurt, so, in the end.  
So I swore I'd never call you home again.  
  
Took time to see through all the glitter  
That you made.  
I was blinded by your fire light  
And swept myself away.  
  
And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see  
You had taken all the very best of me.  
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me.  
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.  
  
You know I thought I knew the answers,  
'Cause I've been hurt before,  
And one more time around won't break me.  
You will never see that side of me,  
No, no, no, no,  
I don't break easily.  
  
I told my service to pick up all my calls,  
And I've taken down our photographs  
That lined our bedroom walls.  
And the outside door no longer has your name.  
All your clothes are gone.  
  
My welcome mat's been changed,  
But the key's still there,  
And I've left the door unchained.  
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.  
  
Oh, I thought I knew all the answers,  
I've been hurt before,  
And just one more time around  
Won't break me down.  
  
You will never see that side of me,  
No, no, no,  
I don't break easily.  
No, no, I won't break easily
