Go home, pretender  
I think this is the end here  
It's been a long time decidin'  
But I think I've found the right end.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.  
  
Hopes crushed and battered  
But you laugh as if it didn't matter  
This joke is gonna turn blue  
And I won't be there to hold you.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.  
  
Go home, debater  
It was soon and now it's later  
And that's only a piece of paper  
So don't you stand there a-laughin' and a-wavin' it.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.
