My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
Headed out into uncharted waters  
What you feel is your only guide  
And each step that you take brings you closer  
Just trust what you feel inside  
Cause something's telling you to keep on going  
Telling you that your aim is true  
Could be the voice of reason, or just blind devotion  
Whatever it is, it's calling out to you, singing  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
Mixed messages shoot through a wire  
Tender turmoil in your voice  
Change is spreading through you like a fire  
Bridges are burning, you made your choice  
And as you're searching for peace in your world  
You may find yourself spinning around, and around, and around  
While the pain you've endured  
Only serves to make you surer  
Of the strength you have found, and then  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
You may not be looking for love, but love may find you  
You may choose to close your eyes and run  
You may leave love far behind you  
In your eyes I can see the future  
In your heart I can always trust  
In your mind I will live on forever  
In your arms I will turn to dust  
These are feelings like I have never known  
The song of my very soul  
I can no longer silently sing it  
I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock
