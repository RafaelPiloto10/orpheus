Whooo hoo  
Cindy and Scott are newley-weds  
Whoop-Ee-Doo  
  
He loves her, but she loves this guy,(right over here)  
And he loves somebody else -  
You just can't win.  
And so it goes until the day you die.  
This thing they call love,  
Its gonna make you cryyy I hate you.  
  
I've had the blues, the reds and the pinks.  
One thing's for suurre...  
  
Love stinks

Love stinks!  
Love stinks! Yeah yeah...  
Love Stinks  
Love stinks! Yeah yeah...
