(Alien jargon)  
  
Get up y'all, yeah.  
  
Stand Up (5x)  
  
I woke up to the angels,  
They singing in my head.  
You look so good naked next to me,  
The angel in my bed.  
  
Stand Up (4x)  
  
Oh you feel like a drug,  
That's cooking in my veins.  
Till I'm so out of my mind,  
And shoots you up again.  
  
Stand Up (4x)  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Save my soul... Stand Up  
  
Smell like smoky fire  
Is burning in us all.  
You drop me in the water  
Lift me up, save my soul.  
  
Stand Up (8x)  
  
(Sax Solo)  
  
Save my soul... Stand Up  
  
Stand Up (12x) (fade out)
