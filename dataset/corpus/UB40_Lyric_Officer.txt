Why do you have to force yourself with power and control  
Why do you have to live your life playing up a role  
Intimidating people with your wall of sight and sound  
You and your kind destroy our underground  
  
All the happiness you destroy  
All the brutal tactics that you always employ  
All the fucking bullshit when will it ever stop  
The comparison is obvious, you're a fucking cop  
Officer, you act like an animal, you're out of control  
  
Officer, what the hell is wrong with you  
Wear a tie if you want to wear a uniform  
Join the army if you want to conform  
Tough guy asshole do what you can  
Whatever you destroy we'll create it again
