Sherman Tanks and Tommy Guns,  
Telegrams and Hot Cross Buns,  
See the Gerries on the run,  
Battleships well here I come,  
Commando raid in bed tonight,  
Under the covers with torch light.  
(chorus)  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts  
  
Kamicaze crashes plane,  
Shits himself but all in vain,  
Fix the mine under the tray,  
And get away in time again,  
The cap-I-tan is on the bridge,  
Pulls the pin from his sandwich.  
  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts.  
  
Prison camps and sorry sarge,  
Biting harder than his bark,  
Got a bullet in his arm,  
Pulled it out and took em' on,  
Commando raid in bed tonight,  
Under the cover with torch light.  
  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts,  
More blood and guts,  
More blood and guts,  
More blood and guts.
