Ne-Yo:  
OK! Bad day got you seeing red  
Wanted to feel the sun on your back  
But it rained on your head instead  
But on the bright side despite this hassle  
Wet sand makes for a better sand castle  
Inhale exhale just take a breath  
And know that things don't always happen like they should  
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyone's watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you  
But when it's all said and done  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
  
Cher Lloyd:  
Woke up from the wrong side of the bed  
Gotta get the work done  
And then some got a busy day ahead  
But look on the bright side  
Work hard play harder  
Tomorrow's full of laughter  
Inhale exhale just take a breath  
And know that things don't always happen like they should  
Noooo  
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyones watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you  
But when it's all said and done  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
  
Ne-Yo:  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah Yeah  
Hey  
There'll be bumps in the road  
Things will go out of control  
But you can't let it get you down  
When the right just goes wrong  
Just stop and keep pushing on  
It's all good  
Play it here and now  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyones watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you  
But when it's all said and done  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good
