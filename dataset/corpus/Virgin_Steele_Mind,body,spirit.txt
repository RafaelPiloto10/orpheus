On the bridge of hades, searching for a sign  
On the brink of knowledge, there's no time  
Shadow of the horseman who is sworn to rise  
Seven are now waiting in the skies warring angels forage  
Scavengers of pain I am born to power  
Courage is my name  
  
Rise on the wings of truth  
To the sun we know that forever lives inside  
Mind, body, spirit  
All are one  
  
Rising like a tower, fortune's torch revives  
Slicing every rule that will divide  
Who will hold the red queen when misfortune cries  
Seven bands are waiting in the sky  
Murder and fire and pain is the  
Sign swollen with power your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
  
Rise on the wings of doom to the sun  
We know that forever lives inside  
Mind, body, spirit, all are one  
Mind, body, spirit, all are one  
  
Prizing only valor numen steal the  
Light on the brink of knowledge  
Burning bright shadow of the  
Horseman who is sworn to rise  
Sin and death are waiting in the  
Skies murder and fire and pain is the  
Sign swollen with power your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
  
Rise on the wings of death, to the sun  
We know that forever lives inside  
  
I see my vision, I see the line  
Circling onward, looking for nine  
I know the answer is not to be found  
Searching in darkness with eyes of the blind  
And in the morning,  
Two will remain  
To carry us onward, to guard the flame  
That we know  
There'll be time, for all, for all  
We don't need you, we're fine on our own  
We don't want you, leave us alone  
Fortune is fire as numen we  
Shine invoking the power, your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know the mind is a tower  
The body sublime the soul is the power, your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
Leave us alone
