Listen  
I was born on the other side  
Just always looking to you  
I made it over the great divide  
Now I'm coming for you  
  
Your forces lined up in battle  
Your soldiers and your machines  
The sun been blacked out by shadows  
The darkest hour now you've ever seen  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
I rose up on the doctor's slab  
Like Lazarus from the pit  
And everyone wants to take a stab  
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit  
  
I've been held up on money  
I've been beaten out of spite  
You want a piece of me honey?  
Lose or win  
  
You know you've been in a fight  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell  
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the  
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too  
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the  
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,  
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it  
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.  
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than  
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So  
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew  
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings  
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and  
Tear him down.  
  
Now there ain't much difference  
Between a bridge and a wall  
Without me right in the middle baby  
You'll be nothing at all  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
Try and tear me down
