The King is dead but the Queen is alive,  
Off with his head I am done with his lies,  
A fair win I have fought for my life,  
A clean slate after all this time,  
A revolution and now I am in charge,  
My evolution is to shoot for the stars,  
His first mistake he underestimates,  
He didn't bother to appreciate.  
  
Chorus:  
Rah rah rah,  
Sis boom fuckin' blah  
There's a party in your honour, but you won't be there whatever, so,  
Three cheers for the one that got away,  
You were just blah blah blah,  
I was oh my god,  
And unlike your anatomy,  
I'm glad I had it in me,  
Now The King,  
The King,  
The King,  
The King is dead,  
But The Queen is alive (repeat)  
  
Second verse:  
I guess the village didn't raise you right,  
Don't think nobodies gonna mourn you tonight,  
No more licks to wet your appetite,  
You make me sick I didn't wanna fight,  
I thought we ruled the heavens in the earth,  
I really thought I was the only girl,  
Your secrets have all been revealed to me,  
You've been dethroned there goes your legacy  
  
Chorus  
Rah rah rah,  
Sis boom fuckin' blah  
There's a party in your honour, but you won't be there whatever, so,  
Three cheers for the one that got away,  
You were just blah blah blah,  
I was oh my god,  
And unlike your anatomy,  
I'm glad I had it in me,  
Now The King,  
The King,  
The King,  
The King is dead,  
But The Queen is alive (repeat)  
  
Third verse:  
There are consequences in this life,  
A punishment that fits the crime,  
Your last words, I heard I'm sorry,  
Now look at me in all my glory,  
  
The King is dead but the queen is alive,  
I wear your crown and I look quite nice,  
I almost let you get the best of me  
But no ones ever gonna get the queen. (Scream),

Chorus  
Rah rah rah,  
Sis boom fuckin' blah  
There's a party in your honour, but you won't be there whatever, so,  
Three cheers for the one that got away,  
You were just blah blah blah,  
I was oh my god,  
And unlike your anatomy,  
I'm glad I had it in me,  
Now The King,  
The King,  
The King,  
The King is dead,  
But The Queen is alive  
  
(Repeat)
