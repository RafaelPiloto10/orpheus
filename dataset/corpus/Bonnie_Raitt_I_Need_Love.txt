I need love  
And I search it everyplace I go  
And lately I been in a zone  
It's got a will of its own  
But right now I'm here to discuss  
Just what you think about us  
I need love, I need love  
  
And I'm checkin everything I see  
You know at times I want to take on three  
That's just the way I could be  
I let you know about that  
Just so you know where I'm at  
I need love, I need love  
  
It's always been this way and ain't' nothin'  
Gonna change it  
And ain't nothing you can try  
I need love, I need love  
And I'm takin' every chance I man  
And baby you could make my day  
  
There's just one thing I should say  
Now that's it's all said and done  
You know I do need to run  
I need love, I need love
