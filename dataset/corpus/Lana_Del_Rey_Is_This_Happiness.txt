I've been to Hollywood hills taking violet  
Pills writing all of my songs about with cheap friends  
You're a hard man to loving on  
A hard woman to keep track of  
You like to rage don't do that  
You want your way You make me so mad  
Got your gun I've gon' my day  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]  
  
I've been in Hollywood Hills scorching valley  
Pills you've been trying to write a novel  
'Bout your cheap fails  
You think you want the race  
But soon I think you're fucking crazy as day is long  
Man to man heart to heart  
I love you but you drive me so far  
Wish you well I'm that star  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]  
  
Which day is on  
Which day is on  
Betrayal  
Betrayal  
One gun on, don't take boy  
Hands short if  
Your rainbow  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]
