Did you think I'd take it sitting down  
And let you walk all over me  
Thought you knew me much better than that  
I keep much better company  
  
With your lawyers and your two timing friends  
I guess you know who I mean  
Your detectives and your private eyes  
Could never win me back again  
  
Just where did it get ya  
What satisfaction was had  
You kicked the shit right in my face  
Is that all the thanks I get  
  
You said we made such a pretty pair  
Living in harmony  
I'm sorry honey but I disagree  
It seemed more like a comedy  
  
Just look how you lied girl  
That Judas right by your side  
He hung you up so you cut me right down  
Is that all the thanks I get  
  
Guess I'll find me a brand new girl  
That won't take too very long  
There's so many floatin' 'round this town  
Waitin' by the telephone  
And if you want me I'll be in the bar  
Back into my usual ways  
Or on the corner with the rest of the boys  
You and I were just a breath away  
It was great while it lasted  
But oh Lord it turned nasty  
You didn't give me one chance to explain  
Well is that all the thanks I get  
  
Is that the thanks I get  
Is that the thanks I get  
Is that the thanks I get for loving you  
Is that the thanks I get  
Is that the thanks I get  
Is that the thanks I get for loving you
