Cold in this room now  
'Cause you left me  
Here by myself  
Used to make love here  
Now this place feels  
Like a prison cell  
So many questions  
That we won't answered  
Not today  
(Not today)  
You scream at me  
I scream at you  
And we communicate  
This way  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Please don't say it's over)  
  
I want to touch you  
Your body heat to me  
Is Vegas sun  
But I won't give in  
Because if I do  
That means you've won  
Pride is a leash  
I don't know  
What I'm wearing it for  
Why do I do?  
This is a game in which  
Both of us are keeping score  
Still, we both lose  
We're fools  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Said please don't say it's over)  
(2x)  
  
Don't say it's over  
Don't say it's over  
Please don't' say it's over  
(Hey, don't say it's over)  
Don't say it's over  
Don't say it's over  
Please don't' say it's over  
(Baby, please  
Don't you say it's over  
Baby please  
Don't say it)  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Please don't say it's over)  
(X2)
