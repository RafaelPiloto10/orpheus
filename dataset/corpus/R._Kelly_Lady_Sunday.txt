La da da da da, la da  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
Where there's no sun, there is that girl  
She is the one, that spins my world  
When I am down, she makes it better  
When there are clouds, she change the weather  
Not wishing well, oh my peace and my glory  
As a fairytale, then she is my story  
When I feel drained, her love is like a fountain  
And when I'm weak, she can move mountains  
  
I never felt a love, no, this way  
I never felt a kiss no, this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
Oh I am her crown and he is my sky  
If life is a road, then she is my ride  
When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling  
When I am sick she brings me healing  
Whenever I call, she is right there  
And when I fall, she says a prayer  
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it  
Introducing Missus Music  
  
I never felt a love, no, this way  
I never felt a kiss no, this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
La da da da, Miss Got-Ge, Miss Righteous, Miss Hallelujah  
Take my hand and be my Missus Future  
'Cause your loving makes the groove much better  
As long as we got music, as we got music  
As long as we got music, we'll dance forever  
  
I never felt a love, no no no no, this way  
I never felt a kiss no, this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
I never felt a love this way, no  
I never felt a kiss no, this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
I never felt a love this way, no  
I never felt a kiss no, this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
I'm so glad, yeah
