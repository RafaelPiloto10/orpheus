Somebody's life  
  
He loves her  
But he sometimes thinks she's crazy  
Laughing  
The next minute mad  
And saying  
'I think you're wasting my time'  
Crying  
Then changing her mind  
  
She's screaming and shouting  
And everything's blinding  
She's laughing out loud  
And busy 'cause she's minding  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody's life  
  
She suffers  
From such violent mood swings  
He says  
They disagree  
He loves her  
And life is never boring  
Some say  
It's just being free  
  
She's screaming and shouting  
And everything's blinding  
She's laughing out loud  
And busy 'cause she's minding  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody's life
