If he walks by and the women get engrosed  
If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast  
He's got a lot of what they call the most  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze  
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it  
  
If he mesmerizes each and every one  
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done  
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twenty one  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if I got to go down to him on bended knees  
It's because I'm hoping, obviously  
That some day his answer will be  
The boy can't help it  
He's in love with me.
