One  
Two  
One-two-two  
  
Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru  
Mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai2  
  
Silhouettes and shadows  
Watch the revolution  
No more free steps to heaven  
It's no game  
  
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare  
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai  
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka  
Hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru  
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii  
  
I am bored from the event  
I really don't understand the situation  
And it's no game  
  
Documentaries on refugees  
Couples 'gainst the target  
You throw a rock against the road  
And it breaks into pieces  
Draw the blinds on yesterday,  
And it's all so much scarier  
Put a bullet in my brain,  
And it makes all the papers to  
  
Nammin no kiroku eiga  
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi  
Michi ni ishi o nage reba  
Kona gona ni kudake  
Kino ni huta o sureba  
Kyohu wa masu  
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba  
Shinbun wa kaki tateru  
  
So where's the moral  
When people have their fingers broken2  
To be insulted by these fascists  
It's so degrading  
And it's no game  
  
Shut up! Shut up!
