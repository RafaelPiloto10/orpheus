I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Said I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
Well I made my first kill  
With the old town girl  
  
She was the apple of her daddy's eye  
Well that woman looked up at me  
And I said honey we'll be  
Together 'till the day I die  
  
But I lied  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
There seems to be no end  
  
Of women who are lookin' for a man  
My services don't come cheap  
But I help out when I can  
Tell them lies that they want to hear  
  
And I really lead em on  
Spend all of their money  
And I'm long, gone  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
  
I've got tastes for fast cars  
I don't want to settle down  
The good life sure come s easily  
With all the mugs around  
  
The women they just come to me  
I don't have to look around  
I move into their homes with them  
Then I move on  
  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad,bad, bad, bad, bad,bad,bad, bad, boy  
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm such a, such a bad, bad boy  
  
I'm gonna rip you off  
Just take control of your mind  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm gonna rip you off  
Just take control of the time  
  
I'm a bad, bad,bad,bad,bad  
You know I'm a bad boy  
I'm so bad...
