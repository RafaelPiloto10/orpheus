There's a corner of your heart for me  
There's a corner of your heart just for me  
I will pack my bags just to stay in the corner of your heart  
Just to stay in the corner of your heart  
  
There is room beneath your bed for me  
There is room beneath your bed just for me  
I will leave this town just to sleep underneath your bed  
Just to sleep underneath your bed  
  
There's one minute of your day  
There's one minute of your day  
I will leave this man just to occupy one minute of your day  
Just to occupy one minute of your day  
  
Just to sleep underneath your bed  
  
Just to stay in the corner of you heart
