I want to vanish  
This is my fondest wish  
To go where I cannot be captured  
Laid on a decorated dish  
Even in splendor this curious fate  
Is more than I care to surrender  
Now it's too late  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
If you should stumble upon my last remark  
I'm crying in the wilderness  
I'm trying my best to make it dark  
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most  
I'm certain as a lost dog  
Pondering a sign post  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
I want to vanish  
This is my last request  
I've given you the awful truth  
Now give me my rest
