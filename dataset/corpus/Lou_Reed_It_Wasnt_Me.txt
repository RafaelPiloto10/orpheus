It wasn't me who shamed you, it's not fair to say that  
You wanted to work I gave you a chance at that  
It wasn't me who hurt you, that's more credit than I'm worth  
Don't threaten me with the things you'll do to you  
  
It wasn't me who shamed you, it wasn't me who brought you down  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
It wasn't me who hurt you, I showed you possibilities  
The problems you had were there before you met me  
  
I didn't say this had to be  
You can't blame these things on me  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
I know she's dead, it wasn't me  
  
It wasn't me who changed you, you did it to yourself  
I'm not an excuse for the hole that you dropped in  
I'm not simple minded but I'm no father to you at all  
Death exists but you do things to yourself  
  
I never said give up control  
I never said stick a needle in your arm and die  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
I know he's dead but it wasn't me  
  
It wasn't me who shamed you, who covered you with mud  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
You act as if I could've told you or stopped you like some god  
But people never listen and you know that that's a fact  
  
I never said slit your wrists and die  
I never said throw your life away  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
You're killing yourself - you can't blame me
