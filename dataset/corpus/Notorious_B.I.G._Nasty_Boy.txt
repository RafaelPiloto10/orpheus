This goes out to my Brooklyn crew  
Representin' on the freaky freaky  
Fuck em all day fuck em all night  
We don't love these hoes  
  
Uh, I go, on and on and on and  
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'  
Easy, call em on the phone and  
Platinum Chanel cologne and  
I stay, dressed, to impress  
Spark these bitches interest  
Sex is all I expect  
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know  
They know, quarter past fo'  
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'  
Except how I'm gettin' home, tomorrow  
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O., uh  
Back of my mind I hope she swallow (uh-huh)  
Man She split a drink on my cream Wallows  
Reach the gate, hungry just ate  
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight  
This must mean she ain't tryin' to wait  
Conversate, sex on the first date I state  
"You know what you do to me"  
She starts off, "well I don't usually"  
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt  
Step out, show me what you all about  
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse  
Pull your G-string down South, aow!  
Threw that back out, in the parking lot  
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top  
And I don't stop, until I squirt  
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I remember we, went to Tennessee  
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone  
Bitch named Symone  
Screamin', she feenin', for the semen  
Me bein, the man that I am  
Took it to her condo, pronto  
Half Indian, I called her Tonto  
Roll the chron'chron' in the dark pronto  
Few puffs, eyes got low  
And off to the bedroom we go (mm)  
Sex is drama, head to trauma  
Rip pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow  
Satisfyin' all my needs twice  
With the whipped cream, handcuffs and ice  
The bitch is nice, word is bond  
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what, what?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ladies, my Mercedes  
Hold fo' in the back, two if your fat  
Keep a gat, cause cats, try to test me  
They just fans like DeNiro, Wesley  
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin on  
Cartier jeans look like they painted on  
Ask thee, leave it up to me  
Lay her on back ever so gently  
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up  
Cristal just throw up, bitch grow up  
Hold up, there's DeGenero  
Dripped out, iceberg apparel  
Intro goes without speaking  
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin  
All weekend, so, roll in  
Ain't it good that my Lex keeps foldin? Uhh  
  
[Chorus]
