I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore  
Leave all your lovers weeping on the faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
On a slow boat to China, all to myself alone
