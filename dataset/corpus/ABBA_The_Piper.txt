They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon
