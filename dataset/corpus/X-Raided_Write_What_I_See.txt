First Verse:  
I gather myself and try to write nicely, but I ain't feelin' that way  
I'd rather write raps that incite fights, riots, and melees  
And they say, "All X-Raided rhyme about is peelin' caps  
Prison crap, fuckin' bitches, gettin' high, and killin' cats"  
But I'm insistin' that I'm spittin' facts  
And y'all niggas is spittin' lies to feel alive  
While I'm livin' in prison  
Couldn't feel that I'm committin' convictions  
What the Hell am I supposed to write?  
How could I compose nice?  
When I'm sittin' in this cell at night like  
And steadily socializin' with  
Every soldier, sodomist, murderer, rapist  
Burgler, racist,  
And drug dealers and thug niggas caught up with three strike cases  
Man I'm faced with bein' in a cage with niggas that love hatred  
That embraced it, and can taste it  
And ain't, feelin' no disgrace  
Would be willin' to pull your heart out and replace it with a cold one  
More should, show love, for the young ones to the old ones  
And where they come from is irrelavent  
But they're gettin' here so face it  
Gotta come up in, if you think you wouldn't be up in, chill  
Revelation, I ain't got no patience for this fakin'  
Hate me and then you can reflect reports straight crip  
Blue and gray bitch  
y'all niggas sport pink and turquoise  
I'm laced with gunpowder from up out of a .44 caliber ???  
Say sin, see my face sin  
Sick to see cuts and disgrace men  
To replace men, but they gotta...  
Chorus:  
Agree with me  
I just write what I see  
Might not believe in me  
I just write what I see  
I might not like what I see  
But whether it's wrong or right  
It ain't a song, it's my life  
I just write what I see  
(2x)
