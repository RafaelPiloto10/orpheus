[Verse:]  
I wanna clap a little louder than before  
I wanna sing a little louder than before, Oh  
I wanna jump higher than before  
I wanna shout a little louder before, Oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Freedom  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I wanna clap a little louder than before  
I wanna sing a little louder than before, Oh  
I wanna jump higher than before  
I gotta scream a little louder than before, Oh  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I wanna lift my hands higher than before  
I wanna love you more than before, Oh  
I wanna worship deeper than before  
I wanna shout a little louder than before, Oh  
  
[Bridge:]  
No more shackles, no more chains  
No more bondage, I am free  
Yeah  
  
[Bridge 2]  
Hallelujah  
  
[Tag]  
I am free to run, I am free
