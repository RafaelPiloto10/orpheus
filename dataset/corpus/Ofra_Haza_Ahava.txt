Day after day, night after night  
Nothing in love is black or white  
Deep down inside, trying to touch  
Wanting to say, "I love you so much"  
  
Wish for a star, sparkling light  
Don't run away, just hold me tight  
Deep down inside, trying to touch  
Wanting to say, "I love you so much"  
  
Ahava, tomorrow we will find  
Ahava, a way into the light  
Ahava, you and I  
Ahava  
  
Yo vo cha yom, le cha ve li  
Ya vo cha yom, koo lo she li  
Bli mil ha ma, bli ema  
Rak ahava, le ne sha ma  
  
Ahava, tomorrow we will find  
Ahava, destiny is calling  
Ahava, you and I  
Ahava  
  
Don't run and hide, don't hold me tight  
I'm going there to see the light  
I wish to know the magic star  
I wish to know the ?  
  
Ahava, tomorrow we will find  
Ahava, a way into the light  
Ahava, you and I  
Ahava
