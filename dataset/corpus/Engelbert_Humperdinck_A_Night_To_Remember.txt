This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams  
In warm reds and greens  
And a star that keeps shining above  
Christmas Eve  
  
Children, Santa, mistletoe and moonlight.  
A feeling of joy everywhere  
And the song in the night  
Being sung clear and bright  
Is a moment for lovers to share  
  
This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams  
In warm reds and greens  
And a star that keeps shining above  
Christmas Eve  
  
Laughter, holly, snowflakes and sleigh bells  
Dreamers who travel the skies  
As we sail on the glow  
Of a fire burning glow  
There's a lifetime of love in your eyes  
  
This is a night to remember  
A sweet celebration of love  
It's a holiday of dreams  
In warm reds and greens  
And a star that keeps shining above  
Christmas Eve  
  
This is a night to remember, Christmas Eve  
This is a night to remember, Christmas Eve
