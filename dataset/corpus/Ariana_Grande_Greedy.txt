[Intro]  
Greedy  
You know that I'm greedy for love  
  
[Verse 1]  
Boy, you give me feelings, never felt before  
I'm making it obvious by knocking at your door  
I know that I'm coming tonight  
You know I'm coming tonight  
Don't want to deny it anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Been in this state of mind  
Been in this state of mind  
Been in this state of mind, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, you got lucky cause you're rocking with the best  
And I'm greedy  
Cause I'm so greedy  
Cause I'm so  
I ain't talking money, I'm just physically obsessed  
And I'm greedy  
Cause I'm so greedy  
Cause I'm so greedy, ooh  
You know that I'm greedy for love  
You know that I'm greedy for love  
Cause I'm so greedy, ooh

Cause I'm so  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need a phone call  
Got nothing to say  
I'ma tell you when it's over  
Got no games to play  
You know that I'm coming tonight  
I know I'm coming tonight  
I just need to get this out the way, oh baby!
