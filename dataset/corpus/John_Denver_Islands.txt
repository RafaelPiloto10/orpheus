Islands call out to me  
Like the highlands that I always see  
In my dreams of home  
I am never alone when I am there  
  
Islands like so many dreams  
Are like canyons but off the main stream  
And there's no one there  
The dreamer is always alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And the mighty blue ocean  
Keeps rolling on every shore  
Like the spirit that binds us together  
We are so much more than islands  
  
Islands belong to the sea  
Like the dark sands of my memory  
When the morning comes  
They are stepping stones to the sun  
  
[Chorus]
