You're marvelous and You're glorious  
Your love has made me victorious  
You took away the fear in us  
Now we praise You cause You can deliver us  
  
There ain't no stoppin' us (naw)  
Devil there ain't no blockin' us (naw)  
Come on and clap your hands with us  
Like this, like that  
  
He reigns (4x)  
  
He reigns  
He reigns  
He reigns  
Forever and ever
