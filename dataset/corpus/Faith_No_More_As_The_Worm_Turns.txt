One day you're thinking that maybe you're feeling better  
And you're probably an OK person, if only you had a job...  
Through the hollow tombs can see them  
Through their mouths I can hear them praying for pain  
But it's only a game  
  
Listen, man, I know  
That things are really rough  
And everybody gets you  
And life is really tough  
But I know that deep down inside  
There's a feeling that rides  
All the way to the end  
  
Thursday you sit in your room with the lights turned out  
And you don't answer the door  
Friday morning looks sunny and bright  
Like it's going to be a good day  
And it would be if only you had a job  
  
Time is on your side, you're young  
Don't waste your time today
