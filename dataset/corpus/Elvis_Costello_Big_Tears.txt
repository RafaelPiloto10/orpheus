Everyone is busy with the regular routine  
The sniper just takes his aim  
Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed  
Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze  
You go to a movie, you go to a show  
You think that you're living, you don't really know  
  
Big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
Oh, you talk about the new boss automatic clause  
But of course they make it all up for you  
Always fascinated by the weird edge of town  
Come home disappointed every time they put you down  
Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise  
  
I suppose big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
All the buttons of my overcoat  
They have fallen off one by one  
You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink  
You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think  
Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows  
  
Don't you know big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
Tell me, me or yous been taken in  
Tell me, tell me, tell me
