Story of a man,  
Who decided not to breathe.  
Turned red, purple, then blue.  
Colorful indeed.  
No matter how his friends begged,  
Well, he would not concede,  
And now he's dead.  
You see, cause everybody knows,  
You got to breathe.  
  
But, oh God,  
Under the weight of life,  
Things seem brighter on the other side...  
Lighter on the other side...  
  
Another one: See this monkey sitting on a tree,  
One day, decided to climb down,  
And run off to the city.  
Look at him now, Tired and drunk  
And living on the street.  
As good as dead.  
You see, a monkey should know,  
Stay up your tree.  
  
But, oh God,  
Under the weight of life,  
Things seem brighter on the other side.  
Oh, God,  
But under the weight of life,  
Things seem much brighter on the other side.  
  
No way, no way, no way.... Out... Of here...  
  
Another one: A big eyed fish,  
Yeah, swimming in the sea,  
Oh, how he dreamed.  
He wants to be a bird,  
Swooping, diving through the breeze.  
One day, he caught a big blue wave,  
Up onto the beach,  
And now he's dead.  
You see, a fish's dream,  
Should stay in the sea.  
  
But, oh God,  
Under the weight of life,  
Things seem brighter on the other side.  
  
No way... No way... No way... Out... Of here...  
  
No way out of life.
