Oh you playing games, playing games, hurting my soul  
Seven days, seven nights, without control  
Oh every day, every night I was alone  
When you're not next to me  
Should I listen to my heart, girl  
Should I listen to my brain  
When you tell me, you leave me, and you give it up  
Can't we still be friends?  
  
Oh after your love is gone  
I don't know where I belong  
When you're not next to me, not next to me  
I'm dying, crying baby  
Oh, after your love is gone  
Oh baby I'm so alone  
When you next to me, it's ecstasy  
I'm dying, crying baby  
  
Oh you playing games, playing games, playing with love  
You can run but don't hide, can't get enough  
Anyway, anywhere, I'll be there  
Cause you're the one for me  
Cause when I give you all my heart girl  
You know I will die for you  
And when you tell me, you'll leave me, and you give it up  
I lose my destiny
