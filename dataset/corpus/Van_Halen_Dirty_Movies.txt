Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow?  
So obscene, but to me it don't matter  
Her movies get down like you won't find in my hometown  
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein'  
Go see baby now!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
  
Daddy's little sweetie after some damn rainbow  
Got the big deal in the back of a limo  
Now showbiz is so thrillin', the camera rolls she's willin'  
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein'  
Go see baby now!  
  
Hey, you remember when that girl was prom queen?  
Oh wow! Take it off! Take it all off!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
  
Now they believe it, now that they've seen it  
Go see baby now!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
Lights! Camera! Action!
