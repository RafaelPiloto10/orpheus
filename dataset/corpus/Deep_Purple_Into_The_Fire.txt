Take the trouble to decide the things you do  
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you  
See the mess your makin' can't you see your fakin'  
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire  
  
Turn on the mandrake that was given to you  
See if you can make it like the others do  
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'  
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire  
  
Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done  
Listen very closely to the message I've sung  
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'  
Gonna get a message through, you're gonna - into the fire
