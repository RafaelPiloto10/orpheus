My life, nothing was easy till now  
Hope like the morning will paint the dawn  
More than ordinary (deep down)  
Make it more than merry (deep down)  
Take me to the jamboree (deep down)  
And shine a light on me  
Draw back the curtains and smile  
Everything's wow!  
  
Girls are ten penny Janet, Joy and Jenny, Judy, Joan and Jackie G  
Hear me now I warn you  
Girls from California break your heart and set you free  
My life  
  
Shame to rely, but I swear it's the best I can do  
Like a flame, like an I with a dot I am not you  
Call me guilty I swear I'm a man who can fly (deep down)  
I keep coming back, I'll get back to you  
  
My life, nothing was easy till now
