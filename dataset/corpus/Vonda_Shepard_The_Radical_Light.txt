He was a poor boy having a hard time  
A shoulder chipped and a head for crime  
He was destined to be broken  
She found a diamond in a coal mine  
What she saw in him was a crooked line  
She just wanted him to straighten  
  
She said truth lies underneath the radical light  
Show you what you need, what you're looking for  
One night underneath the radical light  
She said once you see the truth you'll be wanting more  
  
She doesn't know why she's got the desire  
To lead this boy out of the burning fire  
Call it love or call it mercy  
See, one night she was dreamin'  
She saw a man who looked just like him,  
He said "When you find me baby set me free"  
  
We can shine standin' in the radical light  
Take a chance and find your vision  
We can feel fine walkin' in the radical light  
It all comes down to radical decisions  
  
I feel your sorrow  
I know you're afraid to let it go  
There's always tomorrow  
Come into the light you don't have to be alone anymore  
  
[Chorus: 2X]  
Show me, real truth, real love  
Wake me, hold me tonight  
Under the radical light  
Show me, the real truth, real life  
Under the radical light  
  
Someday we will be one  
Under the radical light
