I spy for the "Spirit of Curiosity"  
All the scandals of each vain monstrosity  
I gossip and I pry and I insinuate  
If the failure is great  
Then it tends to fascinate  
  
A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain  
Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane  
Her lovers fell like skittles in a 10-pin bowling lane  
But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame  
  
So you jumped back with alarm  
Every Elvis has his army  
Every rattlesnake its charm  
Can you still hear me?  
Am I coming through just fine?  
Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?  
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?  
It's such a shame you had to break the heart  
You could have counted on but the last thing you need is another  
...Episode of blonde  
  
Revolving like a jeweler's figure on a music box  
Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks  
Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot  
Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got  
To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon  
Tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan  
This stolen feeling  
Amplified up through a busted speaker  
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason  
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,  
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow  
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays  
He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze  
She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble  
Noe they are both living in a soft soap bubble  
  
The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide  
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride  
The timepiece stretched across a wrist  
She couldn't care less cast aside  
The scent that so repelled him that he swore: "insecticide"  
And there's a farewell note to mother  
That will conclude "Your loving Son"  
"Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees  
And names the painting "Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory"  
Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence  
Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense  
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls  
With puckered lips  
She's a trophy on your arm  
A magnet for your money clip  
The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say  
They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away
