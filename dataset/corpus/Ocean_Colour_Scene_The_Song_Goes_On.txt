Never left at all, you were there before  
Never let it go, now I need some more  
But you did confuse me, you get it on, get it on  
If I had to use me I'd be there in the song  
And the song goes on  
Ah yeah, and the song goes on  
I've been by the sides  
Wouldn't you agree with me?  
Never fought it off, kept away, oh, so bad  
Didn't like your world or the way you had  
You secure your choice, you're around like a voice  
Never let you know, you were there every word  
And the word goes on  
Ah yeah, and the word goes on  
I've been by the sides  
Wouldn't you agree with me?  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
Never left at all, you were there like before  
Never let it go, now I need some more  
Oh, you did confuse me, you're in my way on and on  
If I had to use me, I'd be there in the song  
And the song goes on  
Ah yeah, and the song goes on  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth  
It depends on whose doorway you walk through  
To find the truth
