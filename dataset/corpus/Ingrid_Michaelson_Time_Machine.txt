You lit the fire  
Then drank the water  
You slammed that door  
And left me standing all alone  
  
We wrote the story  
We turned the pages  
You changed the end  
Like everybody said you would  
  
I should've seen it coming  
It should've sent me running  
That's what I get for loving you  
If I had a time machine  
And if life was a movie scene  
I'd rewind and I'd tell me  
Run  
And we were never meant to be  
So if I had a time machine  
I'd go back and I'd tell me  
Run  
Run  
  
I got your letters  
I got your words  
I stacked them high  
And lit them all and let 'em burn  
  
Your broken stories  
Don't mean a thing  
You made that bed  
Good luck falling back asleep  
  
I should've seen it coming  
It should've sent me running  
That's what I get for loving you  
If I had a time machine  
And if life was a movie scene  
I'd rewind and I'd tell me  
Run  
And we were never meant to be  
So if I had a time machine  
I'd go back and I'd tell me  
Run  
Run  
  
Oh, your love, it got me higher  
Then it drove me up the wall  
But the higher up you go  
The further you will fall  
  
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, run  
  
If I had a time machine  
And if life was a movie scene  
I'd rewind and I'd tell me  
Run  
And we were never meant to be  
So if I had a time machine  
I'd go back and I'd tell me  
Run  
  
If I had a time machine  
And if life was a movie scene  
I'd rewind and I'd tell me  
Run  
And we were never meant to be  
So if I had a time machine  
I'd go back and I'd tell me  
Run  
Run
