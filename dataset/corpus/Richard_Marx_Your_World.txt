The warmest day of all my life  
You came to me  
I held you in my hands  
And something changed forever  
  
I want you for a better time  
To know the beauty of our Mother Earth  
Cherish her forever  
  
Never felt in such a hurry  
So little time, so much to do  
I lie awake and dream the dreams I'll share with you  
  
[Chorus]  
This is your world now  
No one can chase all your fears away  
This is your world now  
Trust in your heart to lead the way  
  
I still recall a day so clear  
I saw the future in my mother's eyes  
Filled with tears of sorrow  
  
The years roll by, the times do change  
The truth around us harder to disguise  
As we face tomorrow  
  
So many promises were made me  
So little hope remains alive  
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll see what I'm saying  
When you're on your own  
The war that you're facing  
Isn't yours alone  
  
I'm a man in search of reasons  
Though I am still as much to blame  
It's up to me leave you more than just my name  
  
This is your world now  
No one can chase all your fears away  
Fight for your world now  
I know that somehow you'll find your way  
Trust your heart to lead the way  
This is your world now  
I want to chase all your fears away  
Fight for your world now  
I know that somehow you'll find your way
