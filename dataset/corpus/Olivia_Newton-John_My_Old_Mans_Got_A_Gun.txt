Hey boy, I better warn you  
To make your reservation  
Your exit's overdue  
I can only promise he ain't the soul to laugh  
I've known him long enough to speak on his behalf  
  
My old man's got a gun  
And he knows you're a tricky one  
He can't fail to make you run  
And I don't need you  
My old man's got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I don't need you  
  
Hey boy, don't let him fool you  
I'll tell you something about him, gonna cool you  
He'll get you in a corner  
And make you really crawl  
You'll never realize  
A man could feel so small  
  
My old man's got a gun  
And he knows you're a tricky one  
He can't fail to make you run  
And I don't need you  
My old man's got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I don't need you  
  
I don't need you, I don't need you  
Hey boy, I better warn you  
To make your reservation
