Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When you whisper I love you and tell me that you're true  
I know I'm so lucky that I've found a girl like you  
Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When we're walking together you slip your hand in mind  
I know I'm so lucky that I've found a girl so fine  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When you touch me and hold me and kiss me tenderly I know  
I'm so lucky  
That you came along for me-e-e  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
My love I'm so in love with you
