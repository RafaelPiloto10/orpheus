I thought I heard someone crying, thought I heard someone crying  
And I thought it was me  
I thought I heard someone screaming, thought I heard someone screaming  
  
I bleed for you. I bleed for, I bleed for  
I, I, I need something to live for  
Is this the end we're deserving?  
I, I, I need something to live for  
I'm on my knees and I'm begging  
  
Something's fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to save me  
I don't believe it  
  
I thought I saw the sky bleeding, thought I saw the sky bleeding  
And I thought I saw you  
I thought I saw oceans burning, thought I saw oceans burning  
And I thought I saw you  
  
I thought I saw angels falling  
Beautiful, but still falling down  
I bleed for you  
I bleed for  
I bleed for  
  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you betray me?  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you repay me?  
  
Something's falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to take me  
I don't believe it
