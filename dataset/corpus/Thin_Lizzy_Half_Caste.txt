Halfcaste (from Man and His music Volume II)  
  
I got a girl in Brixham town  
Her daddy don't like me hangin' 'round  
The boy ain't black, the boy is brown  
Don't he know it's a halfcaste town  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
The boy is halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
I got a girl up near Richmond way  
Her daddy don't like me to lead the girl astray  
The brown boy is born to serve he say  
Don't he know it's a different day  
In the big smoke  
No joke  
Big smoke  
I like it  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Mister, I'm halfcaste  
You see, I'm halfcaste  
I got no class  
You see, I'm halfcaste  
Halfcaste
