I've seen so many smiling faces today  
But just what lies behind them I can't see  
I've lived my life in many places, you see  
Now I don't know just where I want to be  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more  
  
The years have opened up a canyon it seems  
A canyon deep and wide that I can't cross  
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes  
I've learned that every game must bear a loss  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more  
  
Don't be afraid to tell me  
That things are not the same  
I'm older now and wiser  
I know how things can change  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more
