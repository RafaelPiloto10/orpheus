I betcha my heart I love ye I betcha my dreams are of ye  
That's why I sing so loud I'm floatin' on the cloud I betcha my heart I love
ye  
I woke up this morning so early remembered your hair was curly  
I rolled over and then I dreamed of you again I betcha my heart I love ye
(yodel)  
[ guitar ]  
I'm out of this world I betcha it started the day I metcha  
When you're close to me it's just like TNT I betcha my heart I love ye  
Well I betcha my heart I love ye... (yodel)
