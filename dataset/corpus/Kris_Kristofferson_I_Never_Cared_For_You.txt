The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
the skies were never blue  
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
and I never cared for you  
  
I know you won't believe these thing I tell you  
I know you won't believe  
your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you  
and your mind cannot conceive  
now all depends on what I say to you  
and on your doubting me  
so I've prepared these statements far from true  
to fuel your disbelief  
  
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
the sky was never blue  
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
and I never cared for you  
  
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
the sky was never blue  
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
and I never cared for you  
I never cared for you
