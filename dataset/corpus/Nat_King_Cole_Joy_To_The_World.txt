Joy to the world  
The Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the earth  
The Saviour reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
He rules the earth  
With truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of his righteousnes  
And wonders of his love  
And wonders of his love  
And wonders, and wonders of his love
