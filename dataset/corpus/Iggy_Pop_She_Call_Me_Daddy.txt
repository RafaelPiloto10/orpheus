She's gone  
I froze her out  
Move by move  
First I didn't hold her hand  
Then I didn't touch her in bed  
Then I wasn't tender with her upsets  
Then I just told her to go  
And still, she didn't go  
I had to push.  
Now this place is peaceful as a grave  
It's dead quiet without her  
And her stupid T. V. Shows  
And young girl laughing  
I was always ashamed she read cosmopolitan  
I should have been proud of her  
What did she want that was so bad?  
She just wanted to believe that someone would  
Love her and look after her always  
She called me daddy  
She called me daddy
