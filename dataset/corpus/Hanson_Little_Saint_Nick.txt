Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Well, way up north where the air gets cold  
There's a tale about Christmas  
That you've all been told  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red  
And he spends all year workin' out on his sled  
  
He's a little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's a little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick  
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four-speed stick  
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel  
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel  
  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
  
He don't miss no one  
When he's haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed  
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead  
He's got to wear shades 'cause the snow really flies  
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise  
  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas  
(Christmas comes this time each year)  
Merry christmas, yeah, little Saint Nick  
(Little Saint Nick)
