People who have bad times  
Write hard luck songs  
But when their days are green  
They think about love  
Sunshine, flowers in a garden  
Did I bump you sir?  
I'm beggin' your pardon  
have you seen such a day?  
Let's begin it by startin'  
And rollin' down the hills with me.  
  
People who have short hair  
Write short hair songs  
But when their hair gets long  
They think about winding it around in daisy chains  
Waitin' for the showers  
Just to wash it in the rain  
Have you seen such hair?  
Well let the wind play  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me  
  
People who have no hills  
Write songs about plains  
But if that's not what you want to do  
Well you can jump aboard a bus  
Or boat or wooden canoe  
I know just the mountain  
That's been waitin' for you  
Too write songs about the peaks  
And the beautiful views  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me.
