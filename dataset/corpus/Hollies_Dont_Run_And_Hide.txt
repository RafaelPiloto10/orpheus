Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself  
Ask me why and I'll tell you things that you never heard now  
'Bout yourself what they're saying, I know that it will hurt you  
Please fight back, it's important how you accept their lies now  
If you run, you condemn yourself and they'll realize now  
Then you'll be hurtin' me  
'Cause I'm left on my own and I've got them to face  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself  
  
[Music Interlude]  
  
Stay with me you'll convince them all that it isn't true now  
Be with me and we'll prove just how strong our love can be now  
Please fight back, it's important how you accept their lies now  
If you run, you condemn yourself and they'll realize now  
Then you'll be hurtin' me  
'Cause I'm left on my own and I've got them to face  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide from the people
