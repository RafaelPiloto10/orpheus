I remember, walking through flowers  
In a garden of a mem'ry, I'm thinkin' of  
I remember, being in heaven  
Some other place, some other time, some other love  
I remember, walking on silver sand  
With a mid summer moon shining above  
And I remember, the taste of her sweet lips  
Some other place, some other time, some other love  
I remember holding her close to me  
And I can picture the nights we shared alone  
When I'm dreaming, it all seems so real to me  
Then I wake up and find it's all done  
Tomorrow, I may be holding another girl  
But tonight she's not the one I'm thinkin' of  
Could it be, my life would just be a mem'ry  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love
