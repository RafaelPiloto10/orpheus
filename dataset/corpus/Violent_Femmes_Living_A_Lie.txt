I'm living a lie because I can't tell the truth.  
There's a fire in the basement,  
A fire on the roof.  
I'm just sitting in my chair wearing a smile.  
I'm going to vanish in the air after awhile.  
Did did you get the news that I'm lost at sea  
Hey, hey somebody's confused though it couldn't be me.  
I wasn't near that place.  
I don't know where it was.  
She didn't see my face.  
You know its true because  
I know wise things.  
I know about these things.  
I know why it is caged,  
So I don't know why I'm enraged.  
  
I'm lying about my birth and I'm lying about my death.  
For all I'm worth, I lie with every breath.  
Lying homes are built on my crying habitations.  
Here's the milk that I spilt,  
My undying limitations  
I know about these things, I know about these things  
I know why it is caged,  
So I don't know why I'm enraged.  
  
Always the bride's maid, never the bride.  
Look what my bride's made, out of my life.  
Always the bride's maid, never the bride.  
Look what your bride's made, you shook my life.  
Always the bride's maid, never the bride.  
Look what your bride's made, and you know, you shouldn't have lied.
