I've been out of weeks for ages  
I've been on and off the train.  
I've been losing sheep  
And counting sleep  
And I've drunk too much again  
But I'll take another cup  
Even though it dry me up  
Ooh, though I know that I should pass  
I will take another glass  
  
The cellar is empty, the cupboard is bare,  
I'm joining the church and taking to prayer  
The landlord's complaining  
'Cause the rent is outstanding  
And Old Mother Hubbard's ran off with the chair  
Though I know it's time to stop  
I will take another drop  
Though I know I'm very sick  
I will take just one more sip  
  
Come on Captain, punch my ticket  
Call my mother's name  
I once heard  
That a fly can't bird  
But I drunk too much again  
Though I've really drunk a lot  
I will take another shot  
Though I know it's a time to pass  
I will take just one more glass
