A jury of my peers  
I'm ready to be ritious  
Screaming in her ears  
I'm not dignified anymore  
You can't say I didn't call  
I say I love you  
She don't hear me anymore  
  
Don't give that girl a gun  
I said now don't give that girl a gun  
She's already won  
She's already won  
  
I made a bad connection  
She says "I would have stayed"  
I jumped ship abandoned my post  
I didn't think I lost my way  
But how the mighty falls  
I saw her crack a smile  
I don't got a chance of redemption  
She don't believe in the American mile  
  
So take the first shot baby  
It will be real clean  
I'm your girl-it's all me  
And take the second shot baby  
It'll be real cold  
I'm your girl  
  
Don't give that girl a gun  
I said now don't give that girl a gun  
She's already won  
She's already won  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
I sing hold me closer  
Oh something's happening  
I can't belong again  
And I said I doubt we ever will  
Ever will again  
  
I said don't give that girl a gun  
I said now don't give that girl a gun  
She's already won, already won.
