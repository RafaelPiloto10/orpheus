I close my eyes so I don't have to see  
I shut my heart and tell my mind to run and flee  
Once I was flying, flying, flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall  
  
Would I have time to change reality  
I would become the man, the man I could never be  
Oh, my God please tell me how to break free  
Once I was flying, flying, flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall  
As long as I fall  
  
As long as I fall, I got no reason to care  
As long as I fall, I got no problem to bear  
I don't need to bother what I did or did not  
I would cry out in pain but  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
I don't need to face no blame or disgrace  
No reason to change at all  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall
