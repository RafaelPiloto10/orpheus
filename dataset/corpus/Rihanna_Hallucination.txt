What is this?  
Who is she?  
How could you do this to me  
I thought we were perfect guess I was wrong  
A fool taking all your lies  
Tricking all my senses I'm still deprived

I think I need an explanation cuz your messing up my perception  
Was it all just an illusion, think you need to wake me up

Hallucination (it keeps messing with my mind)  
Hallucination  
  
Empty inside must've been delirious out my mind  
To think that you were the one for me  
And me I'm fine thought that you were my shelter, my place to hide  
I guess you weren't the one for me
