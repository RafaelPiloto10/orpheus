Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time  
Theres something wrong here there can be no denying  
Now one of us is changing  
Or maybe weve just stopped trying  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
No  
  
It used to be so easy living here with you  
You were light and breezy I knew just what to do  
But now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
No  
  
Therell be good times again for me and you  
But we just can't stay together don't you see that its true  
Still I'm glad for what we had  
And how I once loved you  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
Its too late baby  
Its too late now darling  
Its too late
