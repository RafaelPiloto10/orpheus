Chorus:  
I have been a rover, I have walked alone,  
Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.  
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,  
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.  
There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.  
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.  
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,  
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.  
Chorus  
There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.  
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,  
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,  
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.  
Chorus
