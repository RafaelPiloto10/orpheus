Lost in cheap delirium  
Searching the neon lights  
I move carefully  
Sink in the city aquarium  
Sing in the key of night  
As they're watching me  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
  
Wrapped in silent elegance  
Beautifully broken down  
As illusions burst  
Too late to learn from experience  
Too late to wonder how  
To finish first  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
Won't you take me home  
Won't you take me home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
Won't you take me home
