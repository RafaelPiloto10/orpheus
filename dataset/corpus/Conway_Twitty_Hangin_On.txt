You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along  
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on  
It's true you have me twisted around your finger  
It seems that's where I belong  
You know how to hold me thrill me and control me  
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on  
Oh just enough to keep me a hangin' on  
My heart is like a yo-yo on a string  
I'm tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps a growing 'cause your love keeps a showing  
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on  
Oh just enough to keep me a hangin' on  
A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams  
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along  
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on oh just enough to keep me a hangin' on
