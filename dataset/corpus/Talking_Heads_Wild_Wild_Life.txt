I'm wearin' a  
Fur pyjamas  
I ride a  
Hot Potata'  
It's tickling my fancy  
Speak up, I can't hear you  
  
Here on this mountaintop  
Woahoho  
I got some wild, wild life  
I got some news to tell ya  
Woahoho  
About some wild, wild life  
Here come the doctor in charge  
Woahoho  
She's got some wild, wild life  
Ain't that the way you like it?  
Ho, ha!  
Living wild, wild life.  
  
I wrestle, with your conscience  
You wrestle, with your partner  
Sittin' on a window sill, but he  
Spends his time behind closed doors  
  
Check out Mr. Businessman  
Oh, ho ho  
He bought some wild, wild life  
On the way to the stock exchange  
Oh, ho ho  
He got some wild, wild life  
Break it up when he opens the door  
Whoahoho  
He's doin' wild, wild life  
I know that's the way you like it  
Wo ho  
Living wild, wild life  
  
Peace of mind?  
Piece of cake!  
Thought control!  
You get on board anytime you like  
  
Like sittin' on pins and needles  
Things fall apart, it's scientific  
  
Sleeping on the interstate  
Woah ho ah  
Getting wild, wild life  
Checkin' in, a checkin' out!  
Uh, huh!  
I got a wild, wild life  
Spending all of my money and time  
Oh, ho ho  
Done too much wild, wild  
We want to go, where we go, where we go  
Oh, ho ho!  
I doing wild, wild life  
I know it, that's how we start  
Uh, huh  
Got some wild, wild life  
Take a picture, here in the daylight  
Oh, ho!  
They got some wild, wild life  
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast  
Oh, ho ho  
Wild, wild  
I know that's the way you like it  
Oh, ho!  
Living wild wild wild wild, life.
