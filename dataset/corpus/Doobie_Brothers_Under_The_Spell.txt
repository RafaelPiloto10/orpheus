There's a stormy vision  
Stars before my eyes  
I seem to have this fear of the dark  
That only love defies  
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance  
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight  
When you snap your fingers and change my fate, baby  
Love gets its way and honey I must obey  
I'm under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin' down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
I'm under the spell  
A physical reaction, the doctors all agree  
Disillusion's all in my head  
It's so real to me  
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance  
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight  
When you snap my fingers and change my fate, baby  
You'll get your way - cause honey - I must obey  
  
I'm under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin' down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
I'm under the spell  
Starstruck - I stare into space  
I see the flash - then I hear the thunder  
So shocked - I'm merely a shell  
It's stranger than love -  
I'm under the spell  
  
Fools fall in love under the moonlight  
Count me as one - under the spell
