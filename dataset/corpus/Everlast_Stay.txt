I just can't do it, not anymore  
Every time I fake a smile I feel just like a whore  
I just can't do it, it's beyond my means  
And all I know about love reading fashion magazines  
I just can't do it, it can't be done  
That's just what I say cause I know I'm not the one  
  
And I've been moving for so long  
Life's a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
  
I just can't do it, it's much too hard,  
I drive around alone at night up and down the boulevard  
I just can't do it, I feel so old  
It looks like the sun is shining but the wind's blowing cold  
I just can't do it, it's gone too far  
I sit at home alone at night just wondering where you are  
  
And I've been standing still so long  
My minds a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
  
I just can't do it, no matter how hard I try  
You don't come around anymore but I know the reason why  
I just can't do it, it's way too late  
I hang on with all my might I can't accept this fate  
I just can't do it, I feel so bad  
I sit around and think about the chances that I've had  
  
And I've been hurting for so long  
You're a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
But I could not make you stay  
No, I could not make you stay
