Like everyone she knows, she's holding out for true love,  
Waiting on an answer, ready for a change.  
And everywhere she goes, she's just a little bit on the lookout.  
A day might mean tomorrow, questions still remain.  
It's not that she's so sad, she always was a happy soul.  
But lately she gets to wonder to herself, what's the good of going on anymore?  
  
I see her in her room, sitting at the window,  
Wondering if she's pretty, feeling just a little small tonight.  
She thinks of going home, giving up on the city,  
Maybe moving back down to Mobile, it's not that far to fall.  
I know she won't see me but I might just say anyhow,  
If I could be right there right now as I myself was told.  
  
Hold tight to your heart's desire, never ever let it go.  
Let nobody fool you into giving it up too soon.  
Tend your own fire, lay low and be strong, wait awhile, wait it out,  
Wait it on out, wait it out, it'll come along.

Tend your own fire, lay low and be strong,  
Wait it out, wait it out, wait it on out.  
Wait it out, let it come along, oh, wait awhile, wait awhile.
