I want to live with a cinnamon girl  
I could be happy the rest of my life  
With a cinnamon girl.  
  
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night  
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,  
My cinnamon girl.  
  
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow  
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows  
For his cinnamon girl.  
  
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night  
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,  
My cinnamon girl.  
  
Pa sent me money now  
I'm gonna make it somehow  
I need another chance  
You see your baby loves to dance  
Yeah...yeah...yeah.
