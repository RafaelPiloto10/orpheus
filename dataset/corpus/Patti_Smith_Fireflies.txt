I been walking  
Wherefore am I walking  
I been walking  
  
If you see me walking  
A-walking a-walking  
If you see me walking  
  
Don't avert your eyes  
Don't turn away  
Don't turn away  
I'm coming to you  
Oh-oh oh oh  
Oh-oh oh to you  
  
Living in steps  
Till I can rest  
Living in steps  
Till I'm blessed by you  
  
I and I alone  
Can but do for you  
To twist in my hand  
The thorn of thy youth  
To draw thy seed  
To turn in birth  
Thy sighs  
(Living in steps)  
Thy moans  
Till we can rest  
Living in steps  
Till I'm by you  
  
All I ever wanted  
  
I and I alone  
I will wash your feet  
And dry them with my hair  
I will give to you  
Every other tear  
Thy breath thy spear  
Thy season of mirth  
Seven steps  
Until I can rest  
Seven steps  
Til I am blessed by you  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted I wanted  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
Oh-wo-wo  
Oh-wo-wo  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
Five steps  
Till I can rest  
Five steps  
Till I'm blessed by you  
  
Four steps  
Till I can rest  
Four steps  
Till I'm blessed by you  
  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted I wanted  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
I and I alone  
Ghost of thy ghost  
Walk I will walk  
A burning stem  
To illume thy night  
(Three steps)  
Blood of my blood  
Bone of my bone  
(Three steps)  
Can but do for you  
I and I alone  
  
Two steps  
Till I can rest  
Two steps  
Till I'm blessed by you  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can but do for you  
I and I alone  
Oh oh oh
