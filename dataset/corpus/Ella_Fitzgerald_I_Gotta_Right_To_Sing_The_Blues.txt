I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to feel low-down  
I gotta right to hang around  
Down around the river  
A certain gal in this old town  
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around  
All I see, for me is - misery  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to moan and sigh  
I gotta right to sit and cry  
Down around the river  
I know the deep blue sea  
Will soon be callin' me  
It must be love - say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues
