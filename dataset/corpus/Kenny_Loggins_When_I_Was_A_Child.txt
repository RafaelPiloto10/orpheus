When I was a child  
So wild and free  
Sometimes I'd stumbled  
Or fall from a tree  
  
But I didn't worry  
And I didn't care  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
Oh, he was my friend  
When no one could make  
Never too busy  
Oh, he'd find a way  
  
Then off we would rambled  
With the wind in our hair  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
But time has no mercy  
For a growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
I left my heart  
When school days were through  
With visions of freedom  
Oh, when dreams do come true  
  
I've never worried  
And I've never cared  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
One night while traveling  
Word came by phone  
The message was simple  
You're needed at home  
  
So once I did worry  
For once I did care  
I prayed that my daddy would wait for me there  
  
Time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
But time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
While it makes us grow old
