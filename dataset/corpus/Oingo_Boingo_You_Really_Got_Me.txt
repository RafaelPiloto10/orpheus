Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'  
Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I can't sleep at night  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I don't know where I'm goin', yeah  
Oh Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I can't sleep at night  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
  
Please, don't ever let me be  
I only want to be by your side  
Please, don't ever let me be  
I only want to be by your side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
Oh no, no, ah  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
Oh Oh Oh
