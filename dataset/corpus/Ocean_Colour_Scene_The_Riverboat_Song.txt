I see double up ahead  
Where the riverboat swayed beneath the sun  
Is where the river runs red  
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots a dove  
And frees an eagle instead  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
  
I see trouble up the road  
Like the things you found in love are by the way  
You like to cheat on your soul  
Like the best and worst of thoughts that lose control  
Before you lie on your bed  
  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red  
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green  
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
  
It's more or less the things you fail to say in your way that's your trouble  
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars  
And his double  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red  
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green  
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
  
I see trouble up ahead  
Where the river boat swayed beneath the sun  
Is where the river runs red  
I see double, that's my trouble
