War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War!  
  
People fill the world with narrow confidence  
Like a child at birth, a man with no defence  
What's mine's my own, I won't give it to you  
No matter what you say, no matter what you do  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War!  
  
Man is far behind in the search of something new  
Like a Philistine, we're burning witches too  
This world of hate must be designed for you  
It matters what you say, it matters what you do  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War! War! War!  
  
After the bird has flown  
He walked ten thousand miles back home  
You can't do that to me, no, you can't do that to me  
You can't do that to me, no, you can't do that to me  
  
War!  
  
In this heart of mine, I'll find a place for you  
For black or white, for grown-up children too  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
  
No more war  
say no more war  
say war  
Senso hant-ai  
Senso hant-ai  
Say no more war
