Don't act like I don't know what I'm talking about  
Don't forget that I'm the one who knows you inside out  
You can't even answer when I ask you what's wrong  
Just how much longer can the silence go on?  
  
Honestly  
Honestly  
There's trouble in your heart that you can't hide form me  
Talk to me  
Cause I can see  
Your love ain't what it used to be  
If I mean anything to you  
Don't be afraid to turn me loose  
I'm strong enough to face the truth  
Honestly  
  
Just say we stand a chance  
And you're willing to try  
Or say there's nothing left for you and tell me goodbye  
We both know love has got to be an open door  
And if it's time for you to fly  
I can't hold you any more  
  
Honestly  
Honestly  
There's trouble in your heart that you can't hide form me  
Talk to me  
Cause I can see  
Your love ain't what it used to be  
If I mean anything to you  
Don't be afraid to turn me loose  
I'm strong enough to face the truth  
Honestly  
  
If I mean anything to you  
Don't be afraid to turn me loose  
I'm strong enough to face the truth  
Honestly  
Honestly
