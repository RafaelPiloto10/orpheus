While digesting Reader's Digest in the back of a dirty book store  
A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor  
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield  
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel  
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me  
"If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free"  
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said  
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead  
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see  
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree  
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead  
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said  
"But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war"  
"Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore"
