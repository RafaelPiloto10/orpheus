The breath of the morning  
I keep forgetting  
The smell of the warm summer air  
  
I live in a town  
Where you can't smell a thing,  
You watch your feet  
For cracks in the pavement.  
  
Up above  
Aliens hover  
Making home movies  
For the folks back home,  
  
Of all these weird creatures  
Who lock up their spirits,  
Drill holes in themselves  
And live for their secrets.  
  
They're all uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight.  
  
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane,  
Late at night when I'm driving.  
Take me on board their beautiful ship,  
Show me the world as I'd love to see it.  
  
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me,  
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely.  
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life.  
They'd shut me away.  
But I'd be alright, alright,  
I'm be alright,  
I'm alright.  
  
I'm just uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight.
