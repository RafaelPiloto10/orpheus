I'm waiting for my man  
Got 26 dollars in my hand  
Up to lexington 125  
Feel sick and dirty more dead than alive  
Huh, I'm waiting for my man  
  
Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown  
Hey white boy, you chasin' my women around  
Pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind  
I'm just waitin' for a dear-dear friend of mine  
I'm waiting for my man, come on  
  
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black  
Pr shoes and a big straw hat  
He's never early, he's always late  
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs  
Everybody's pinned you and nobody cares  
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste  
Then you gotta split because you got no time to waste  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Hey baby, don't you holler, don't you ball and shout  
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out  
I'm feeling good, feeling so fine  
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time  
I'm waiting for my man  
I'm waiting for my man  
I'm waiting for my man  
Man-man-man-man-man-man-man
