You better watch out  
I'm tellin' you why  
Just when you least expect it  
Just when you feel at ease  
That's when you get selected  
That's when they'll come you'll see  
So many stray transmissions  
There's nothing you can do  
So many liquid rhythms  
They'd fill a swimming pool  
Beamed from the highest mountain  
Nowhere left for you to go  
They'll take you even higher  
Than you've ever been before  
But there's no need to worry  
First you'll dip into a dream  
And in your mind it's comin'  
Like so many bright ideas  
It's all about the happen  
It's way beyond fantastic  
It's useless to resist it  
When you're finally hit with  
Pink jazz trancers  
Jazz trance for you  
Wait just for a minute  
Lay down here next to me  
Jazz trance for you  
No need for you to hurry  
Turn on the cable TV  
Jazz trance for you  
Let's close our eyes together  
Now can't you see how good  
It's gonna be...
