Mother Father please explain to me  
Why the world's so full of mystery  
A place so bitter and still so sweet  
So beautiful and yet so full of sad, sad  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
Why forests march to deserts be  
Why snow capped mountains melt away  
What do we tell our babies, what do we say  
Oh  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How a man rocks his child to sleep  
Pulls the trigger on his brother's heart  
He digs a hole right to the middle of his storm of hatred  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How it could be so this world has come to be  
A precious balance in between  
Such cruelty and such kind  
Please, please  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be  
Unequaled in her blessings, oh I see  
Unbridled hatred so extreme  
Please tell me  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be so  
Twisted between time and dreams  
Oh Mother Father please explain to me  
  
Oh what's all this talk about  
All this talk about it  
Spilling down, down, down, down, down  
All this talk about  
Endless words without  
Nothings done  
  
Mother Father do you know  
Why one man's belly overflows  
Another sleeps in hunger's bed  
Oh, we trade our world for a piece of bread  
Oh  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this rare world's come to be  
A place so full of color  
and yet overflowing always in black and white  
Drowning in the waters of our  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be  
But still blessed in all the things we see  
Such a sad, sad home for you and me  
  
C'mon, adult  
C'mon not you, c'mon not you  
Come a save yourself  
C'mon I'll do  
  
C'mon, we're taken on water  
We're taken on water, we're taken on water  
But you know  
We got the freedom!  
We got the freedom!  
There's no god above and no hell below  
It's here with us, It's up to us  
To keep afloat  
  
How this sweet world has come to be  
Oh, to keep afloat  
  
Mother Father please explain to me!  
How this rare world has come to be  
Oh, the blue planet, the blue planet  
Mother Father please explain to me  
  
Mother Father please explain
