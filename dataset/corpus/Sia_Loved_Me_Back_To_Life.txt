I was walking dead inside my head  
I couldn't get out, turn the lights down  
Voices inside are so loud.  
  
Needed a jump-start, catatonia  
I couldn't feel, I wish that I could dissapear  
The voices inside were so real.  
  
But you stood by my side.  
Night after night, night after night.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah  
  
You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive  
You loved me back to life, back to life, thought I died  
The voices inside were so quiet.  
  
But you used stood by my side  
Night after night, light up the night  
You love me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
  
Strong hands, thick skin and an open heart  
You saw through the pain, through the mask  
You never gave up on me, yeah  
  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight  
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life  
Back to life. Backt to life, back to life, back to life  
Yeah.
