You sheltered me from harm  
You kept me warm, you kept me warm  
And you gave my life to me  
You set me free, you set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
You taught me how to love  
What it's of, what it's of  
You never said too much  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, and my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
Is there someone you know  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
Yeah  
Give up my life, give up my heart  
Everything I own  
  
You know, baby  
My love for you will always be true  
That's right  
Because there is no me without you  
  
I would give everything I own  
Everything I own  
Nobody can love you, like I do  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
Just to have you back again
