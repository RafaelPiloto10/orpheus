Princess of lust  
Dignity put to dust  
A virginal sight  
Their apple to bite  
  
Drink from my thighs  
The rain of lies  
A sight so cursed  
Breasts which never nursed  
  
An Aphrodite for mortal souls  
Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles  
Their erotic hour my tearless weep  
Their satisfaction my infinite sleep  
  
Naked limbs reflecting from the moon  
I'll be there for you soon  
First wish for this night:  
Let me be your delight  
  
Body of a virgin  
Soul to the Devil's kin  
Your God is me  
In all that you see  
  
An Aphrodite for mortal souls  
Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles  
Their erotic hour my tearless weep  
Their satisfaction my infinite sleep
