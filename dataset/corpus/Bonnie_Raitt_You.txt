Nobody else can make me happy  
No one could hurt me like you do  
You were the only one that mattered  
Then you were gone  
Love had moved on  
Left me alone  
  
Thinking of you  
There was never any other  
you and I were created to dream  
  
Isn't it love that keeps us breathing  
Isn't it love we're sent here for  
Wasn't that love we were feeling  
Deep in our soul  
Deeper than we know  
Keepin' me whole  
There was never any question  
You are forever in my mind  
You and me were meant to be together  
  
I might as well have been dyin'  
When we were apart  
When you came back  
I felt the beating of my heart  
  
You and I there was never any question  
You will forever hold my heart  
You and me were meant to be together  
  
You  
It was always you
