One parrot in a cage  
At the home of a friend  
Is reason to wonder and stare  
Green wings and red face  
And a sapphire belly  
A racket so loud  
As to out shout the tele  
But this morning, my prayer  
By the side of the sea  
Took odds to turn back  
To the moon in the trees  
Where a green cloud of birds  
In a flock of a thou'  
Yelled from one to another  
It's morning out loud  
"It's morning, it's morning  
It's morning", they cried  
From the edge of the treetops  
To the edge of the skies  
"It's morning, it's morning  
It's morning", they cried  
So open your heart  
When you open your eyes  
And the sound of their voices  
Together did blend  
Forming chords of awakening  
If I'm not here again  
For they shouted  
Never again would they fly  
In such numbers across  
Such a primitive sky  
And they noticed my heart  
As it sank to the sand  
Do not hurry they called  
It's all part of a plan
