I wish, I hope, I wonder  
Where you're at sometimes  
Is your back against the wall?  
Or just across the line  
Have you been standing in the rain  
Reciting nursery rhymes?  
Trying to recall  
Some long lost kind of peace of mind  
Peace of mind  
Try spending the night sometime  
All alone in a frozen room  
Afterneath you've lain  
Your Saddle in the rain  
  
I dreamed they locked God up  
Down in my basement  
And he waited there for me  
To have this accident  
So he could drink my wine  
And eat me like a sacrament  
And I just stood there like I do  
Then I came and went  
I came and went  
Like a bird in a foreign sky  
Couldn't even say good bye  
Or come and share the pain  
My Saddle's in the rain  
  
I saw a friend who doesn't know  
If I'm his friend just yet  
His eyes and mouth were widely open  
And his jaw was set  
Like he'd fell off a cliff  
And hadn't hit the bottom yet  
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me  
Without a net  
Without a net  
I had him up to the house one time  
And we was having a real good time  
Then he went and lain  
His Saddle in the rain  
  
In a laundromat not too far  
From the Alamo  
Sits a girl who stole my records  
Very long ago  
And she wishes, wants and washes  
Out those dirty clothes  
As she shuts her eyes and dreams  
About her one eyed Joe  
One eyed Joe  
Car parked on a dirty road  
Heaven knows the load she pulled  
Couldn't take the strain  
A Saddle in the rain
