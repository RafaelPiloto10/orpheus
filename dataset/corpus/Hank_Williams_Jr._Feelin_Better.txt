Moved on down  
To sweet home Alabama in 1974  
Had to get out of Music City  
And I had to get off the road  
  
Woman, she left and the people  
Wouldn't let me sing nothin' but them old  
Sad songs, had to get high so I wouldn't cry  
You know they hit pretty close to home  
  
I'm feelin' better  
Now that I'm back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
I started turnin' up loud and looking at the crowd  
And bendin' them guitar strings  
Knew all the while, though it was my style  
Could they ever forget my name  
  
Rocked 'ed in Raleigh, knocked 'em outta Nashville  
Just couldn't do no wrong  
People went wild and the band said  
"Child, better keep on playin' your songs"  
  
I'm feelin' better  
Now that I'm back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
Well, my life ain't the same and I had to change  
And I hope this music will show  
A little bit less of cryin' in the beer  
And a little of my own soul  
  
Waylon and Toy and all them boys  
I wanna say thanks to you  
Your fiddle and your steel make me play what I feel  
And I don't feel lovesick blues  
  
I'm feelin' better  
Now that I'm back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
All came together in my sweet Alabama home  
And I'm through forever of tryin' to put everybody on  
And I'm feelin' better  
I got hurt but I'm back on the road  
  
Getting it together, had to eat a little cornbread  
I've been eatin' that cornbread, sleepin' on a featherbed  
Drinkin' that homegrown  
Writin' some new songs, do it on, get home  
  
Eat a little cornbread, lovin' on a featherbed  
Smokin' that homegrown, write a few new songs  
This here music's homegrown
