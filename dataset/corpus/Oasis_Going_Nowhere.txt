Hate the way that you've taken back  
Everything you've given to me  
And the way that you'd always say  
It's nothing to do with me  
Different versions of many men  
Come before you came  
All their questions was similar  
The answers just the same  
  
I'm gonna get me a motor car  
Maybe a Jaguar maybe a plane or a day of fame  
I'm gonna be a millionaire so can you take me there  
want to be wild 'cause my life's so tame  
Here am I, going nowhere on a train  
Here am I, growing older in the rain  
Hey hey hey hey

Here am I, going nowhere on a train  
Here am I, growing older in the rain  
Here am I, going nowhere on a train  
Here am I, getting lost and lonely sad and only  
Why sometimes does my life feel so tame ?  
Hey hey hey hey
