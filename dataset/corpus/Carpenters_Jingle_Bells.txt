Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
O'er the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells in bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells  
Jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells  
Jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh
