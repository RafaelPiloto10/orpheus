Spark my body into existence  
Breath your life into me  
Fill these eyes with temptation  
Work your mystery  
Make me in the image you desire  
Raise me up from the Earth  
Let me be your creation  
Women, give me birth  
  
Take me in your hands  
And shape me like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Put this broken body in motion  
With a strong and natural drive  
Fill my flesh with sensation  
Women let me know I'm alive  
  
Take me in your hands  
And shape me like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Like a man  
  
Take me in your hands  
And shape me like a man  
Like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Like a man  
Like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Like a man  
Shape me like a man  
Make me like a man
