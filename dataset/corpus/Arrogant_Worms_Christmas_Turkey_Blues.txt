Hey kid, why the long face  
Is it 'cause Santa Clause is flying right over your place  
You've been a bad kid all year  
So quit you snivellin' sucker and wipe up them tears  
You don't deserve a damn thing  
You're not even cute and your attitude stinks  
It must suck to be you  
Nobody likes you so what can you do  
You think you got problems kid, you think you got strife  
But come each December do you fear for your life  
I'm your turkey so your troubles are small  
I'm stuffed on your table, I'm a tasty butterball  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If you got your necked ripped out then you'd have them too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  
You sir, you look like heck  
Didn't you get your Christmas bonus cheque  
Or maybe your woman left you  
Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too  
Is that why you're wreaking of gin  
You look dishevelled and there's drool on your chin  
You thought that this love would laugh  
But she said Merry Christmas baby and she booted your ass  
Well that's tough for you mister, too bad about your ordeal  
How about getting stuffed in the wintertime, see how you feel  
I don't get to yank no bones or make me a wish  
It won't be long til I'm just some scraps on a dish  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If your butt was stuffed and roasted then you'd have then too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too
