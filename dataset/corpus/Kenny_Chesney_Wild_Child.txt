Looks like a roll and a thrift store dress  
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess  
She goes where the wind suggests she goes,  
Who knows?  
  
Got a spirit that can't be tamed  
She's a calico pony on an open plain  
I know I'll never be the same no more,  
For sure  
  
She's a wild child,  
Got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
You're falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
Never heard of her favorite band unless you  
Been to bono roux or burning man  
She's penny lane in a Chevy van,  
She loves to love  
  
She loves me  
Wild child, got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
You're falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
She'll be here until she runs  
Some just have to chase the sun  
  
She's a wild child,  
Got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
Be falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors in her wild shot  
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile  
So simple yet experimental  
Innocent but still a little wild child  
Wild child
