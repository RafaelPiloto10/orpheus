I woke up this mornin', and the world was gray.  
Haven't seen the sun since they hauled me away.  
The boss man says there's no use in tryin',  
He won't let me color outside of the lines.  
  
Got these chains on me,  
And, they're draggin' me down.  
Got these chains on me,  
Hear that clankin' sound?  
Got these chains on me,  
Mister, hear my song.  
Don't say imagination is morally wrong.  
  
Mm-hmm-hmm  
Drink of water, boss?  
  
As long as I've been here I got nothin' to show,  
Try to make somethin' but the boss says no  
Wanna be creative but the man won't hear it  
That big boss man is tryin' to crush my spirit  
  
Got these chains on me,  
They won't let me fly  
Got these chains on me,  
Won't tell me why  
Got these chains on me  
Mister, hear my song.  
Don't say imagination is morally wrong  
No, they won't let us dance or bang that gong,  
'Cause they say imagination is morally wrong!
