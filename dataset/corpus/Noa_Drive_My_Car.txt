Asked a girl what she wanted to be  
She told me: baby can't you see?  
I wanna be famous, star of the screen  
But you can do something in between  
Bay, you can drive my car  
Honeys gonna be a star  
Baby, you can drive my car  
Baby, I love you  
Told that girl my prospects were good  
She told me: baby that's understood  
Working for pennies is all very fine  
But I can show you a better time  
Baby, you can drive my car  
Honeys gonna be a star  
Baby, you can drive my car  
Baby, I love you  
Told that girl I could start right away  
She told me: baby, got something to say  
Ain't got no car, and it's breaking my heart  
But I got myself a driver  
And that's a start  
  
Baby...
