From Seven Til Ten  
Wait here for me I'll get the key  
Darlin' I won't be long  
The place isn't much but as soon as we touch  
  
Anywhere's home away from home  
It's a very nice room, do you like my perfume  
I wanted everything to be just right  
There's so little time for a love of this kind  
  
It can't even last through the night  
We have to steal all the love that we feel  
And we're feelin' like stealin' again  
We'll never be free so it's gotta be  
  
Lovin' from seven till ten  
Lovin' from seven till ten  
Do you see a trace of love on my face  
I know she'll have on the light  
  
Look in my eyes, can he see how I cried  
While you were lovin' me tonight  
We have to steal all the love that we feel  
And we're feelin' like stealin' again  
  
We'll never be free so it's gotta be  
Lovin' from seven 'til ten  
Lovin' from seven till ten
