What now my love, now that you've left me  
How can I live through another day  
Watching my dreams turn into ashes  
And my hopes into bits of clay  
Once I could see, once I could feel  
Now I am numb, so numb, I've become unreal  
I walk the night, without a goal  
Stripped off my heart and my soul  
What now my love, now that it's over  
I feel the world closing in on me  
Here come the stars, baby, tumbling around me  
There's the sky, where the sea should be  
What now my love, now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool, I'd be a fool to go on and on and on and on  
I know that no one would care, baby, no one would cry  
If I should live or die, no one would care, if I should live or die, oh, oh  
What now my love, now that there is nothing  
Only my last, my last goodbye  
What now my love, what now my love  
What now my love
