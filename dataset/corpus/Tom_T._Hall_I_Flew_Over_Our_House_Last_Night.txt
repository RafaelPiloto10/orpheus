That old Kentucky moon was shinin' bright as day  
The stars were twinklin' in the milky way  
The pilot said if you look close there's frankfort on the right  
I flew over our house last night  
  
Thirty thousand feet below me you were fast asleep  
Thirty thousand feet above i almost stopped to weep  
So close and yet so far away, so wrong and yet so right  
I flew over our house last night  
  
For just one second i thought i was back in town  
The man your friends all say has only brought you down  
The airline hostess asked me, "sir, are you sure that you're alright?"  
I flew over our house last night  
  
Thirty thousand feet below me you were fast asleep  
And thirty thousand feet above i almost stopped to weep  
I wonder did you toss and turn as i roared out of sight  
I flew over our house last night
