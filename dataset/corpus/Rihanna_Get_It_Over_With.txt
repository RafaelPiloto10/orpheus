It's dark in the day, now say, now don't complain  
Look up the sun it's just a call away  
You so afraid to cry, but your heart be feeling dry  
It's time to change  
But you keep thundering thundering  
I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering  
Won't you just pray, and get it over with  
  
Tonight feel the pain, now baby I won't complain  
I hate saying look up the sun it's just a call away  
And I was so afraid to cry  
And when you need a way to ride, that's the way  
Keep thundering thundering  
I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering  
Want to just fucking rage and get it over with  
And get it over with  
I see you rolling it  
Let's get it over with  
Get high and float again  
Roll up and go again  
I see you rolling it  
Let's get it over with  
Get high and float again  
Roll up and go again  
  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds  
  
Keep thundering thundering  
I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering  
Want to just fucking rage and get it over with  
And get it over with  
And get it over with  
  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds  
It's alright we can roll in the clouds  
Getting high we can float in the clouds
