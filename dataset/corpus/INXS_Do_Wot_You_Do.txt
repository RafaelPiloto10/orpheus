And in reflection of days gone by  
I stayed awake all last night  
When morning came, I was still unsure  
To laugh or cry, I'm needin' more  
  
And it's not easy to take the time  
From all we need, we cannot hide  
We live our dreams and all we find  
Is bittersweet and full of pride  
  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up, a little too strong  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha  
And in reflection of days gone by  
I stayed awake all last night  
  
When morning came, I was still unsure  
To laugh or cry, I'm needin' more  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up, a little too strong  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha  
  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up, a little too strong  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha

No one else can do what'cha do what'cha
