Hark listen here he comes  
Hark listen here he comes  
Turning, spinning, Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
There's no beginning  
Speeding through a charcoal sky  
Observe the truth we cannot hide  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
You'll see us all around  
You'll see us all around  
Turning, spinning, Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
There's no beginning  
You're so very far from home  
And so very much alone  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind
