Pretty little thing  
Making my heart sing  
When you do  
What you do  
I just want to know the score  
So get up on the floor  
Let me see  
Your best for me  
  
We can make it up  
Don't want to stop  
You can't get enough  
Get you feel the love  
  
Feel your heartbeat  
And your body heat  
You can't get enough  
So come on get your hands up  
  
[Chorus]  
Get up, boy  
Cause I want to chance to make you move  
Get up, boy  
Cause I want to get to know your groove  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Want to make you mine  
You are so divine  
Can't you see  
You and me  
  
Baby getting close to you  
Is so easy to do  
And tonight is the night  
We're gonna make it alright  
  
We can make it up  
Don't want to stop  
You can't get enough  
Get you feel the love  
  
Feel your heartbeat  
And your body heat  
You can't get enough  
So come on get your hands up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pretty little thing  
Making my heart sing  
Yeah  
Want to make you mine  
You are so divine  
  
[Chorus: x3]
