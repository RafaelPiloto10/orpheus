Why do we have to go and face the same routine  
And the traffic jams and crowded street's a real  
Neurotic scene  
I don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah  
Why does my girl tell me she's got to  
Have her way  
Out all night, come home to fight  
What am I to say  
I don't know, why do we take it each day  
Life is what it is  
Who wants to try not to believe  
That's the way it is  
Oh, oh  
I don't know why what you feel inside  
Days go on  
Love is something that you just can't hide  
If it's wrong  
Then you'll want to know, you don't know why  
I sing a song  
And it helps me yet I'll get by  
At times  
Lost in time sometimes your mind unwinds  
Sun does shine  
But no pleasure from your beauty's mine  
Like champagne wine  
A bitter taste that's so refined  
Life it's fine  
You always pay for what's behind  
Why do I have to go and face the same routine  
And the traffic jams and crowded street's a real  
Neurotic scene  
I don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah  
Life is what it is  
Who wants to try not to believe  
That's the way it is
