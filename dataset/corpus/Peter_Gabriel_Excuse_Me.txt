Excuse me  
You're wearing out my joie de vie  
Grabbing those good years again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me  
I'm not the man I used to be  
Someone else crept in again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me please  
I'm looking for Lost Angeles  
Soaking up the sin again  
I want to be alone  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right (Alright)  
  
Excuse me please  
You're standing on my memories  
Stealing souvenirs again  
I want to be alone  
  
Leave me alone, I want to be alone  
(repeated several times)  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska, if it all turns out right
