Everything in your shadow turns to vapour  
You pierce my heart like it was paper  
Radio's crackling with the headlines  
Sun upon your shoulder, wind's in the phone line  
American beauty will you be mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
I remember last summer drifting through our eyes  
We're in the high grass, my finger in your hemline  
Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine  
All them blue skies, ?  
American beauty wherever you'd sigh  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
Your hand cups your breast pledging your time  
The things we carried, shining skylines  
Falling sparrow, sky torn apart  
Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart  
American beauty forever mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines
