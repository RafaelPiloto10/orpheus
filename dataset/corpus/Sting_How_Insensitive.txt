Music by antonio carlos jobim, words by vinicius demoraes, translated by
norman gimbel  
How insensitive  
I must have seemed  
When she told me that she loved me  
How unnerved and cold  
I must have seemed  
When she told me so sincerely  
Why she must have asked  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to say?  
What can you say  
When a love affair is over?  
Why she must have asked  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to say?  
What can you say  
When a love affair is over?  
So now she's gone away  
And I'm alone  
With a memory of her last look  
Vague and drawn and sad  
I see it still  
All the heartbreak in her last look  
How she must have asked,  
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to do?  
What can one do  
When a love affair is over?
