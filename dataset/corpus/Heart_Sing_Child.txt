Sing child sing  
Sing child sing  
Melody Maker  
Giver and taker  
Heartbreaker  
He want to sing I know  
Try it again  
Sooner or later  
He gonna break down and sing  
  
Holy junkie  
Funky monkey  
Everybody calls him honey  
He gonna sing I know  
He don't want to play that game  
He gotta play that game  
Oh, honey, honey, honey,  
You got to come down and sing  
  
Dreamer  
Machiner  
What will you ever do when you blow a fuse  
Don't want to stay here  
Honey roll  
Sooner or later  
You've gotta get down and sing  
Sing child
