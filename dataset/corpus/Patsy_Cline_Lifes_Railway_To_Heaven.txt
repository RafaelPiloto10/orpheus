Life is like a mountain railroad  
With an engineer that's brave  
We must make the run successful  
From the cradle to the grave  
  
Watch the curves, the fills, and tunnels  
Never falter, never fail  
Keep your hand upon the throttle  
And your eyes upon the rail  
  
Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
Where the angels wait to join us  
In that great forevermore  
  
Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
Where the angels wait to join us  
In that great forevermore
