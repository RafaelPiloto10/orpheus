Well I just don't get it  
Can't make the pieces fit  
I might just as well forget it  
But my heart won't let me quit  
  
You say it's only a part of love  
That's right  
But I get a little worried sometimes  
When I start to lose  
Tired of holding it together  
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm at my breaking point  
My breaking point  
I'm at my breaking point  
My breaking point  
  
Well you're never gonna get it  
If you don't get up and try  
Try and spread those wings around me  
Honey let me see you fly  
  
You say it's only a part of love  
That's right  
But I get a little worried sometimes  
When I start to lose  
Tired of holding it together  
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe someday you'll recover  
I can see it in your eyes  
One more thing that you'll discover  
That you'll finally realize
