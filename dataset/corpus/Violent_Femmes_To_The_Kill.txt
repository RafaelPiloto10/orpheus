  
  
Ain't had no fun  
  
all the time jacking around  
  
ain't had no fun  
  
all the time messin mind  
  
I kick it around  
  
but if it's alright with you  
  
if it's alright yes I will  
  
aw c'mon babe  
  
go ahead to the kill  
  
I ain't no kid Chicago  
  
I ain't no Al Capone  
  
but there's a windy city  
  
in my bedroom alone  
  
I said I don't live in Chicago  
  
I don't know no Al Capone  
  
that bitch took my money  
  
and went to Chicago  
  
if I ain't already enough  
  
sick and alone  
  
wher's it at  
  
it's down down it's downtown
