I'm a rock and roll vagabond  
I'm a streetwise runaway  
Sixteen when I left home  
And I don't regret it a single day  
I'm a sucker for a loud guitar  
Got one tatooed on my chest  
It's hot July  
My mouth's too dry  
  
You know I'll be screamin  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
...  
...  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Got a job  
It was so damn hard  
Just workin' for the man  
All year long I saved my pay  
And I stashed it in a rusty can  
...  
And blew my head  
Then he blew me out of town  
I parked my van at the L.A. sand  
California screamin'  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
Rock all night  
Gonna blow this town  
Til morning light  
Going round and round  
Hard rock summer in the USA
