Words and music by Kaye - Weisman - Fuller  
"The Bad Seeds performed Cindy regularly in their live sets in 1990,and indeed
on a TV appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song,
but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as
'Sydney'. I think The Bad Seeds often sang 'Come on home, Sydney Cindy'
-Maurice  
Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree  
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me  
I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away  
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree  
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee  
Told them that I love you, they all know its true  
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot  
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot  
Need you in the evening when supper time is through  
What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing  
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string  
If only you would love me say it and tell me so  
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world  
Know  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
