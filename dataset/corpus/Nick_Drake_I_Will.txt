Who wouldn't do anything  
That you want them to  
Carry the world right to your feet  
If that's what you want me to do  
Didn't we laugh  
And scream and shout  
Didn't we wait  
Til it all worked out  
  
I know it's late  
And I should wait until the morning comes  
But I got a fear that wakes me up  
And I don't know where the fear comes from  
  
Didn't I bring you  
What I could bring  
Didn't I tell you  
Everything  
Well I will  
Well I will  
  
Some people talk about us  
Said we'd never get this far  
Let it all rain around us  
You know the way things are  
  
Fifteen miles from hope  
Another town another week goes by  
I'm fading away here like the birds  
That disappear into the sky  
  
Wouldn't I be there  
When you call  
I pick you up  
When you start to fall  
  
Well I will  
Well I will  
Well I will  
Well I will
