A faded wedding photograph  
You and me in our first dance  
Our eyes are closed  
We're lost in one sweet embrace  
Since those days the world has changed  
But our love remains the same  
God knows we've had our share of saving grace  
  
And I'm proud of all the blessings  
You have given me  
The mountains we have climbed to get this far  
You've learned to take the laughter with the tears  
After all these years  
  
You make it feel brand new  
After the fires that we walked through  
Against the odds we never lost our faith  
  
In our house we've made our home  
Where our children all have grown  
Precious moments time cannot erase  
  
Make a living up and down the gypsy highways  
Seasons that we've had to share apart  
Somehow in my heart I always keep you near me  
After all these years  
  
After all these years  
You stood by me  
The days and nights that I was gone  
After all these years  
You sacrificed, believed in me  
And you stood strong  
Cause with our love there's nothing left to fear  
After all these years  
  
After all these years  
You stood by me  
The days and nights that I was gone  
After all these years  
You've sacrificed, believed in me  
And you stood strong  
Cause with our love there's nothing left to fear  
After all these years
