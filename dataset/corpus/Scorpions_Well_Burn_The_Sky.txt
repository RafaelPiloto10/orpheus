I'm in love with the sunshine  
I'm in love with the fallin' rain  
Everything seems to call your name  
Yesterday you were leavin'  
  
Leavin' life and all your pain  
Everything wants you back again  
Wants you back again  
Wants you back again  
  
I found myself through you  
And there was love in my life  
I felt always naturally high  
And my love had a home  
  
But now my mind has started to roam  
You're my life giving fire  
And you carry all my love  
Through you I was so inspired  
  
You're engraved deep in my heart  
Heart, heart, heart  
  
My dreams recall us being one  
I've searched for you to be free  
The force of life you have always been  
I feel blue since you're gone  
  
You're breath of life surrounded me  
When can I join you to be free  
Join you to be free  
Join you to be free  
  
Wait, can this be a dream  
There is a voice in my head  
It belongs to you, it says  
Don't cry, no need to be sad  
  
There's a way to stay with you again  
It's more than you ever had  
And no death brings us apart  
Our timeless love always grows  
Because you are my other part  
  
I know we've never been apart  
Your love sets fire to my heart  
We'll burn the sky  
When it's time for me to die  
  
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah  
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah  
When it's time, time, time  
We'll burn the sky  
We'll burn the sky, oh yeah
