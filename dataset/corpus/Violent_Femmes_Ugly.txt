Crossed the path then I followed your face  
It was hard to believe  
It was hard to trace  
I saw you today  
  
Seems like I see you everyday  
But there's something I figured out 'bout you  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah  
So ugly  
  
I'm tellin' you straight  
So ugly  
Don't make a mistake  
Cause you're ugly  
  
You could bet it on the bank  
Say why why  
Why would I lie to you  
Why would I lie  
  
Why would I lie  
You're so ugly  
All the time  
Ugly  
  
You ain't no friend of mine  
Cause you're ugly  
You could bet it on the bank  
Say why why  
  
Why would I lie to you  
Why would I lie  
Why would I lie  
When you smile or a frown  
  
I'm so tired of you be'in around  
Engaged in some sexual acts  
Well I'm just gonna have to tell you all the facts  
What could that be about,  
  
Well here's a clue  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah  
So ugly  
I'm tellin' you straight  
  
So ugly  
Don't make a mistake  
Cause you're ugly  
I'm tellin' you that  
  
I say why why  
Why would I lie to you  
Why would I lie  
Why would I lie  
  
You're so ugly  
All the time  
Ugly  
You ain't no friend of mine  
  
Ugly  
You could bet it on the bank  
Say why why  
Why would I lie to you  
  
Why would I lie  
Why would I lie  
You're so ugly  
La la la la  
  
So ugly...
