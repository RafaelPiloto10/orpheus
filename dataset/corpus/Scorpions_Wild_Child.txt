Don't hear the phone that rings  
I know the fever's coming  
God knows what life will bring  
This Sunday morning (Sunday Morning) without a warning  
  
Don't hear the neighbour scream  
He thinks my house is burning  
Well, life is good to me  
This Sunday morning (yeah)  
  
She's a wild child  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
Don't hear the backdoor crack  
Don't see the cops are coming back  
It's burnin' in my bed  
This Sunday morning (yeah)  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's on fire  
She's on fire  
She's on fire  
  
She's a wild child  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's a wild child  
She's a wild child  
  
Yeah  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
