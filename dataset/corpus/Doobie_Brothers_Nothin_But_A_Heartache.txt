So you tell him to say no more  
You don't want to know why or where  
Where he's been all these lonely nights  
You know what's wrong and don't care what's right  
As long as he comes back to you  
Someone to love him all his life  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
It ain't nothing but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
There's always there comes a day  
When love just goes away  
When there's no caring, no words to say  
There's no forgiving, no games to play  
When all you know will get you through  
Seems like you've known it all your life  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it
