You are the One  
You are my love  
You send the rain and bring the sun  
You stand alone and speak the truth  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One  
  
You're in my dream  
I hold you there in high esteem  
I need you more each step I take  
You are the love in life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One  
  
You are the one that I'd die for  
And you're all that is real  
You are the essence of that which  
We taste, touch and feel  
  
You are the One  
No matter what  
You are the real love that I've got  
You are my friend and when life's through  
You are the light in death itself, oh yes are  
You are the One  
  
They call you Christ, Vsnu, Buddha, Jehovah,  
Our Lord  
You are, Govindam, Bismillah, Creator of All  
  
You are the One  
No matter what  
You are the real love that I've got  
You are my friend and when life's through  
You are the light in death itself, oh yes are  
You are the One  
You are my love  
You send the rain and bring the sun  
You stand alone and speak the truth  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One
