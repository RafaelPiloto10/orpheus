It's hard to breathe, from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
It's hard to take, It's tough to break  
So I don't make the same mistakes  
  
The same mistake, (4x)  
  
Out in the yard is where I play,  
Don't come in cause I'm afraid  
You saw my face, I faced my friends  
Do I tell or just pretend?  
I found a friend, a friend who knows  
Who says he'll help but then he goes  
  
And then he goes (4x)  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
  
Fingernails, filled with dirt  
If you don't tell, you don't get hurt  
I cry for help, I pray to God  
Another tear he tries to rob  
To rob me of, my dignity  
Cause sanctuary's far from me  
  
Far from me (4x)  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
  
So broke inside, don't run away  
And find another place to stay  
And make our inhibition go away  
Because I'm so afraid, yeah, yeah  
  
It's hard to breathe, from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
It's hard to take, It's tough to break  
So I don't make the same mistakes  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
