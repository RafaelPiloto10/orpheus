(The Zombies)  
  
The warmth of your love's  
Like the warmth from the sun  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
Don't let go of my hand  
Now the darkness has gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And I won't forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I won't forget  
The way you said "darling, I love you"  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now we're there  
And we've only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
The warmth of your smile  
Smile for me, little one  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
You don't have to worry  
All your worried days are gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And I won't forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I won't forget  
The way you said "darling, I love you"  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now we're there  
We've only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...
