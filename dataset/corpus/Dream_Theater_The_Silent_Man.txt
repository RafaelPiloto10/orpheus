A question well served  
Is silence like a fever,  
A voice never heard  
Or a message with no receiver?  
  
Pray they won't ask  
Behind the stained glass  
There's always one more mask  
  
Has man been a victim  
Of his woman, of his father?  
If he elects not to bother  
Will he suffocate their faith?  
  
Desperate to fall  
Behind the great wall  
That separates us all  
  
When there is reason tonight I'm awake  
When there's no answer arrive the silent man  
If there is balance tonight he's awake  
If they have to suffer there lies the silent man  
  
Sin without deceivers  
A god with no believers  
I could sail by on the winds of silence  
And maybe they won't notice  
But this time I think it'd be better if I swim  
  
When there is reason tonight I'm awake  
When there's no answer arrive the silent man  
If there is balance tonight he's awake  
If they have to suffer there lies the silent man  
There lies the silent man
