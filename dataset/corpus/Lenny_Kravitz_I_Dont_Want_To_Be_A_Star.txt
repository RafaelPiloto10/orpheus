I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
'Cause I don't get off on my fame  
I got so much confusion now  
Sometimes I don't even kno my name  
  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
Too many distractions run through my brain  
So many girls they start to look the same  
Too many options no time to choose  
Too many clothes, too many shoes  
  
I've had the world I've done it upside down  
I played the part and I've been the clown  
Now it's my time, it's a brand new day  
To be myself in a different way  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
I got to meet all the wonderful people  
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool  
I got to meet all the fabulous people  
I got high with Jagger, it was really cool  
  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
Never.
