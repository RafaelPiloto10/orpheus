Ok, ah, we're back again and of course you're listening to W.B.A.I. in New
York and this program is labrish  
My name is Hab? Salashi and we're speaking with Baba, or maybe Rash Baboa  
Can I try and give a message? Hallo?  
Go, go ahead man  
Yeah, I just like to say, uhm, lets have some music now eh  
Ok, ok, thank you  
Yo right  
  
Now lightning strikes in old New York  
It may be dark but I wanna talk  
It might rain, it might snow  
There's too many things I got to know  
If this is spring than it's time to sing  
Never mind the l'il birdies wing  
Look out, look out, old New York  
New York's coming and New York talks  
Hey, strike  
Not once, strike, but twice  
Get out your money, peel a slab  
Roll some notes and hail a cab  
Drive in church, drive in back  
Drive down Seventh in a tank  
Take in the sights, feel the breeze  
See New York's one and only tree  
It can be found in Garbage park  
But don't inspect it after dark, no  
Strike  
New York  
Lightning  
Not once but twice  
Accidental hike in the transit strike  
Roller skate or ride a bike  
Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge  
You won't get far if you're privileged  
Graffiti Jack sprays in black  
An Englishman, can he read it back?  
Deli Joe, he ought to know  
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row  
Strike  
Lightning  
Strike  
Because glass to glass, street to street  
Buildings touch St. Peter's feet  
From car to bar, from prez to shah  
Everything is in the jar  
The four winds blow 'cause the four winds know  
Takes a special hustle to make a roll  
Honey girl on her feet  
I wish everything to make her sweet  
(Strike) Strike  
Yeah, strike hits twice  
Not once but twice (Strike)  
Ok, so roll  
Ya'll  
Serieus  
Ya'll  
From Harlem  
Strike one  
Lightning strike  
  
Harlem slum to penthouse block  
On every door I already knocked  
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone  
Somebody lying under every stone  
Everything that a man could need is in a bag down by my knee  
That looks good and this ain't got seeds  
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery  
Lightning strike (Strike)  
Old New York  
Everything's light  
Bumb, oh, he touched you there  
(Strike) Strike  
Hey ho, such a night  
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike  
A polaroid caught in the act  
You're married too and that's a fact but I won't peek and I won't squeek  
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street  
It's Cuban Day  
Oi Vey  
Chinese New Year, let's call it a day  
Look out, lightning strike  
Tootsie  
Fox, fox, what, what've you got?  
Hey bully  
Oh, strike  
Lightning  
  
Hey, Chi man  
That melody is Puerto Rican  
Hey Chi man, is what he's speaking  
And there's the road down into London Town where many cars get broken down  
It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove  
Runs down to Old Hounslow  
Hash my brother, caught a fuff  
Because, because you know it  
Just thought I'd mention the new extention that run's down the 59th street
intersection  
Did you hear the news y'all?  
London Town on the Broadway  
Strike
