I like to take a walk out in the midday  
Checking life out in the park  
I like to take a walk out in the midday  
But avoid city after dark  
  
Oh, I love to see the children playing in the rain  
Splashing books and kicking mud  
Oh, I love to see the kids playing in the rain  
But avoid city after dark  
  
I love to feel the ocean blowing in my face  
Wave as the old boats depart  
I love to feel the wind blowing in my face  
But avoid city after dark
