All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you  
I don't want to compete with you  
Beat or cheat or mistreat you  
Classify ya, simplify ya  
Deny, defy or crucify you  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
No, I ain't lookin' to fight with you  
Frighten you, uptighten you  
Bring you down or chain you down  
Drag you down or bring you down  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you  
I don't want to meet your kin  
Make you spin or do you in  
Or select you or dissect you  
Or respect you or reject you  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be friends with you  
Baby, be
