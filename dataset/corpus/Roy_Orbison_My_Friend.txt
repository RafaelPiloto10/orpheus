If I my friend can't tell you.  
When you my friend are wrong.  
Not to do what you want to  
Just because it's wrong.  
  
Well then my friend in passing.  
We've been friends too long.  
And I my friend must tell you,  
Leave that woman alone.  
  
Your little girls might not understand,  
And you know the baby would cry.  
And what would you do if their mommy knew,  
And she told you "goodbye"?  
  
Let it end my friend say it's over,  
And thank the stars above.  
That you've got a home to run to,  
And a sweet sweet woman to love.  
I must say my friend if you stay my friend.  
Leave that woman alone.leave my woman alone.
