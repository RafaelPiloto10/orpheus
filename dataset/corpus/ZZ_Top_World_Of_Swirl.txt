I hit the street running, had an angle in mind  
Looking for a shelter, doing double overtime  
I get a little crazy, but I won't be denied  
Gotta find the time that takes the inside outside  
  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
Everything's hazy, everything's a blur  
  
Isn't it amazing? checking outta where we were  
It's so unpredictable, at the end of my rope  
Gotta skate the ledge outta this kaleidoscope  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
In this cloud of dust, you've got to keep steady  
Hang on you must, you better get ready  
  
Over the ledge, ripping the curl  
Riding the edge off into to twirl  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
  
In a world of swirl
