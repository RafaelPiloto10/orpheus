[B.G.]  
Niggas be hating 'cause B.G. got it  
On top of the line only got it but I ride it  
From the hummer to the rover to the project  
B and C Lex truck nothing in my click ain't hey  
Everybody here was fucked when they heard 'bout the deal  
Cash money hot boyz sound for thirty mill  
Already was straight but we living larger  
Already was balling but now we balling harder  
Bet you bitches can't stay clean  
Cause my wrist stay flossed off  
Niggas hate me 'cause all day I'm flossed off  
Ghetto lady in my dog bay Mercedes  
Niggas find out they got whole got fuck it then they cave me  
That's how it go it ain't my fault  
I got mega cheese  
Walk that walk, talk that talk  
I'm B.G.  
Papers chase so footy get my grind on  
I look through it 'cause I made that song gets it shine on  
  
[Chorus]  
My click be sizziling hot steaming  
Bouncing rules diamonds hot beaming  
Me and my click be sizziling hot steaming  
Stepping throught niggas diamond hot beaming  
Me and my click be sizziling hot beaming  
Rep out niggas diamonds hot beaming  
  
[Lil Wayne]  
What what what  
I'ma flosser baby  
Baller baby  
A fifteen year old shot caller baby  
I'm raised in the hood  
In a all black call  
Down Mercedes cool  
Got your wife at my house and she naked too  
And all my niggas all around us saying shake it boo  
Go ahead do what you do  
It's weezing darling off that heezing darling  
I', surrounded by the ice it got me freezing darling  
It's plain and simple  
My change and it's natural  
Now Wayne will pimp ya'll  
Got game from beatrall  
Trying to see six numbers  
At the Grammy awards with six hummers  
Me the Grammy award with six woman's  
Nigga stop at the gas station for six rubbers  
Put it together  
This is the night for you to get under the cheddar  
Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Lil Wayne]  
Here I come star rapper  
I get the fast money  
Short cute hot boy  
And rap for cash money  
Stand out the roof of my car and flash honeys  
Take your girl to the mall and spend a gee like it's nothing  
If you lay on the floor  
Open up the spot  
Take off her draws  
Let me see the cot  
Don't stop  
Lil' Weez lil' weez and nothing nice  
But yet to my Jesus Christ  
Nothing but ice  
When they see me at night  
Behind Cristal see night  
Snatch your wife  
Run up in there with the K why  
It's all mine  
Ever since I was born Wayne  
Nigga get out of line I get dirty like John Wayne  
I bought something to floss it  
Whatever come with it  
Now don't shoot us unless they have a drum with it  
At first they weren't with it  
But then I was choking  
I got 'em all paying attention like they owe it  
What  
  
[Chorus]
