I want to live in a holy city  
I want to drink from a holy vine  
I want to be where the people are pretty  
Just because their feeling it deep down inside  
I don't want to wait for heaven  
I can find what I need right here on earth this time  
Theres too many people theyre waiting for heaven  
Oh let me tell you if you can't feel it here  
You wont feel it there anyway  
Oh anyway  
  
I want to live in a stained glass window  
I want to change with the light of day  
I'm gonna have the sun shining through me  
Causing my existence in every way yeah

I can find what I need right here on earth this time  
Too many people their waiting for heaven
