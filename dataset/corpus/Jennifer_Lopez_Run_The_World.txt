We got it locked, they know, that  
Whenever we around it goes down like Draino  
And it's nothing to spend these pesos  
And you will never see us with a fake one  
You can call it in the low, low  
Police on our arms with a thousand in the trunk  
Ain't nothing greater, hanging out the window  
Straight busting at you law haters  
  
Bonny Clyde  
No other girl will ever ride like I ride  
That's why you need me on your passenger side  
Let me help you get that paper  
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters  
Me and you,  
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth  
There's never a question of what I'll do  
Uh huh for you with me you'll never lose so,  
  
[Chorus]  
Call on your girl that can hold you right  
I'll be your protector I'll never forget you  
You need somebody that can hold you tight  
I'll be in your arm love  
Keep you out of harm boy  
I'll be your anything, everything  
Rockin' roll with you  
If things get to hot out in the cold with you  
Froze froze with you, me and you together  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world  
I'll be your anything everything rockin' roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze, froze with you  
Me and you together our love could run the world  
[Repeat: x15]  
Run  
  
Make it through any weather baby  
Don't pay them any attention  
It'll just drive you crazy  
All that really matters is our love for one another  
And all we'll ever have is each other  
Let her chit-chatter come around  
Lord knows she'll never be done  
She'll never have your back, wouldn't know how to act  
I can't say it all better than that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love could run the world  
  
Don't you see, there's no love no like you and me  
Can't you see, baby there's nobody more powerful than we  
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need  
Can't you see that, can't you see  
  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world  
I'll be your anything everything rockin' roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze, froze with you  
Run the world, our love could run the world  
[Repeat: x15]  
Run  
  
Run the world, our love could run the world
