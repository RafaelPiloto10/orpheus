Do you remember Hullabaloo,  
Upbeat, Shindig and Ed Sullivan too?.  
Do You Remember Rock 'N' Roll radio?  
Do You Remember Rock 'N' Roll radio?  
  
Do you remember Murray the K,  
Alan Freed, and high energy?  
It's the end, the end of the seventies  
It's the end, the end of the century.  
  
Do you remember lying in bed with your covers  
Pulled up over your head? Radio playin' so one can see.  
We need change, we need it fast before rock's just part  
Of the past, ause lately it all sound the same to me.  
  
Oh-oh.  
Will you remember Jerry Lee,  
John Lennon, T. Rex and Ol' Moulty?  
It's the end, the end of the 70's.  
It's the end, the end of the century.
