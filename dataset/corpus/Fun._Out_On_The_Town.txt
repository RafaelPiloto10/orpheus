I set all my regrets on fire  
Cause I know I'll never take the time  
To unpack my missteps and call all of our friends  
I figure they would take your side  
  
I make the bed, just not that well  
Your name comes up a lot  
When I talk to my mom  
Oh, I think she can tell  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
So maybe I should put up a fight  
I'll call them back and borrow a box knife  
So I can learn to live with all the stupid shit I've been doing since ninety
nine  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
But I'm waiting for the day you come back and say  
"Hey, maybe I should change my mind"  
  
I drink a lot  
I'm not sure if that's new  
But these days when I wake up from a night I forgot  
I just wish that it never came true  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more clever  
  
I knew there would come a day when all was said and done (And I know I could
be more clever)  
Everything I was is everything but gone (And I know I could be more strong)  
All my big mistakes are bouncing off your wall (And I know I could be more
clever)  
The bottles never break, the sorrow never comes (And I know I could be more
clever)  
So come on let me in, I will be the sun (And I know I could be more clever)  
I will wake you up, I am who [?](And I know I could be more strong)  
Just open up your heart, open up your heart, open up your heart (And I know I
could be more clever)  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh
