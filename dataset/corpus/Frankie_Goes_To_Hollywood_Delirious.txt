Wow!  
  
On again, ... Are you still smoking now? ... Are you still smoking?  
  
I don't care what you do honey  
You can even spend my money... Now  
This boring night has passed me by  
I'm Sick and tired just getting high  
  
Life is hard and mean and tough  
But sometimes love is not enough  
  
I don't wanna spend all my days  
Rolling around in a Purple Haze, Purple Haze.  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Delirious  
  
I can see your body getting sicker girl  
From all those devil pills and liquor  
And in your head, its in a mess  
So stop all this destructiveness  
  
Delirious, Delirious, Delirious, Delirious.  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
I might as well get me a gun but when all is said and done  
Life can be fun, life can be fun  
  
Delirious  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Life is hard and mean and tough  
But sometimes love is not enough  
  
I don't wanna spend all my days  
Rolling around in a Purple Haze, Purple Haze.  
  
Now... And Go.. Its still smoking  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Delirious, Delirious, Delirious, Delirious  
  
You may be Delirious
