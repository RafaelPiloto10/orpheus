It's not the chapters he reads  
When you're feeling low down.  
It's not the touch of his skin  
When you kiss him goodnight.  
It's not the money he spends  
When you want to buy a daydream  
And not that miracle smile  
That makes the sky bright.  
  
It's not the way his hands behave  
When you've turned out the light.  
  
It's the small small small talk that makes it all happen.  
Small small small talk that makes you want to fly,  
Yes it does.  
  
It's not the way he believes  
In you like a religion.  
It's not the thrill that you get  
When he's holding you tight.  
  
It's not the way his eyes persuade  
You to stay the night.  
  
It's the small small small talk that makes it all happen  
(Just like that)  
Small small small talk that makes you feel like flying,  
Yes it does.  
  
Information, heart and soul, a whisper, a word,  
Confessions that have to be heard.  
Small small talk, small small talk.  
  
Come on now, come on now, come on -  
You make it rock so heavenly.  
  
Come on now, come on now, come on -  
You seem to talk so heavenly.  
Big words... Small talk...
