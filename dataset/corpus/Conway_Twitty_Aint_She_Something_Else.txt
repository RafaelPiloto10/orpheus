Don't you like the way she talks to you  
When she's feeling woman warm  
And don't it make you feel so good  
Just to know she's yours all by yourself  
  
Don't you like to see the sun go down  
When she's lying close to you  
And can't you feel her all around  
And when she loves you ain't she something else  
  
Chorus:  
Ain't she just some kind of lover in the morning  
Can't your arms feel the warmness where she slept  
Ain't she just all that you have ever wanted  
And when she loves you ain't she something else  
  
Don't you like the way she clings to you  
And loves you 'til there's nothing left  
Now tell me don't her lips taste good  
And when she loves you ain't she somthing else  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
Lord, When she loves me she's sure something else
