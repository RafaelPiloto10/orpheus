This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely Winter's night  
And if I want to think someone's thinking of me  
I look into my song, see who I can see  
  
My pace is curlin', hurlin' now, from key to key  
Written through the gloom  
Of a lonely empty room  
All the lines start to unlock my mind and I feel free  
The Winter's night gives way to a warm Summer's day, yeah, yeah  
  
The light's turned off, but there's nobody to turn on  
And there's no happiness in having to undress  
I put such thoughts aside and listen to my song  
Now, it makes things better  
My song does the rest, yeah  
  
This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely winters night  
And if I want to think of someone's thinking of me  
I look into my song and see who I can see
