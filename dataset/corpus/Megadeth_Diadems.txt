Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today  
The more insatiable the sex, the more swelled our tongues became  
As prehistoric as this seems, this is now, today  
Talkin' about no vision, talkin' about no dream  
The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks  
I look above and see entrails in the sky  
This one ain't over until the fat lady dies  
One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast  
Ten Diadems to crown them all  
World religion at his feet  
Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come  
So run my child and hide your face  
Once you've been marked you're finished, one  
You've become one!  
You're mine!  
You're one.  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away  
Vengeance is mine!  
Vengeance is mine!  
The Netherworld and Sheol and never satisfied  
So the eyes of man are never satisfied  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away
