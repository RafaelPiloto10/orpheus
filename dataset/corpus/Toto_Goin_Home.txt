Midnight on a southern highway  
Don't know if I'm going the right way  
I haven't seen a single sign for miles  
All this stormy weather  
Keeping us from being together  
How long has it been since I've seen your smile  
In this tunnel called the night  
I can finally see a light  
I've got a burning deep inside  
I thought you might understand  
I'm drivin' as fast as I can  
And you said you'd wait for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Goin' home  
'Cause I've been away much too long  
Goin' home  
Going back to the place where my heart belongs  
Goin' home  
Going back where I left my family  
Goin' home  
And I hope that they're still waitin' there for me  
  
In the eyes of the legal tender  
You're the one who must surrender  
I think they call it responsibility  
I'm a man in emotion  
With only one compulsion  
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart  
I'm not looking for a fight  
No one's wrong and no one's right  
Maybe we all need time apart  
So please understand  
I'm doin' the best that I can  
And you said you'd wait for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I thought you'd might understand  
I'm drivin' as fast as I can  
And you said you'd wait for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Going home  
Going home  
Yeah, baby
