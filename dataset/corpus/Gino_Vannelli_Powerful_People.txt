Look at the powerful people  
Stealing the sun from the day  
Wish I could do something about it  
When all I can do is pray  
  
It's a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And Sunday when there's time  
I think of these things on my mind  
And I don't know  
Where I will go  
  
Look at the ominous people  
Draining the salt from the sea  
Wish I could just stand up and shout it  
Why can't they let goodness be  
  
Oh it's a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And some day when there's time  
I think of these things on my mind  
And I don't know  
Where I will go  
  
Come on you world won't you give a damn  
Turn on some lights and see this garbage can  
Time is the essence if we plan to stay  
Death is in stride when filth is the pride of our home  
Wish I could just stand up and shout it  
Why can't they let goodness be  
  
Oh it's a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And Sunday when there's time  
I think of these things on my mind  
  
Oh and Monday there's no time  
So I close both my eyes and I'm blind  
And I don't care where oh where is my prayer
