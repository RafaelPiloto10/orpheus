I got 5 kisses, where you want 'em at?  
Either one on your lips  
Your ear, your neck  
Your stomach or your back  
  
Your inner thigh, right on your knee cap  
Or your belly button  
These other guys be out here talkin'  
But they steady frontin'  
  
They don't know what they want  
That's why I tell you, put your trust in me  
Share all your secrets  
Your desires and your fantasies  
  
I ain't gon' tell nobody, baby  
I'm an only child  
I'd keep it to myself  
'Cause all I wanna do is see you smile  
  
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to  
Ain't that what you want?  
I'll be your lover  
Your provider and your confidante  
  
And I won't judge you  
'Cause I know that ain't nobody perfect  
But you got some perfect imperfections  
And that makes you worth it  
  
I wanna see your body in all  
The positions that you like it in  
We could do it slow or have some drinks  
And it gets enticin' when  
  
You like it rough, I give it rough  
And I start to pull your hair  
'Cause ecstasy's your destination  
And I'mma take you there  
Tell me a secret, baby  
  
Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows  
And I'll think about it just soon as the door closes  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees  
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
There ain't nobody in the universe  
That competes with you  
Imagine the possibilities  
And other little freaky thangs that we could do  
  
Blind folded, handcuffed to the head board  
Never let you go until you scream my name  
Maybe you think I'm playin'  
But this is really far from a motherfuckin' game  
  
Ain't a damn thang changed  
Still nasty as I wanna be  
And I got just what you been lookin' for  
Baby-girl, you want it, see  
  
It'll turn you on and it's gonna be on  
Soon as I take it off  
Just give me your body it's guaranteed that  
I'mma break it off  
  
Off, off, off  
Off until the sun rise  
And I'm not here to disappoint  
Just give me one try  
  
One kiss, one pinch  
And you could take it or leave it  
But before you make up your mind  
Just tell me one secret  
Ne-Yo, holla at 'em  
  
Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows  
And I'll think about it just soon as the door closes  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees  
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
So we can talk about your fantasies  
And ain't nobody gotta know but me  
Baby, come on and make this move if you gonna  
Baby, we grown, we can do what we wanna  
  
Yeah, said you can tell me what you like to do  
Baby-girl, you never know, I may like it too  
Baby, come on and make this move if you gonna  
Baby, we grown, we can do what we wanna, yeah  
  
Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows  
And I'll think about it just soon as the door closes  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees  
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me  
Tell me a secret, baby  
Tell, tell, tell me a secret, baby  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Tell me a secret  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Tell me a secret
