If I knew then what I know now  
  
Well, hello girl, tell me, how have you been?  
By the way, I'll never make the same mistake again  
And you know girl, it's been a long hard time  
Nothing like back when you were mine.  
  
And if I knew then what I know now  
I'd have found the way  
To make things work out somehow  
I'd have held you tight  
I'd have treated you right  
If I knew then what I know now.  
  
It's a crazy world for a boy and a girl  
Harder than it is for a woman and a man  
Oh, it was easy then just to push you away  
Guess I never knew how I feel today.  
  
If we knew then...  
  
You know I do things differently  
If you ever come back to me  
If we could just go back in time  
There's no broken heart  
Girl, we're at the start this time.
