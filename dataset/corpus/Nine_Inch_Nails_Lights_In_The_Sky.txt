She's mostly gone, some other place.  
I'm getting by, in other ways.  
Everything they whispered in our ear,  
Is coming true.  
  
Trying to justify the things I used to do,  
Believe in you.  
  
Watching you drown,  
I'll follow you down,  
I am here right beside you.  
  
The lights in the sky  
Have finally arrived  
I am staying right beside you.  
Trying to stay away,  
Just in case.  
I've come to realize we all have our place  
Time, time has a way, you know, to make it clear.  
And I have my room and yes, I can't disappear,  
Or leave you here.  
  
Watching you drown,  
I'll follow you down,  
And I am here right beside you.  
The lights in the sky are waving goodbye,  
And I am staying right beside you.
