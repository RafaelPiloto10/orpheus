I drove through the desert last night  
I carried the weight of our last fight  
Elvis singing "don't be cruel"  
And I wonder if you feel it too  
It's like we're going under  
  
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line  
The question of my heart came to my mind  
  
If I go on  
With you by my side  
Can it be  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about those golden nights?  
  
Maybe a thief stole your heart  
Or maybe we just drifted apart  
I remember driving  
In my daddy's car to the airfield  
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield  
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust  
That paradise is buried in the dust  
  
If I go on  
With you by my side  
Can it be  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about those golden nights?  
(The way it was)  
  
All of our plans have fallen through  
Sometimes a dream, it don't come true  
  
Darling!  
Darling!  
  
If we go on  
Can it be (can it be)  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about them golden nights?  
  
If I go on  
With you by my side  
Can it be  
The way it was  
My heart is true  
Girl, it's just you  
I'm thinking of  
Can it be the way it was?  
  
Maybe a thief stole your heart
