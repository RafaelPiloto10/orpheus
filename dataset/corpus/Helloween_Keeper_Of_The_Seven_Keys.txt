Make the people  
Hold each other's hands  
And fill their hearts with truth  
You made up your mind  
So do as divined  
  
Put on your armour  
Ragged after fights  
Hold up your sword  
You're leaving the light  
  
Make yourself ready  
For the lords of the dark  
They'll watch your way  
So be cautious, quiet and hark  
  
You hear them whispering  
In the crowns of the trees  
You're whirling 'round  
But your eyes don't agree  
  
Will'o'the wisps  
Misguiding your path  
You can't throw a curse  
Without takin' their wrath  
  
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin  
Or all us people forget what we've been  
Our only hope's your victory  
Kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
That lock up the seven seas  
And the Seer of Visions said before he went blind  
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind  
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold  
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold  
  
You can feel cold sweat  
Running down your neck  
And the dwarfs of falseness  
Throw mud at your back  
  
Guided by spells  
Of the old Seer's hand  
You're suffering pain  
Only steel can stand  
  
Stay well on your way and follow the sign  
Fulfull your own promise and do what's divined  
The seven seas are far away  
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Throw the first key into the sea of hate  
  
Throw the second key into the sea of fear  
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness  
And make the people hold each other's hands  
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed  
  
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance  
Disease, disease, disease my friend  
For this whole world's in devil's hand  
Disease, disease, disease my friend  
Throw the key or you may die  
  
On a mound at the shore of the last sea  
He is sitting, fixing your sight  
With his high iron voice causing sickness  
He is playing you out with delight  
  
"Man who do you just think you are?  
A silly bum with seven stars  
Don't throw the key or you will see  
Dimensions cruel as they can be"  
  
Don't let him suck off your power  
Throw the key...!  
  
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground  
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!  
  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
You locked up the Seven Seas  
And the Seer of Visions can now rest in peace  
There ain't no more demons and no more disease  
And mankind, live up, you're free again  
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown  
You have given our souls back to light
