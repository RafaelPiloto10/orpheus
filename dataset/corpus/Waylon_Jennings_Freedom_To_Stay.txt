I tied my bandana,took my pack from the floor  
You were still sleeping,as I stood at the door  
Once more I was heading to,God only knows where  
That's when it hit me,I was already there  
Chorus:  
I could ramble,a thousand miles or more  
Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before  
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way  
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay  
Why keep on running,just to wish on a star  
Searching for Heaven,when I know where you are  
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone  
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home  
Chorus
