I've only myself to blame,  
Now that I'm tangled up in chains,  
So you say, ooh, so you say  
Caught in this human cage,  
Trapped, and I'm fired up with rage  
And somebody's got to pay  
I can never talk about it,  
I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
You say I'm a man of straw  
Well, baby, I'm gonna break your law  
Then it's war, ooh, yes it's war  
Love on a thin white line,  
Love that was just a waste of time,  
Oh, not anymore  
I can feel it coming at me,  
I can feel it coming like the wind  
But, I'm locked away and I'm bound to stay,  
So no one can get in  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
There must be a reason why  
You're pulling the wool down on my eyes  
It's a lie, it's a lie  
Dragging this ball and chain,  
Oh, how long can I take this pain?  
But somebody has to try, yeah  
Oh, I can feel the pressure on me,  
I can feel it taking me from the start  
Sticks and stones will smash my bones,  
But never break my heart  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
I can never talk about it,  
Oh, I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains
