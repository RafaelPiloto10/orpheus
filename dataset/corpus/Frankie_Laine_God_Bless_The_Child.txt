Them thats got shall get  
Them thats not shall lose  
So the Bible said and it still is news  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Yes, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets dont ever make the grade  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Money, youve got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
When youre gone, spending ends  
They dont come no more  
Rich relations give  
Crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But dont take too much  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
He just worry bout nothin  
Cause hes got his own
