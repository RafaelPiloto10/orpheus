Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty,  
Put me on the train for London Town,  
Take me anywhere,  
Drop me anywhere,  
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham  
But I don't care,  
I should like to see my...  
  
I don't bless them  
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes  
Hemmed in like a boar between arches  
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling  
I'm truly sorry - but it sounds like a wonderful thing  
  
I said Charles, don't you ever crave  
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail  
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?  
Oh...  
And so, I checked all the registered historical facts  
And I was shocked into shame to discover  
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendant  
Of some old queen or other  
  
Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?  
  
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs  
I swear to God  
I swear : I never even knew what drugs were  
Oh...  
So, I broke into the palace  
With a sponge and a rusty spanner  
She said : "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"  
I said : "That's nothing - you should hear me play piano"  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron  
No-one talks about castration  
Oh...  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
Like love and law and poverty  
Oh, these are the things that kill me  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But the rain that flattens my hair...  
Oh, these are the things that kill me  
  
All their lies about make-up and long hair, are still there  
  
Past the pub who saps your body  
And the church who'll snatch your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
Past the pub that wrecks your body  
And the church - all they want is your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely
