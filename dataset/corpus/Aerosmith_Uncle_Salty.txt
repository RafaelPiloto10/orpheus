Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely  
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead  
My mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted  
They left her to be trusted till the orphan bleeds  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby  
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see  
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others  
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, oh yeah  
Oooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah  
  
Now she's doin' any for money and a penny  
A sailor with a penny or two or three  
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-runnin'  
They all come for fun and it seems to me  
That when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window [Repeat to fade]
