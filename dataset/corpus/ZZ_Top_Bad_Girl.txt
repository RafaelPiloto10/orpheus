See that girl with the red dress on,  
She can do it all night long,  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
I know a girl that likes to flirt,  
She can do it in a mini skirt.  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,  
It's enough to drive you mad.  
  
Yesterday I was playin' it cool  
But she played me for a first class fool,  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
I'm gonna tell you like I told some friends  
I'm goin' back to dig her again.  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,  
It's enough to drive you mad.  
  
I know a girl with a GTO,  
She's the one that go cat go,  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
See the girl dressed in green,  
She's the one that's a mean machine,  
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl.  
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,  
It's enough to drive you mad.
