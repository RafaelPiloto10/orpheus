I was alright, for a while  
I could smile for a while  
But when I saw you last night  
You held my hand so tight  
As you stopped to say hello  
Oh, you wished me well  
And you couldn't tell  
That i'd been  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
When you said so long  
You left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying  
  
Crying  
Crying  
I'm crying  
It's hard to understand  
That the touch of your hand  
Could start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you  
But it's true, oh so true  
I love you even more  
Than I did before  
But darling, what can I do  
'cause you don't love me  
And I'll always be  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
And now that you're gone  
And from this moment on  
I'll be crying  
Crying  
Crying  
Crying  
I'm crying  
I'm crying  
Over you
