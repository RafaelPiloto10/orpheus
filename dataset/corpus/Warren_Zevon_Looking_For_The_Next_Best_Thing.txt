I worked hard, but not for the money  
Did my best to please  
I used to think it was funny  
'Til I realized it was just a tease  
Don Quixote had his windmills  
Ponce de Leon took his cruise  
Took Sinbad seven voyages  
To see that it was all a ruse  
(That's why I'm) Looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I appreciate the best  
But I'm settling for less  
'Cause I'm looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
All alone on the road to perfection  
At the inspection booth they tried to discourage me  
You can believe what you want--that'll never change it  
You'll have to come around eventually  
(And you'll be) Looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I appreciate the best  
But I'm settling for less  
'Cause I'm looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I'm looking for the next best thing
