Beyond the reef  
Where the sea is dark and cold,  
My love has gone,  
And our dreams grow old.  
There'll be no tears,  
There'll be no regretting.  
Will she remember me,  
Will she forget?  
I'll send a thousand flow'rs  
When the trade winds blow.  
I'll send my lonely heart,  
For i love her so.  
Someday i know  
She'll come back again to me.  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef  
  
Some day i know  
She'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef
