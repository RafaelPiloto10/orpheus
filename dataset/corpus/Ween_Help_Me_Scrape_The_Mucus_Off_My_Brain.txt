I guess it's somethin' in my brain  
I need whiskey to ease the pain  
But it's early in the mornin'  
And I'm feelin' bad again  
  
But if you ever loved me  
You'll go easy on me now  
Fix me up a cup of coffee  
And in a while I'll come around  
  
I think I spent the dog-food money  
But he'll love me just the same  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain  
  
It's a shame when morning hurts  
I've seen bad and I've seen worse  
It's the nature of my bein'  
I took some money from your purse  
  
N'that Frenchman loves to party  
And I know he's not to blame  
But the way you're lookin' at me baby  
I just can't help but feel the shame  
  
I think I spent the dog-food money  
But he'll love me just the same  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain  
  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain
