There's two things I know for sure,  
She was sent here from heaven,  
And she's daddy's little girl.  
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night,  
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes.  
And I thank God for all the joy in my life,  
But most of all, for...  
  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair.  
"Walk beside the pony daddy,  
Its my first ride."  
"I know the cake looks funny,  
Daddy, but I sure tried."  
Oh, with all that I've done wrong,  
I must have done something right  
To deserve a hug every morning  
And butterfly kisses at night.  
  
Sweet sixteen today,  
She's looking like her momma  
A little more every day.  
One part woman, the other part girl.  
To perfume and makeup,  
From ribbons and curls.  
Trying her wings out in a great  
Big world. But I remember...  
  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair.  
"You know how much I love you daddy,  
But if you don't mind,  
I'm only going to kiss you on  
The cheek this time."  
With all that I've done wrong,  
I must have done something right.  
To deserve her love every morning,  
And butterfly kisses at night.  
  
All the precious time  
Like the wind, the years go by  
Precious butterfly  
Spread your wings and fly  
  
She'll change her name today.  
She'll make a promise,  
And I'll give her away.  
Standing in the bride room  
Just staring at her,  
She asked me what I'm thinking,  
And I said "I'm not sure,  
I just feel like l'm losing my baby girl."  
Then she leaned over...and gave me...  
Butterfly kisses, with her mama there  
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair  
"Walk me down the aisle daddy, it's just about time"  
"Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?"  
"Daddy don't cry "  
Oh with all that I've done wrong, I must have  
Done something right  
To deserve her love every morning  
And butterfly kisses  
I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is  
What love is  
I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always remember  
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses for life...
