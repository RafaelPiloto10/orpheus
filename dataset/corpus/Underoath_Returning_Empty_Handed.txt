Speak of the years of growing weary..  
I'll take this to the end  
And watch the waves crash over me  
  
Speak of the years of growing weary  
I'll take this to the end  
And watch the waves crash over me  
  
I feel oh so over, come  
With enough, time  
To turn it all around  
And I'm picture perfect  
See the way, I've come  
A sick sicker, illustration  
My eyes roll back and focus, on what today  
I cant still stand if you leave the hand to praise me  
I'll take this on my own  
I'll take this on my own  
I'll take this on
