(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
  
The pain inside  
When you think you love another  
But can't decide which way to go  
And you're searching for a reason to leave his side  
In time you'll see  
It has to be this way  
And though it hurts to say  
I'm gonna be staying with my baby  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes, before you turn away  
You must know that I'll always love you  
But now, I'm staying with my baby  
  
You used to say  
I should maybe take it further  
And leave one day  
My family - but I'm responsible for them  
They depend on me  
So now you see, our love is history  
I'm sad it has to end  
But I'm gonna be staying with my baby  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes, before you turn away  
You must know that I'll always love you  
But now, I'm staying with my baby  
(I'm staying with my baby... yes I am)  
  
Please understand  
He's just a desperate man  
Who's doing all he can  
So I'm going back  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I'm gonna stay  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I'm gonna stay
