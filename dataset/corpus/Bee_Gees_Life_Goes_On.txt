Pardon me, if I use you in my dreams  
You throw those angel eyes at me  
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems  
But she is not in love with me  
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away  
A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are  
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her  
It's got to be growing  
I can't wait no longer  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Suddenly, all the world gets in the way  
You disappear into the crowd  
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud  
I want to know you , but I never met you  
Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong, only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Living your life in someone else's heart  
A lover's dream that has no end  
There may be somebody you can base your world upon  
I'll never be the same again  
And there's a part of me here  
And there's a part of me with you  
But all of me loves you  
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me  
I'm so proud of  
All of my days I will be here for you  
And the love keeps running  
And if I can't hold you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I
