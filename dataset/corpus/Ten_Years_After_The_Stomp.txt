All right, oh, yeah  
Come on, baby, yeah  
  
Hey baby, sure love you fine  
You got a way of moving, mama  
Make me lose my mind  
You know, mama, what you got  
Something I need, sure need a lot  
I got the rhythm, and you sure got the style  
So, shake it, mama, please stomp around a while  
Shake on  
  
Hey, baby, yes, you're doing fine  
You're stomping so good, mama  
You got the boys in the line  
Foxy mama  
You sure got what it takes  
And when you're stomping, darling  
Boy, it really shakes  
Foxy woman  
You don't tell no lies  
What you got, darling  
Sure would like to advertise  
Hear the boys say  
Look at that, mama, don't she look fine  
Love that woman, make her mine  
And you know, baby, that's where it's at  
Just stomp around, mama  
Shake it, shake it out  
Shake it, mama, oh, mama, mmm  
Shake it, mama  
Mmm, yeah, baby  
Mmm, oh, mama, yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
Do the stomp  
Stomp around
