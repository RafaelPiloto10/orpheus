Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, honey  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
I've got your picture hanging on the wall  
But it can't see or come to me  
When I call your name  
I realize it's just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters when you're not near  
But they don't move me  
They don't groove me like when I hear  
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
I play my games of fantasy  
I pretend but I'll know in reality  
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me  
  
No other sound is quite the same as your name  
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better  
So let's stay together  
  
I got some memories to look back on  
Though they help when you're gone, I'm well aware  
That nothing can take your place of you being there  
  
So glad we got the real thing, baby  
So glad we got the real thing, talk to me  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real  
Say it loud like you're proud  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, baby  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, we've got it  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, honey  
Ain't nothing like that real thing, baby
