Why do birds suddenly appear  
Every time you are near?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
Why do stars fall down from the sky  
Every time you walk by?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
On the day that you were born the angels got together  
And decided to create a dream come true  
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair  
Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue  
That is why all the girls in town  
(Girls in town)  
Follow you  
(Follow you)  
All around  
(All around)  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
On the day that you were born the angels got together  
And decided to create a dream come true  
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair  
Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue  
That is why all the girls in town  
(Girls in town)  
Follow you  
(Follow you)  
All around  
(All around)  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
(Why? Close to you)  
(Why? Close to you)  
(Haa, close to you)  
(Why? Close to you)
