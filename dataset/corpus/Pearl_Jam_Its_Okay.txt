It's okay, it's okay (x4)  
You don't have to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
I love you anyway  
It's okay, it's okay  
You don't need to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
This is my life, this is my chance  
This is my hope in an alleyway  
This is my choice, this is my voice  
There may be no tomorrow, now  
This is my plea, this is my need  
This is my day to be free  
This is my time, this is my way  
In a world that's never safe  
It's okay, it's okay  
You gotta let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
Oh now let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
You're gonna run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay
