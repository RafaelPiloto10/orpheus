Look in the mirror  
Does it look familiar  
Cannot put my finger  
Why he kinda looks like me  
  
Used to like hooking up with you  
After waking first thing I'd do  
One sided sensation  
Watching me watching you  
  
Now I'm stuck how I feel  
I don't know if it's real  
I'm trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
Now I'm stuck in the middle  
My life is the riddle  
Trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't know why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Just wants to be left there  
  
Living a constant lie  
How much longer  
I'd rather die  
So bitter  
Tongue twisted  
Has me paralyzed  
  
They claim they know me  
Who I'm supposed to be  
A quick fix sure remedy  
Another needly plunges deep  
  
Now I'm stuck how I feel  
I don't know if it's real  
I'm trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
Now I'm stuck in the middle  
My life is the riddle  
Trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't know why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Just wants to be left right there  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't care why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Wants to be left right there  
  
No way  
No way  
No way  
No way out  
No way  
No way  
No way  
No way out
