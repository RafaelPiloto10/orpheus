Well I love that Kewpie Doll  
Yeah I bought her in a show  
I dressed her up in a cheap red cotton dress  
But everything was either fished-out or spat out  
Fished out or spat out  
Well I love that kewpie doll  
But I could not make it stick  
Only she could save my soul  
She put her hands inside of me  
Well I love that kewpie-doll  
Dressed her in a cheap red cotton dress  
Fished it out now  
Spat it our now  
Spat it out in front of me  
Well I love that kewpie doll  
But I could not make it stick  
Doll doll doll doll  
I held her in my cheap arms  
She believed in me her soul plus my arms  
Well I love that kewpie doll  
I told her phony storys  
I love that kewpie doll  
She believed in me  
Doll doll dolll doll  
Cupie on a stick  
I can see her coming even now  
Kupie on a stick  
I can see her walking to me even now  
Well I love that kewpie-doll  
But I could not make it stick
