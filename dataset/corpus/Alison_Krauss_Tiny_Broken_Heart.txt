He was just a little farm lad, so busy at play  
With his little playmate outside the gate  
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door  
At the home of his tiny playmate  
Then he saw his daddy watching too  
As the men swiftly walked to the cottage door  
He knew they were strangers that came from the town  
Men he had never seen before  
They soon went to work when he heard his daddy say  
?Our neighbors are moving today?  
?Oh no!? he cried, ?Dear God don't let it be  
They can't take my sweetheart away?  
I know dad, you don't understand  
How a heart so young could conceive a plan  
I'm only seven now but it's just like you say  
Daddy, someday I'll be a man  
The man who owns the farm where your playmates do live  
He told me it'd have to be this way  
For winter time has come and the work is all done  
That's why they are moving today  
Let us buy the farm so they can stay  
And give them all the toys that dear Santa gave  
And give them all my pennies in my little piggy bank  
Pennies that my darlin' help me save
