Why don't you ever get the point  
You're much too slow for me  
Why don't we ever flip our coin  
Reliability  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
They call us crazy early birds  
Too early never hurts  
Warmth is not as dangerous as  
As dangerous as those words  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
  
Winter never gets me down  
It's just a feeling  
Feeling fine  
To care for you or not to care  
A god damned thin thin line  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
We've got to sing  
  
Why don't you ever get the point  
You're much too slow for me  
Why don't we ever flip our coin  
Probably a lack of reliability  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
We've got to sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long
