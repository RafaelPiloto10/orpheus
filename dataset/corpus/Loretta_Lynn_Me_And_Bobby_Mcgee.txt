La la la la la la (Bobby Mcgee) La la la la la la (Bobby Mcgee)  
La la la la la la (Bobby Mcgee) La la la la la la me and Bobby Mcgee  
  
Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin' for the trains feelin' nearly faded as my
jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New
Orleans  
I pulled my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana  
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With those windshield whipers slappin' time I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine  
We sang every song that driver knew  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free  
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby Mcgee  
La la la la la la (Bobby Mcgee)...  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done  
Every night he kept me from the cold  
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let him slip away  
Searching for the home I hope he'll find  
And I'd give all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine  
Freedom's just another word...  
La la la la la la (Bobby Mcgee)...
