I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night  
But my arms come up empty every time  
And lately I talk to your memory  
More than I should  
If I could just forget the past I would  
Cause this missing you ain't doing me no good  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so close to crazy  
Right on the edge  
Just one step away from going insane  
But I'm not there yet  
If I could just lose my mind  
I wouldn't know we're through  
But this close to crazy  
Is far from over you  
  
Today I caught myself  
Reliving how it used to be  
At a table for two just you and me  
But talking to an empty chair  
And laughing right out loud  
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt  
I'm a broken woman close to breaking down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night
