Last night I said to her  
I didn't want to live inside a lie  
If she wants him more than she wants me  
Let this be  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back  
All day I wait and wait  
To hear her footsteps on my walkway  
She never came  
She never even called  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back  
Somehow I know it won't last  
Somehow I know it won't last too long  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back
