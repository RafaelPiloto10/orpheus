Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine  
There's somethin' special on my mind  
Last night I met a new guy in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah,  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
He's the kind of guy who's not too shy  
And I can tell he's my kind of guy.  
He danced close to me like I hoped he would, whoa yeah,  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
We only danced for a minute or two,  
He stuck to me the whole night through.  
Last night we fell in love,  
He's everything I'm dreamin' of.  
  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
We only danced for a minute or two,  
He stuck to me the whole night through.  
Last night we fell in love,  
He's everything I'm dreamin' of...  
  
He walked me home and I held his hand  
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand  
So I asked to see him again and he said I could.  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good,  
Something good, whoa yeah, something good  
Something good, whoa yeah, something good
