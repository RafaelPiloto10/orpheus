The time has come to part, my love  
I must go away  
I leave you now, my darling girl  
No longer can I stay  
  
My heart like yours is breaking  
Together we'll prove strong  
The road I take will show the world  
The suffering that goes on  
  
The gentle clasp that holds my hand  
Must loosen and let go  
Please help me through the door  
Though instinct tells you no  
  
Our vow it is eternal  
And will bring you dreadful pain  
But if our demands aren't recognized  
Don't call me back again  
  
How their sorrow touched us all  
In those final days  
When it was the time she held the door  
And touched his sallow face  
  
The flame he lit by leaving  
Is still burning strong  
By the lights it's plain to see  
The suffering still goes on  
  
The time has come to part, my love  
I must go away  
I leave you now, my darling girl  
No longer can I stay
