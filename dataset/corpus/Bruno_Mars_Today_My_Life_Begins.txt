I've been working hard so long  
Seems like pain has been my only friend  
My fragile heart's been done so wrong  
I wondered if I'd ever heal again  
  
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same  
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin'  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Yesterday has come and gone  
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is  
And I see that I was wrong  
For ever doubting I could win  
  
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same  
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Life's too short to have regrets  
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget  
Only have one life to live  
So you better make the best of it  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
Today my life begins...
