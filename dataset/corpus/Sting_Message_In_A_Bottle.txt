Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh  
Another lonely day, with no one here but me, oh  
More loneliness than any man could bear  
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
A year has passed since I wrote my note  
But I should have known this right from the start  
Only hope can keep me together  
Love can mend your life but  
Love can break your heart  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
Walked out this morning, don't believe what I saw  
Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore  
Seems I'm not alone at being alone  
Hundred billion castaways, looking for a home  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s...
