I recall a friend of mine  
With a tear in my eye  
I stand here at the altar  
He's out  
I'm left with a problem now  
I'm here on earth left with the pain  
Look what you've done  
You should have called  
  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
  
Sorry I couldn't help  
Take it back  
Sorry I didn't help  
Well fuck you, you could have called  
What about us what about me  
What about the years I spend pampering your ass  
Running here running there  
"Oh I'm so great, I'm so great,  
I'm fine, I'm fine"  
You lied  
You promised to give your family a break  
From your blows  
Look at the sad faces you've left behind now  
I let you down?  
No you let me down  
I got a family to feed  
You got a little kid yourself  
You know what I mean?  
You were supposed to stay  
No one gave you the right to take your life that way  
  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
  
Halle halle halle  
Halle halle hallelujah  
  
I feel hate, I feel pain  
I feel cold I feel ashamed  
Where's the father you should have been to your daughter?  
Sad news, sad days  
Where are you now?  
Talk to me come on talk to me  
I know you can hear me  
Why brother why?  
  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win, tails you loose  
  
Halle halle halle  
Halle halle hallelujah  
  
You could have gone a different way
