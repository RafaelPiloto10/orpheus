She's calling up her old boyfriends  
I'm falling in love with her again  
She's looking for a change of pace,she says  
I can see that old look on her face  
She says it takes an open mind  
I think she means an open relationship  
She says I can be so unkind  
All I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
She says it isn't wrong or right  
And me, I'm emotionally colourblind  
She's waking me at half past four  
I'm sleeping on the bathroom floor again  
She's fallen for his new age verse  
I'm holding back a level of consciousness  
I know it isn't wrong or right  
But all I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
I ran into an old girlfriend  
On the corner of Varrick and VanDam  
She said she had to change her address  
What a strange coincidence...
