Water the plants, feed the cat  
Leave that door key under the mat  
I'm your number one from now on  
Set the code, close the door  
You don't live there anymore  
I'm your number one from now on  
Nothing grows so quickly as the vine  
That wraps you up so tight and says 'You're mine'  
No time so exciting as the time  
You pour away that bottle containing last night's wine  
Last night's wine, last night's wine  
What you're taking part in is the cleverest of crimes  
Last night's wine, just a flickering sign  
But a necessary sin from time to time  
Fold your dress, leave your hair  
Put on your jeans, you ain't goin' nowhere  
I'm your number one from now on  
Cancel the milk, unplug the phone  
Close the blinds, you ain't gonna be home  
I'm your number one from now on  
No time quite so easy as the night  
To hold her far too close or far too tight  
No catch quite so keen, so quick to bite  
Than the one that thinks love's possible first or second sight  
Love at first sight, love at first sight  
Swinging from the chandelier, it's a one way ticket flight  
Love at first sight, so wrong it's right  
Swing you by your pigtails, set your world alight  
Nothing hooks you quicker than the line  
Thrown straight and from the bank into your spine  
For family and for friends you'll surely pine  
But sentiment and nostalgia, they just ain't worth a dime  
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?  
You can leave those financial worries well behind  
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?  
I don't want that bank manager on your pretty little mind  
Now that you're mine
