Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry  
I found you wanting  
Like everyone  
Always trying  
Happy lying  
'cause I'm no stranger  
To the ways of the world  
I felt like crying  
I felt like dying  
We took a coffee  
You took it so strong  
Shaded from the neon  
I could still see your eyes  
  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
  
Found in the gutter  
With a knife in her back  
Letter said sorry  
Please don't worry  
  
She had a lover  
With danger in his eyes  
I tried to tell her  
But she had the wildest heart  
  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh Cherry  
  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how
