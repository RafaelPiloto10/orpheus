Sweet 16 in leather boots  
Body and soul,  
I go crazy  
Baby, baby I'm a hungry,  
sweet 16  
  
Funky bar all full of faces  
Pretty faces, beautiful faces  
Body and soul, body and soul I give to you  
I am an easy mark with my broken heart  
Sweet 16  
  
Show you my explosion, sweet 16  
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt, crying inside  
'Cause everybody's so fine  
And they don't need me.  
  
Tell me what can I do, sweet 16  
I give you my body and soul sweet 16  
I must be hungry 'cause I go crazy  
Over your leather boots  
Now baby I know  
  
That's not normal  
But I love you,  
I love you  
I love you, sweet 16  
(Everywhere I go, I love it!)
