Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind  
But now  
I see  
I see  
I see  
Through many dangers  
Toils and snares I have already come  
't Is grace that brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
Me home  
't Was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believe  
Believe  
When we've been there  
Ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've now less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun  
Begun  
Begun, begun  
Amazing grace  
Amazing grace
