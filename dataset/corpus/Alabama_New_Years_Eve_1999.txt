Baby, let's make a date for a night on the town  
How does the turn of the century sound  
I guarantee that we'll have a good time  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
Now I know it sounds a bit premature  
But I'm askin' you now 'cause I want to be sure  
Do you have anything else in mind  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
We'll drink pink champagne from a plastic cup  
Dance all night 'til the sun comes up  
We'll say it's been a pretty good century  
Except for that weekend in '93  
  
Then we'll go home to our warn winter bed  
And tuck in the kids with a kiss on the head  
And sing one more chorus of Auld Lang Syne  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
I'll be your sweetheart if you'll be mine  
New Year's Eve 1999, New Year's Eve 1999
