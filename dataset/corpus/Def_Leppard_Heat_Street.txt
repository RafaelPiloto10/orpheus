What can I hear? Who can I see?  
What's this I fear that's followin' me?  
It's getting louder, it's coming near  
I can not stand it, I'm gettin' outta here  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
The rain is falling around my feet  
The night is calling on this well-lit street  
People in doorways just stand and stare  
Castaway shadows that really aren't there  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
What can I hear? Who can I see?  
What's this I fear that's followin' me?  
It's getting louder, it's coming near  
I can not stand it, I'm getting outta here  
  
You'd better beware now  
Yeah you'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
You'll never be a winner  
On heat street
