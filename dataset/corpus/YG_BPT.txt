Nigga I'm from BPT  
West Side, West Side  
TTP, one block, one block  
400, Spruce Street  
What y'all doing?  
Nigga kill off all beef  
  
I'm a West Side with rackn', in the back whats happenin'  
40 Glock, snap a Insta, ain't no need for no caption  
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage  
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it  
Homie threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!  
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest  
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect  
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect, woo!  
That's how I got put on  
Tree Top Piru, yeah I got put on  
It was hard in the hood  
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood  
I know Game from cedar block, Dom from the West  
That was [?] and Pac, what's his name and his chest  
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on  
Niggas gotta go, we can't hold on

I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'  
'Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence  
That's a principle of proof, the definition of logic  
That this nigga is a bitch  
Every chance he get, he dogdin'  
Brought back this West Coast shit and this the motherfuckin' thanks I get  
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit  
They brought him more cases in jail, but a nigga ain't snitch  
That's how it's s'posed to go down  
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down  
You a blind date, have my bitch pick you up  
Then have one of my top members stick you up  
I know Nipsey from 60-0, C-Hood from 10-4  
Tony Bone from 40 Crips, that's my kinfolk  
My whole family tried to set me but it didn't work  
Momma know I been bangin' lately nigga
