Who, oh Lord, could save themselves  
Their own soul could heal?  
Our shame was deeper than the sea  
Your grace is deeper still (x2)  
  
Chorus:  
You alone can rescue  
You alone can save  
You alone can lift us from the grave  
You came down to find us  
Led us out of death  
To You alone belongs the highest praise  
(To You alone belongs the highest praise x2)  
  
You, oh Lord, have made a way  
The great divide You heal  
For when our hearts were far away  
Your love went further still  
Yes, Your love goes further still  
  
Bridge:  
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes  
You're the Giver of Life  
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes  
You're the Giver of Life (x4)
