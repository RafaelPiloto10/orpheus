I cannot stop this child from touching me  
I see not fault in watching her bloom  
She knows where fire begins and where sparks might fly  
Yet I feel she may be consumed.  
She done turns on the be stage  
She shook hands when the shoe fit  
I wanna know how the land lies  
I'll let you in on a secret.  
I did not steal away when love rode by  
I did not let myself be unkind  
It's so heard to say where love meets lust  
I often think I'm losing my mind.  
I trade notes with the press league  
They send back their suggestions  
I wanna know where I come from  
But all I get are directions.  
Chorus  
I can't get started, can't get pain  
What's wrong?  
Big ideas, the find intentions  
They're all gone  
It takes two flagons of courage  
Pounds, shillings and pence  
You wind up going nowhere  
It doesn't make sense.  
I see my brother's face grow dark with care  
I spend my time avoiding his gaze  
I pray that God might make his dreams come true  
I'd give so much to feel he's been saved.  
A bright spark in the playground  
Dead loss as an anchor  
You don't call him a misfit  
He's just stuck for an answer.  
Chorus (2)
