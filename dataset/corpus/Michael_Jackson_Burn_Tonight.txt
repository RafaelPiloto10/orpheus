Girl  
We used to be one  
I was the moon and you were my sun  
And oh  
We used to love once  
Till you deserted me to hunt down more lunch  
  
But you  
Can't fool me  
I know exactly whatcha doing  
And you  
Can't burn me, cause I flicked you into your doom  
  
But still you're trying to burn me  
But it just isn't working!  
  
You make us burn  
We can make this burn  
  
You make us burn  
Together we will burn!  
  
Oh, girl I wanna testify, ooh come on and let me light the fire, we can  
Make it work tonight, rain and thunder when you burn 2 night  
  
Oh, girl I want to break your cries, ooh come on and watch you fire die, we  
Can make it work tonight, rain and thunder when you burn 2 night
