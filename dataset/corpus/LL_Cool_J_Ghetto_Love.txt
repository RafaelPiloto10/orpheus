Damn I Miss You  
It's still gone ride, it's still gone ride  
Uh uh, uh uh, c'mon, uh, uh, yeah, ride, uh  
  
Damn I miss you  
Ooh I feel better than before  
We should've never separated  
Paused or hesitated  
You rocked me to sleep  
It's like my body levitated  
Looking in the mirror  
But the heat makes it less clearer  
It's all fogged up, face me baby  
Put your fingers in my mouth, let me taste the gravy  
Reunited, feel good, real good, squeeze me  
I tell you that I Love You  
But you wouldn't believe me  
  
[Chorus: Mashonda]  
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you  
Anything you want I will do  
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you  
Anything you want I will do  
  
[Mashonda]  
Hello  
Baby  
There is something that I want to say to you  
You've been on my mind now  
For a while and I just don't know what to do  
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Mashonda]  
I know  
That we've  
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past  
If you promise to hold me down  
Then our love will have a second chance to last  
I've been thinking of holding you  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[LL Cool J]  
Forget the past  
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on  
Back to back, through the ups and downs  
Right or wrongs, lay down  
Let me kiss you all down your back  
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around  
I apologize too  
For not recognizing the pain inside of you  
I never lie to you, again  
Last time had stress on my mind  
Had a hard time believing  
That my girl could be genuine  
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real  
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel  
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most  
From now on, til we give up the ghost  
Reunited, Baby  
  
[Chorus]
