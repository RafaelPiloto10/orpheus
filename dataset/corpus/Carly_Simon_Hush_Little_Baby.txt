Hush, little baby, don't say a word.  
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird  
  
And if that mockingbird won't sing,  
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring  
  
And if that diamond ring turns brass,  
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat  
  
And if that billy goat won't pull,  
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull  
  
And if that cart and bull fall down,  
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town
