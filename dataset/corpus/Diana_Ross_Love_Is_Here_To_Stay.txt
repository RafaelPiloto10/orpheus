It's very clear  
Our love is here to stay  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day  
  
The radio  
And the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
Together we're  
Going a long, long way  
  
In time the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay but  
Our love is here to stay  
  
The radio  
And the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
Together we're  
Going a long, long way  
  
In time the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay but  
Our love is here to  
Our love is here to  
Our love is here to stay
