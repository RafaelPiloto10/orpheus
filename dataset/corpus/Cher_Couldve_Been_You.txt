Well it must have been good  
'Cause you said it was love  
I guess the day you left me  
It wasn't good enough  
Now you're calling my number  
Say you want to come back  
Oh baby, baby  
It's too late for that  
'Cause when you see me, there'll be somebody new by my side  
Somebody who is sure he is mine  
  
[Chorus]  
When you see the smile on his face  
Just remember, baby  
Could've been you, could've been you  
When he's standing there in your place  
I hate to say it, baby  
Could've been you  
  
Guess I should've been cool  
Maybe I was too kind  
When loving me was easy  
You were hard to find  
When I cried over you, baby  
How the teardrops burned  
Oh baby, baby  
Now the table's turned  
So if those tears start falling when you see us walking by  
I hope you won't forget who said goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Should've been you, but you threw it all away  
Could've been you, standing here today  
So if those tears start falling when you see us walking by  
I hope you won't forget who said goodbye  
You said goodbye  
  
[Chorus x 2]
