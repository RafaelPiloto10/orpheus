Picked up the paper  
Flip through the pages  
Reach for my coffee cup  
Yes, I'm still waking up  
Late in the day now  
What can I say now?  
Some folks are morning people  
I never was one of those  
  
[Chorus]  
All the same  
I get in the game  
Give me muddy, muddy water  
Now I'm feeling better  
  
You know whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now  
  
Vodka and tonic, a touch of the chronic  
I'd trade my days for nights  
I love the city lights  
None of your business  
Who I might sleep with  
Some things are bad for me  
And some things I just can't resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know, whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now  
  
I'm feeling so free-wheeling  
But it's so hard to maintain  
Fascinate me, medicate me  
Cause I can't get over the pain  
  
Picked up the paper  
Flipped through the pages  
Coffee and cigarettes  
Turn on the TV set  
Night time is falling  
People are calling  
I love to watch them run  
Round and round and round  
  
You know, whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now
