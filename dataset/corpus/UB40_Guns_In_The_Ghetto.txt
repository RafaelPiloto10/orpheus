Daddy don't go out tonight  
Just stay home till morning light  
Me and mama don't feel right  
Please hold us tight  
Daddy why did you go to work  
When you know just how much we love you so  
Please come back tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
They're giving out guns in the ghetto  
They're saying they will set you free  
One day I'll have children of my own  
But I'm afraid they won't have me  
  
Mama, is Daddy home  
Why are you crying all alone  
Grandma's tears have turned to stone  
And I'm all alone  
  
Mama isn't daddy back  
I'm getting scared and that's a fact  
Why are we all dressed like that  
All in black  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Daddy don't go out tonight  
Please stay home till morning light  
Me and mama don't feel right  
Please hold us tight  
  
Daddy why did you go to work  
When you know just how much we love you so  
Please come back tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama, is Daddy home  
Why are you crying all alone  
Grandma's tears have turned to stone  
And I'm chilled to the bone  
  
Mama isn't daddy back  
I'm getting scared and that's a fact  
Why are we all dressed like that  
All in black  
  
[Chorus: x4]
