Mao Mao Mao...  
  
I love the sound of smashing guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Red guitars against the wall  
Big guitars can turn so small  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Show it!  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
I love the sound of breaking guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Hey you long haired vintage Jesus  
Break the guitar into 1000 pieces  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Don't you?  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
Don't you love the sound of crashing guitars?  
Don't you love the sound of crashing electric guitars?  
Don't you love that sound, drivin' in your car  
Don't you love the sound of crashing electric guitars?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
  
I love the touch of watching the stars  
I love the sound of trashing guitars  
Custom made, Townshend's ace  
Smash the axe and break the case  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Crashing and crashing!  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Mao Mao Mao...
