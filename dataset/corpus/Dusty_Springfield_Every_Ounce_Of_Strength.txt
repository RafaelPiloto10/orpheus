I'll put your pictures all around my wall  
I'll build a tower of love that won't fall  
I'll do everything I can  
I'll try to be your own lovin' woman  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Oh, there is nothing that I wouldn't do  
To let the world know  
I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
I'd use all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
Every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
  
You can ask for what you want  
And a-get what you ask  
I'd give my all to make  
I would love for ever last  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Long as blood runs through my veins  
Long as I can see clouds that bring on rain  
I'll use a-all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every, every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every
