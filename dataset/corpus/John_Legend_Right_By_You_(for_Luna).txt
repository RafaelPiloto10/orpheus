[Verse 1]  
Will you live like me, in a world run by desire?  
Will you wake from worldly dream and not be tired?  
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?  
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire?  
How can you be free from all this sorrow?  
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
And if angels don't have answers to your prayers  
Oh, I will be there, oh I will be there  
  
[Verse 2]  
And if who you love don't want your love, well then...  
Do you cut a deal with love and run again?  
You see, love contains the meaning of despair  
Will you think like me? Will you have your mother's fire?  
Maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired  
Will we do right by you? Will we you have what you require  
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire?  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Can you choose to lead if no one follows?  
And if we fell today, must you tomorrow?  
Sanctify your answer not your prayer  
Oh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there  
Yeah, I will be there  
  
[Outro]  
And even when it all becomes too much  
When you're growing old and feeling out of touch  
Listen to this song and just take care  
And know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there  
No, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will  
Little girl, I'm cryin'
