All wound up  
On the edge  
Terrified  
Sleep disturbed  
Restless mind  
Petrified  
Clouds of fear  
Permeate  
All I see  
Heightening  
Nervousness  
Threatens me  
  
I am paralyzed  
So afraid to die  
  
Cut of cord  
Warning signs  
Never show  
Tension strikes  
Jokingly  
Worries grow  
  
Why do I feel so numb  
Is it something to do with where I come from  
Should this be fight or flight  
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight  
  
Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest  
Agitated body in distress  
I feel like I'm in danger  
Daily life is strangled by my stress  
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins  
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane  
  
No strong hope for redemption  
A grave situation desperate at best  
  
Why do I feel so numb  
Is it something to do with where I come from  
Should this be fight or flight  
I don't know why I'm constantly feeling...  
  
Helpless hysteria  
A false sense of urgency  
Trapped in my phobia  
Possessed by anxiety  
  
Run, try to hide  
Overwhelmed by this  
Conflicts delirium  
  
Helpless hysteria  
A false sense of urgency  
Trapped in my phobia  
Possessed by anxiety  
  
Run, try to hide  
Overwhelmed by this  
Conflicts delirium
