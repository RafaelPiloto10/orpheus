How old d'you say your sister was? (sister was, sister was)  
You know you'd better keep an eye on her (eye on her, eye on her)  
Do the ronde ronde ronde do the rond rond  
She hangs out  
She hangs out  
  
I heard you taught your sister the bugaloo (bugaloo, bugaloo)  
I heard you taught your sister the shigaling too (shigaling too, shigaling

Well, she can teach you a thing or two (a thing or two, thing or two)  
Do the ronde ronde ronde do the rond rond  
She hangs out  
She hangs out  
  
Well, she hangs out, hangs out  
every night, every night  
You know you best get down here on the double  
Before she gets her pretty little self in trouble  
She's, so fine, so fine
