Well, I once knew a man who was going insane  
He let love chase him right up a tree  
It took the police and a fire truck just to bring him back down  
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me  
It made the front page of the paper, the gossip tongues wagged  
Why they even showed it all on TV  
Now if he should live forever, he won't live it down  
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me  
Dog bites man, man loses girl  
Oh, what did he ever do wrong in this world?  
Dog bites man, man loses girl  
Oh, what have I every done wrong in this world?  
There once was a big buzz all over town  
About a movie where the killer goes free  
Now, he's got everyone's sympathy  
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me  
Yes, I hate it when that happens to me
