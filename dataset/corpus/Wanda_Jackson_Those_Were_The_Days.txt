Once upon a time,  
There was a tavern where we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And think of all the great things we would do  
  
Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance, I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another and we'd say  
Those were the days my friend, we thought they'd never end  
  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we chose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la lay  
  
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days  
Just tonight, I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Oh was that lonely woman really me  
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh my friend we're older, but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  
Those were the days...
