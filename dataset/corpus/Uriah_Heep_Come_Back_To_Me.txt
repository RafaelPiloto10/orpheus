Alone again, I feel so alone again  
With this emptiness I just can't hide  
Picture me with a broken heart  
See the tears run down my face  
  
Everything I had has gone  
Everything is gone  
Loneliness still lingering on  
Everything I thought was mine  
Come back to me  
Can't we try it one more time  
Come back to me  
  
I know I'll find another love in time  
But you'll always be there  
In the back of my mind  
The power of love  
Can bring such pain  
I still love you, I just love you  
  
Alone again, I'm so alone again  
With nothing but you on my mind  
Can't you see  
What you've done to my life  
What can I do to  
Win you back again
