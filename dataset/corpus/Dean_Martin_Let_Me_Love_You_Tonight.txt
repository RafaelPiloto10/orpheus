Let me love you tonight  
Let me tell you how much I adore all your charms  
Though you leave me tomorrow for this night we'll borrow a love song  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me thrill to the touch of your sheltering arms  
Til the scent of the roses caresses and closes your eyes  
Let me kiss you tonight  
While the stars in the sky give a heavenly light  
So when love is an ember my heart will remember this sight  
Live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight  
Then forget me darling only  
Let me love you tonight  
Live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight  
Then forget me darling only  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight  
Let me love you tonight
