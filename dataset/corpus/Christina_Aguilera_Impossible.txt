It's impossible,  
It's impossible to love you  
If you don't, let me know, what you're feeling  
It's impossible, for me to give you what you need  
If you're always hidin it from me  
I don't know what hurts you  
I just, I want to make it right  
'Cause boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind  
  
'Cause it's impossible  
Oh, baby it's impossible  
For me to love you, this way  
It's impossible  
Oh baby it's impossible  
If you're making it this way  
(if you keep treating me this way  
Over, and over)  
  
Impossible to make it easy  
If you're always trying to make it so damn hard  
How can I, how can I, give you all my love baby  
If you're always, always putting up your guard  
This is not a circus  
Don't ya play me for a clown  
How long can emotions keep on going up and down  
  
'Cause it's impossible  
Oh, baby it's impossible  
For me to love you, this way  
It's impossible  
Oh baby it's impossible  
If you're making it this way  
(if you keep treating me this way  
Over, and over)
