After the sun goes down in the evening  
That's when your leaving hurts me most  
The times when you would nestle to me  
And dwell within my heart so cold  
Although you stand two steps away now  
The distance seems from coast to coast  
  
I often think of when I met you  
Many times we kissed goodbye  
Sometimes I dream we are together  
Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes  
And I wanna scream that I still love you  
But you're not there, I got to realize  
  
It is now High Noon in China  
With the same stars up above  
The one I need has left me and gone now  
And all I have is a little picutre of  
The truest one I've ever known now  
Is the love I lost and still I love
