I'm a Lady's Man, Oh! yes-sir-ee  
I like the gals and the gals like me  
Can I make 'em swoon? Oh! yes, I can  
Don't know what it is about me they love  
But what it is, I got plenty of  
Make way for me, I'm a lovin', Lady's Man.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man and that's no crime  
I like 'em 'round me all of the time  
I've got a line of talk they understand  
Now you may like a baseball game  
But as for me, that's much too tame  
I get my thrill just bein' a Lady's Man.  
  
Been a Lady's Man since I was three  
The women used to bounce me on their knee  
They would always say, "When he grows up, watch out!"  
"When the gals see his big blue eyes  
They'll hang around like a bunch of flies."  
Those women knew what they were talkin' about.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man I get the breaks  
I guess I've got everything it takes  
When it come to lovin', they like my brand  
Oh! the gals won't leave me alone  
I have to disconnect my phone  
That's how it is when you're a Lady's Man.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man, Oh! yes-sir-ee  
I love the gals and the gals love me  
And when it comes to dates, I'm in demand  
Oh! I like 'em short, I like 'em tall  
As a mater of fact, I love 'em all  
Make way for me, I'm a lovin', Lady's Man
