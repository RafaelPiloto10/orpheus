Build your dreams  
To the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
Play with fire till your fingers burn  
But when there's no place for you to turn  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
For when you hear a call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart I know  
I've been through it all and I'm an old pro  
And I'll understand if you go  
  
So make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need a little more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
(Piano solo)  
  
So? Make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me
