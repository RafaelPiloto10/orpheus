My world was no more than a dream  
And waitin' on a dream can sure get lonely  
Your love just fell right into place  
And filled and empty space to overflowing, overflowing  
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just don't know what I'd do  
'Cause my world begins and ends with you  
Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me  
But you know lying's not my style  
I just need your smile coming to me  
Reassuring me  
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just don't know what I'd do  
'Cause my world begins and ends with you
