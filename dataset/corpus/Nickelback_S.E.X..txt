"No" is a dirty word ,  
Never gonna say it first,  
"No" is just a thought that never crosses my mind.  
Maybe in the parking lot,  
Better bring your friend along,  
Better all together than just one at a time.  
  
[Chorus]  
S is for the simple need.  
E is for the ecstasy.  
X is just to mark the spot,  
Cause that's the one you really want.  
(Yes) sex is always the answer, it's never a question,  
Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's (yes)  
Not just a suggestion, if you ask the question,  
Then it's always yes, yeah!  
  
I'm loving what you wanna wear,  
I wonder what's up under there?  
Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?  
I love to try to set you free,  
I love you all over me.  
Love to hear the sound you make the second you're done.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Yes) sex is always the answer, it's never a question,  
Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's (Yes).  
Not just a suggestion, if you ask the question,  
Then it's always yes, yeah, (yes)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Yes!
