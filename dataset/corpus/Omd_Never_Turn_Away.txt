Save it for the next time  
Hands over my head  
Faintest sound of lightning  
Faintest sound I heard  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
  
All around my body  
All around my feet  
Please they are watching now  
Placed around my feet  
  
All around my body  
Please they are watching now  
  
Save it for the next time  
Hands over my head  
Faintest sound of lightning  
Faintest sound I heard  
  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
  
All around my body  
Please they are watching now
