There are nights  
When I can't help but cry  
And I wonder why you have to leave me  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
  
Chorus  
Tell me where did I go wrong?  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought  
This love would never end  
But if this love's not ours to have  
I'll let it go  
With your goodbye  
  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Tell me where did I go wrong?  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely?  
When I thought  
This love would never end  
But if this love's not ours to have  
I'll let it go with your goodbye...
