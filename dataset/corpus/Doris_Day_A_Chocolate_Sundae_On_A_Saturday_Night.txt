A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night  
What a way to make an evenin' end right  
The moo-oon was fine, the dancin' divine  
Let's head for the drug store at Maple and Vine  
  
Couples swayin' to a nickel machine  
There's a corner where we'll never be seen  
It's lovely to share that lover's delight  
A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night  
  
Now you can get most any flavor that you choose  
There's vanilla, that'll thrill ya, down to your shoes  
There's pistachio, and lemon pie  
They've got a special sundae with a cherry on top  
  
Lover's Lane, it just won't do  
For real sweet romance lead me to
