It doesn't seem so long ago  
That I was sitting at the edge of the desk  
And now I'm looking back with a smile  
As I turn my back to success  
And I laugh and I cry and ask myself why  
Everyday they do the same  
And I stop and I think for a minute each week  
Do they always catch the train  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
It seems like only yesterday  
That I was sitting at the edge of the desk  
And now I'm looking back with a smile  
As I turn my back to success  
And I laugh and I cry and ask myself why  
Everyday they do the same  
And I stop and I think for a minute each week  
Do they always catch the train  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same
