Pack it up, pack it in  
Let me begin, I came to win  
Battle me that's a sin  
I won't tear the sack up, punk you'd better back up  
Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up  
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up  
If you've got the feeling jump up touch the ceiling  
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk  
Yo, I'll bust 'em in the eye, and then I'll take the punks ho  
Feel it, funk it, amps in the trunk y'all  
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are Dunkin' Donuts shop  
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops  
  
[Chorus]  
I came to get down, I came to get down  
So get out your seats and jump around  
Jump around  
Jump around  
Jump around  
Jump up, jump up and get down  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
Jump  
  
I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe  
If your girl steps up, I'm smackin' the ho  
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs  
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms  
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned  
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned  
'Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none  
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun (shotgun)  
But if you do you're a fool 'cause I duel to the death  
Try and step to me you'll take your last breath  
I gots the skill, come get your bill  
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top  
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop  
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger  
Try and play me out like as if my name was Sega  
But I ain't goin' out like no punk bitch  
Get used to one style and you know I might switch  
It up up and around, then buck buck you down  
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead  
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya  
Spittin' out lyrics homie I want ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x33]  
Jump
