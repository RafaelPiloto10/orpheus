Love makes you blind, my baby too blind to see  
He's playing tricks, with you and me  
He's telling lies, oh don't believe this guy, oh no  
Your heart is broken, he says goodbye  
I swear you I love you it's hard to ignore  
This guy playing tricks with you baby  
Oh I will love you more and more  
Baby come in my arms  
  
Oh baby, fight for the right love  
Baby fight for your heart  
Nothing in the world oh will break us apart  
Baby fight for the right love  
Baby fight for your life  
Nothing changes only the strong survive  
Baby fight for your love  
Fight for your love  
  
If walls could speak, they will telling you  
He will forget you, he'll makes you blue  
My tears don't lie, baby if your're mine, oh no  
I'm painting all your clouds, with sunshine  
I swear you I love you I never let you go  
I'll never playing tricks with you baby  
And every day it's more than you know  
Baby come in my arms  
  
Fight for your right love  
Fight for the right heart  
I know it baby, what your're dreaming of  
Oh fight for your love, fight for your heart  
Baby, don't break apart
