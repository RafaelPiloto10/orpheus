(Original by The Turtles - written by Warron Zevon )  
  
You can try to please me  
But it won't be easy  
Stone walls surround me  
I'm surprised that you even found me  
Chorus:  
And you don't stand an outside chance  
(you don't stand an outside chance)  
You don't stand an outside chance  
But you can try  
Whatever you do girl  
You know you can't get through girl  
Can't bring me down  
Hang me up or even hang around  
[repeat chorus]  
I know you think you'll get me  
I'm only flesh and bone  
But you may as well forget me  
'Cause my heart is stone  
You better leave me alone  
Stand an outside chance
