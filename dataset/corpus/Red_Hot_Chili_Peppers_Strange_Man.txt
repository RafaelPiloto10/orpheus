All of my love and  
Most of my fears  
Been coming on strong  
For most of my years  
Add up and end up in a song  
  
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams  
Are blocking my shots and killin' my dreams  
That showed me how to be the cause  
  
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, hey ah what now?  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time, for me, I see  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah  
  
All of my friends and enemies  
They were part of this dance  
That put me right here we go  
So glad I got this chance  
  
Better known plans  
And lesser known schemes  
Were all about love and less about me  
I'd have to say she wore the pants  
  
That's oh!  
  
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time for me, Uh-hu  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
Woo! Yeah  
Ahh  
Go  
Oh  
I've been left  
(Can't figure out what he says next)  
(And then a bunch of scat)  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time, for me, lets see  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's me  
It's a long time, for me, uh-uh  
She wants to be rich and, I want to be free  
Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no, guarantee
