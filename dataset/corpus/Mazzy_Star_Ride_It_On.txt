Ride it on baby,  
Into my view  
Ride it on baby,  
Into your side  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you used to do  
Did you want me to love you, well,  
I'm just here for the call  
And you said that you're so low, well,  
I won't really do you any harm  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
Just like you used to do  
There's no love that you're over feeling  
And you still want to be with me  
But you're leaving like you said that you would  
I'm waiting for the call  
And you love like you always say now  
But you know it won't do you any harm  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would  
Oh then ride it on baby,  
Just like you know it's understood  
Ride it on baby,  
It's still into your view  
Ride it on baby,  
I only want to be with you  
I'm dreaming that you're going far,  
And you lie, take and whine  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
But you're so heavy for the price  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would
