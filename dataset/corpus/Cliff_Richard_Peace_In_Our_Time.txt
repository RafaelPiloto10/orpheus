Go swiftly  
The flags and drums can hypnotise  
When glory has faded the dream  
Is worth more than the prize  
A twisting turning flame  
And a freedom burning bright  
Knows all of the names  
And all of the games  
Of the yellow, black and white  
We've gotta have faith  
To work it out  
Faith and hope  
Without any doubt  
Give us strength to make a start  
Put a song in our hearts...  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
Softly, softly  
When there is lightning in the sky  
When the rivers are rising and  
Trouble rolls in on the tide  
We'll keep on keeping on  
'Til all the tears are dry  
We'll weather the storm  
Welcome the dawn  
Of tomorrow you and I  
We've gotta have faith  
And get it fast  
Faith and hope  
And make it last  
Give us strength  
To reach the stars  
Put a song in our hearts  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
We're raisin' the dust  
It's heaven or bust  
And we'll see this dream come true  
We're gonna have faith (faith)  
The road will be long  
But there's hope (hope)  
To carry us on  
We'll have strength (strength)  
We'll never go wrong  
With this song in our hearts  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
At the sign (sign)  
Of the dove  
Is gonna shine (shine)  
On a wing  
And a prayer  
We'll be fine  
Fine  
Fine  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time
