I've been working  
I've been working so hard  
I've been working  
I've been working so hard  
I come home make love to you  
Makin' love to you, now  
  
I've been grinding  
I've been grinding for so long  
I've been grinding  
Grinding for so long  
I come home  
I want you in my arms  
I want you in my arms  
  
I said woman woman woman woman woman  
Woman woman woman woman woman woman woman  
Hey  
  
I get so lonely  
Get so lonely  
Out on the road  
Gets so lonely  
I've been grinding  
I've been grinding for so long  
13 years I've been working baby  
Working for so long  
When I get home  
You best be in my arms  
I want you in my arms  
  
And I said woman woman woman woman woman  
Woman woman woman woman woman woman woman
