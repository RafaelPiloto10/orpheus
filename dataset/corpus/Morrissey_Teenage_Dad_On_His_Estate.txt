You chase in the rat-race  
And you always feel so hollow  
You marry because it's expected of you  
And it only makes you feel more lonely  
But still you look down on the  
Teenage dad on his estate  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his baby and his modest home  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his Jensen Interceptor  
It's just a runaround  
  
You defer to the views of the television news  
Let someone do your thinking for you  
And you still buy a daily newspaper  
And you find everything there but the news  
And still you look down on the  
Teenage dad on his estate  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his baby and his modest home  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his Jensen Interceptor  
It's just a runaround  
  
You become your parents' parent  
And you love them  
But you can't help feeling used  
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate  
Because he's poor but he's happier than you  
They're all laughing at you  
You're a dipper, a slider, cart-horse provider  
Nobody cares about you  
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in  
Despising the grin on the face of the boy  
With the methadone ahh  
With his methadone  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his methadone  
He's happy - so leave him alone
