Yeah yeahhh  
She was sitting right in front of me  
But she kept looking back at me  
She said do you need some company? (Anybody sitting right there?)  
Cause I would love if you would come with me  
  
And girl I really wanna take you out  
Show you what I'm all about  
Baby let me work you out  
There's nothing in between us now  
  
I see the want too in your eyes  
Don't fight it, don't be afraid  
I know you want to  
So don't lie  
Show you why you need me  
  
Don't let this moment be in vain  
Don't let me slip away  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
Don't let the seconds turn to minutes  
Please don't make me wait  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
  
I just wanna connect with you mentally  
Cause I'm attracted to you physically  
You remind me of a science class  
I wanna study your anatomy  
  
Giving you the green light  
Don't treat me like a stop sign  
Oh no girl  
Don't let me immediate you  
Let me embrace you  
  
I see the want too in your eyes  
Don't fight it, don't be afraid  
I know you want to  
So don't lie  
Show you why you need me  
  
Don't let this moment be in vain  
Don't let me slip away  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
Don't let the seconds turn to minutes  
Please don't make me wait  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
  
Don't let this moment be in vain  
Don't let me slip away  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
Don't let the seconds turn to minutes  
Please don't make me wait  
You'll regret it tomorrow  
You'll regret it tomorrow
