This reign of plastic  
That replaced the reign of gold  
Couldn't have known that you  
Would feel so undersold  
If love was built on hindsight  
Then you surely would have seen  
You were joining hands  
With the Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But can you choose a Queen  
When you behave like a drone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainly never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
I didn't mean to fool you  
Into feeling King  
Of anything but plastic  
And what plastic brings  
If gold is what she had  
It's what I could've been  
The unaffordable dream  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But don't expect a gem  
When you're quarrying for stone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainty never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
In future when that moan  
Has turned to prone  
And the slightest groan  
Feels so overblown  
Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb  
Runs the honeycomb  
  
Honeycomb, honey, honey  
Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb
