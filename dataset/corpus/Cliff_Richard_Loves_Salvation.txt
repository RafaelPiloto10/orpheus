I don't know how to play it,  
I don't know how to say it,  
But it's true,  
Oooooh I'm losing you.  
I only know that maybe,  
You and I have got to talk things trough,  
But baby before we do,  
I'm telling you.  
Chorus:  
You can go right on breaking my heart,  
I wouldn't care at all.  
You can go right on taking my love,  
I'll never close the door.  
And even thoughi know you don't  
Love me anymore,  
You can hurt me but you won't break down  
My love.  
I don't know what began it,  
It happens all the time,  
So I've been told,  
Love grows old and cold.  
Not for me the easy way,  
I love you then and now I love you still,  
And I guess I always will,  
Meanwhile....  
Repeat chorus  
Not for me the easy way,  
I don't want no trial seperation.  
I'd rather face the sleepless nights,  
Working on our love's salvation.  
Repeat chorus  
Love's salvation,  
(you've got to keep working on)  
Our love's salvation,  
(you've got to keep working on)  
Repeat 'til fade.........
