You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity  
The first time, every time when you touchin' me,  
I make you bloom like the flower that you never seen  
Under the sun we are one buzzin' energy  
  
Let's pollinate, let's create a family tree  
This evolution with you comes naturally  
Some call it science,  
We call it chemistry  
This is the story of the birds and the bees  
  
Even the seasons change  
Our love still stays the same  
  
You give me that  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Flown a million miles just to find the magic seed  
Oh I would flower with the power that bring light to me  
Your so exotic, my whole body fluttering  
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet  
  
Always on the brink of a heart attack  
You keep me alive and keep me coming back  
I see the sun rise in your eyes  
Your eyes  
You gotta future full of blue skies  
Blue skies  
  
Even when seasons change  
I'm still stay the same  
  
You give me that  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
You love me, you love me never love me not  
Not  
Oh no  
When we're in perfect harmony  
You make me sound like, like a symphony  
  
Oh your wings could make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hey yeah  
Hummingbird heartbeat

Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat
