Looking up from where I stand  
I see the vapor trail  
Of a jet plane in the sky  
  
Here the wheel is in my hand  
But there's no wind in my sails  
And life is drifting by  
  
Still I hold on and wait  
I know it's not too late  
And my breeze will come  
  
Muse you satisfy my soul  
Keep me warm while the  
Cold world guards the gate  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Your love has kept my dream alive  
A vision of my life  
With you here by my side  
  
Every forward step I take  
Every moment I'm awake  
I feel your love inside  
  
So close I feel it in my bones  
I know I'm not alone as I climb this wall  
But I, sometimes I get so high  
I just want to live, love  
And taste it all  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Here tonight  
I lie awake and watch you dream  
Under the light of the moon  
I wonder just how far we've been  
And where we'll be  
When the sun comes up  
Will this be our date with destiny  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
And I'm waiting
