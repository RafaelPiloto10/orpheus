Pumping your blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping your blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
  
If I pump out blood in the sunshine  
Oil on the wheel  
That is blasted and busted away  
A nail or a little piece of glass  
A little piece of glass  
A little piece of glass  
Swarming like bees over the air  
Off the pump off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
  
Off the pump  
Off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
Off the pump  
Off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
If I pump blood in the sunshine  
And you wear a leather box with azaleas  
And I pump more blood  
And it seeps through my skin  
Will you adore the river  
The stream, the trickle  
The tributary of my heart  
As I pump more blood  
And it seeps through my skin  
Will you adore the river  
The stream, the trickle  
The tributary of my heart  
  
If I'm pumping blood  
Like a common state worker  
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute  
Would you think less of me  
And my coagulating heart  
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute  
Coagulating heart  
Pumping blood  
Come on James!  
  
Would you top me off  
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy  
While you yell out, "mercy"  
We grow apart  
Would you rip and cut me  
Use a knife on me  
  
Be shocked at the boldness  
The coldness of this little heart  
Tied up in leather  
Would you take the measure  
Of the blood that I pump  
In the manic confusion of love  
  
Supreme violation  
Supreme violation  
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"  
"Oh Jack I beseech you"  
Supreme violation  
Blood in the foyer  
The bathroom  
The tea room  
The kitchen, with her knives splayed  
I will swallow your sharpest cutter  
Like a colored man's dick  
Blood spurting from me  
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech"  
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech"  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
"Oh Jack I beseech you"  
As I scream out my pain  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
In the end, in the end, in the end  
It was an ordinary heart  
"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"  
Supreme violation oh  
"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"  
I call out your name  
  
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,  
The tea room, the kitchen  
And knives splayed  
I swallow your sharpest cutter  
Like a colored man's dick  
Blood spurting from me  
Blood spurting from me  
"Oh Jack"  
"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
Pumping blood
