I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,  
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,  
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.  
Raindrops have brought us together,  
And that's what I long to see.  
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.  
So I'll be the fella, that fella with an umbrella,  
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
  
Oh, the raindrops have brought us together,  
And that's what I long to see.  
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a big break for me.  
So I'll be the fella, the kid with the small umbrella,  
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
If you will be the girl, the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
