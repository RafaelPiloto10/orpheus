Blue the color suits you cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever?  
Blue again it's a lasting chill  
To keep you cold as winter  
How can I forget you?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Blue the color fools you cool blue  
I'll never stay away for ever  
How can I forget you?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
Blue the color suits you cool blue  
Blue the color fools you blue again  
Blue, cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever?  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?
