Wake up  
You're beautiful, loved and blessed  
Feel me? (I think I do)  
  
When you found me I was just a piece of clay  
I was formless, you gave me a new name  
With the breath of life I now live abundantly  
All I needed was the potter's hand  
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)  
  
But to much power (tell it)  
Can can sometimes turn to shame  
To much desire  
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)  
But forgiveness is how you win the game  
I begged for truth, now I know the truth  
And that is when you came and said I was  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
I'm better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am,  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game  
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?  
Always trying to break you down  
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up  
I just wanna be happy  
Come take this bitter cup from me  
  
If I were ever to write my life story  
I could truly say through all the pain and glory  
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand  
Cause when you whispered in my ear  
The words I so now understand, oh  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
I'm better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am,  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Everything you made you said, "That's good"  
Before the fall of man you said, "That's good"  
Every time I walk in faith, that's good  
You let me see another day, that's good  
Before the earth was made you said,  
"Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far"  
Knowledge and understanding  
Understanding is good  
And when I wake up in the morning  
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you rescue me from the darkness  
And our heart just must confess  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wake up it's a new day  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wave you're hands in the air and say  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wake up it's a new day  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wave you're hands in the air and say  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness  
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed  
No matter what the challenge  
I always pass the test  
  
That's what I am, beautiful  
That's what I am, beautiful  
I don't mean to put nobody down  
Still I must confess that I am  
Beautiful, that's what I am  
That's what I am  
When you wanna give up, don't cause you know  
You always got a friend  
  
That's what I am, that's what I am  
That's' what I am  
Beautiful, beautiful  
That's what I am, that's what I am  
That's' what I am  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful
