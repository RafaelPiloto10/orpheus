Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darling  
That it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger  
If I lived to be a hundred years old  
  
Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darling  
That it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
Now you say you've found someone you love better  
That's the way it's happened every time before  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
Crying time will start when you walk out the door  
  
Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes
