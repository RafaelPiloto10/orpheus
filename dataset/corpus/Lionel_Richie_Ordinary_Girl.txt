How will I know if someone loves me  
How will I know if there is no one else  
Dying to have someone who loves me  
But I want them to love me for myself  
  
Looked for love in all the wrong places  
I searched the moon and stars  
Found myself lost in a world full of faces  
The place I didn't look was my heart  
  
I've been all around the world try to find something new,  
Lord knows that something was you  
'Cause I found in myself the one thing that is true  
All I want is an ordinary girl  
  
All I need is an ordinary girl  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
All I want is someone I can talk to  
Someone I can lean on now and then  
And I don't want to lie, pretend I am someone else  
I am just looking for a friend  
My heart was going through so many changes,  
I didn't know which way to turn  
Just when I thought I had all of the answers  
I found I still had so much to learn  
  
I've been all around the world try to find something new,  
Lord knows that something was you  
'Cause I found in myself the one thing that is true  
All I want is an ordinary girl  
All I need is an ordinary girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone to love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to feel lost in love forever  
Want to see that look in your eyes  
I hope that you understand what I am saying, baby  
Cause girl I need you right by my side  
I've been all around the world trying to find something new,  
Lord knows that something was you  
'Cause I found in myself  
The one thing that is true  
All I want is an ordinary girl  
All I need is an ordinary girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone to love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talking: You know I've been all around the world  
Trying to find someone new  
He, you know what ended up my search:  
That someone was you  
And I found in my heart there can be no one but you  
All I need is an ordinary girl  
Your love, my love  
You know heaven send you from above  
Oh girl, it is only you  
You are the best thing in my life girl  
You are the best thing in my life ooh  
Ooh girl
