Love gives  
Love takes  
It takes a lot of lucky breaks  
Lucky strikes  
Lucky stars  
I don't know how I got this far  
Who knows where it's coming from  
Or where it's going to  
Can I go all the way with you?  
  
You have your way  
You have your doubts  
The falling in  
The falling out  
A bridge is built  
A bridge is burned  
Till you reach the point of no return  
Don't know where we're coming from  
Or where we're going to  
  
Can I go all the way with you?  
Heaven knows that this ain't nothing new  
God knows how much I love you  
Love comes  
Love goes  
Can I go all the way with you?  
Can I go all the way with you?
