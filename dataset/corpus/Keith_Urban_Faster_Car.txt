Any time that you want what you need  
Close your eyes, say my name, call on me  
And I'll be there for you no matter what they say  
Rain, hail or shine  
I got my eye spy to the sky, waitin' on your sign  
  
Roll the dice, take a chance, a chance on me  
'Cause you never can tell where a little bit of faith might lead  
I got a you shaped hole inside  
I swear, it gets deeper by the day  
Flickin' cigarettes out the window, goin' no where in this lonely rain  
  
[Chorus]  
I need a faster car now  
A rocket ship straight to the moon  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much I need you, baby  
  
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a damn shame  
But you're the 'cause, and you're the cure of all my pain  
There's never been a bigger fool for you  
I can't believe my pride  
You got me talkin' to an empty pillow in the middle of the night  
I ain't slept in quite a while  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I need a faster car now  
I'm a rocket man in love with you  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much you drive me crazy  
Show you how much I need you, baby
