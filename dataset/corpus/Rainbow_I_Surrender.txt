I surrender to your heart babe  
Do anything that you want me to do  
Please be tender I'm in your hands girl  
This is a feeling I never knew  
You know I tried to make it on my own  
That's not the way it was meant to be  
Spend my time waiting by the phone  
Oh darling come back to me  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
I'm giving up the role of pretender  
Oh be tender, Girl be tender  
Can't you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I remember, seems like a lifetime  
Can't believe it's a matter of days  
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak  
I want you so bad don't turn away  
What does it take to stay by my side  
You know I'll do what you want me to  
Don't take away this feeling inside  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
I'm giving up the role of pretender  
I remember, I remember  
Can't you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
Darling now won't you be tender  
Surrender, oh surrender  
Feel the love that I send her  
I surrender
