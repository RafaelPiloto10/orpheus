You're the sweetest one I know and I just can't let you go  
I just dream of holding you inside my arms  
I go home each night to stay but I just can't stay away  
And we get closer closer by the hour  
We get closer by the hour though we've tried with all our power  
To stay away from each other's arms  
We get closer by the hour like the bee goes to the flower  
Closer closer by the hour  
We come closer with each kiss and I feel your lips insist  
But I do your will and love you more and more  
Although we know it's wrong we can't stay where we belong  
And we get closer closer by the hour  
We get closer by the hour...
