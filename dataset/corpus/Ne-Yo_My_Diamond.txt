You are the Lady in My Life  
  
I'm a rich man  
They cut my lights off yesterday  
And I don't have the money to pay  
My baby lights a candlelight anyway  
So we're OK  
I'm a rich man  
But I don't have a job currently  
And that's just fine with my baby and me  
Cause we find other ways to keep busy  
You know what I mean  
  
Chorus  
You're my diamond  
Baby I love the way you shine  
Shine baby (Shine baby)  
Your my diamond girl I'm so glad to say you're mine  
  
I'm a rich man  
But I don't have a car to drive  
And truthfully I don't even mind  
My baby walks around with me all the time oh yeah  
  
I'm a rich man  
Said I'm the wealthiest man in the world  
But I've got no money no goals no string of pearls  
I don't need nothing as long as I got my girl  
Cause she's my world  
  
Repeat chorus
