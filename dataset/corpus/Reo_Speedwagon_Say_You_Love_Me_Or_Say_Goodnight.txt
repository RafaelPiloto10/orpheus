Here I come again  
I don't really care to turn back  
Trying to find you directions  
But I seem to be losin' track  
  
I believe we ought to make a run for it  
Just to see how far we can go  
I ain't just around for the fun of it  
But until you try it, baby, you'll never know so  
  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
Say we've made up or on with the fight  
Cause there's no love lying' in the eyes of the night so,  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
  
There's no use hangin' on a memory  
No good livin' a lie  
I got no use for mediocrity  
You know tonight's the night  
We either do it or die
