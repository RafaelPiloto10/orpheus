Seperate the weak from the ob-solete  
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets  
It's on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef  
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek  
Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet  
Thundering, shaking the concrete  
Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot  
Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots  
Saw me in the drop, three in the corner  
  
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter  
Old school new school need to learn though  
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno  
Burn slow like blunts with ya-yo  
Peel more skins than Idaho potato  
Niggaz know, the lyrics molestin is takin place  
Fuckin with B.I.G. it ain't safe  
I make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses  
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Landcruisers  
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools  
Niggaz mad because I know that Cash Rules  
Everything Around Me, two glock nines  
Any motherfucker whispering about mines  
And I'm, Crooklyn's finest  
You rewind this, Bad Boy's behind this

Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps

One false move, get swiss cheesed up  
Clip to Tec, respect I demand it  
Slip and break the, 11th Commandment  
Thou shalt not fuck with raw C-Poppa  
Feel a thosand deaths when I drop ya  
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don  
Pussy when I want Rolex on the arm  
You'll die slow but calm  
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake  
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga  
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga  
Puff Daddy flips daily  
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Bailey's  
On the rocks, tote glocks at christenings  
And my cock, in the fire position and...
