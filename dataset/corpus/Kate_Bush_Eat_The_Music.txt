Split me open  
With devotion  
You put your hands in  
And rip my heart out  
Eat the music  
  
Does he conceal  
What he really feels?  
He's a woman at heart  
And I love him for that  
Let's split him open  
  
Like a pomegranate  
Insides out  
All is revealed  
Not only women bleed  
  
Take the stone out  
Of the mango  
You put it in your mouth  
And pull a plum out  
  
Take a papaya  
You like a guava?  
Grab a banana  
And a sultana  
Rip them to pieces  
With sticky fingers  
Split the banana  
Crush the sultana  
  
Split 'em open  
With devotion  
You put your hands in  
And rip their hearts out  
  
Like a pomegranate  
Insides out  
He's a woman at heart  
And love him for that  
  
Take a papaya  
You like a guava?  
Grab a banana  
And a sultana  
Rip them to pieces  
With sticky fingers  
Split the banana  
Crush the sultana  
  
All emotion  
And with devotion  
You put your hands in  
What ya thinking?  
What am I singing?  
A song of seeds  
The food of love  
Eat the music
