The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that there's nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
I'm late for work, I get another warning  
I don't think I'd stay around here if it wasn't for you  
  
All the friends I had at school  
Went their separate ways  
Some I don't miss, some I do  
But when I see them we've got nothing to say  
Every weekday goes so slow  
Weekends go too fast  
Must make up my mind to go  
Before another year goes past  
  
The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that there's nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
I'm late for work, I get another warning  
And I don't think I'd stay around here if it wasn't for you  
  
Same old faces every night  
Every day it rains  
Repetition drives me crazy  
I just can't stand it all over again  
  
The clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that there's nothing to do  
  
I'm saving my cash to get out of here  
You can come too  
You don't get me down like the others do  
  
Seems to me I wake up bored  
Seven days a week  
I need a chance to speak my mind  
Before I've got no mind to speak  
Can't believe the friends I've seen  
Think they're doing fine  
It's not enough for me  
And I know that I'm just wasting time  
  
Because the clock goes round and round  
And I get so tired of this old town  
But I still hang around though I know that there's nothing to do  
Seems every monday morning  
I'm late for work, I get another warning  
I don't think I'd stay around here if it wasn't for you
