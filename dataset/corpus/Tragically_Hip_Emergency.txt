I've often dreamt of a conversation  
That just keeps coming up again and again.  
We're sitting in the Baby Bar bereft  
At a shadowy table out past the sentences end.  
From until it's no longer fun  
'Til that's no longer relevant.  
From until we're no longer one  
'Til the bona-fide embodiment of an endless  
Emergency without end.  
We're an endless emergency without end  
  
We often stop in these conversations,  
Things we say here stay here forever amen.  
When everything seems either funny or lousy,  
Funny or lousy, that's where it usually ends.  
From until we're no longer fun  
'Til that's no longer relevant.  
From until we're no longer one  
'Til that's no longer permanent.  
From the last survivors of those terms  
To the bona-fide embodiment  
Of an endless emergency  
Without end.  
We're an endless emergency  
Without end.  
We're an endless emergency  
Without end,  
  
But  
Your finger starts to wiggle  
And  
Landscapes emerge
