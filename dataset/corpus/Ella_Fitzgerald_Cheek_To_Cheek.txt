Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh, I'd love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Now, mama, dance with me  
I want my arms about you  
The charms about you  
Will carry me through, yes  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
(Sing it, Ella, swing it)  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh, I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Come on and dance with me  
I want my arm about you  
The charm about you  
Will carry me through to  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Yes, dance with me  
I want my arms about you  
The charms about you  
Will carry me through to  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
Cheek to cheek  
Cheek to cheek  
Cheek to cheek
