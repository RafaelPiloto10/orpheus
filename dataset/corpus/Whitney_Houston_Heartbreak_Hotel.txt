This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
  
You said you'd be here by nine  
Instead you took your time  
You didn't think to call me, boy  
Here I sit trying not to cry  
Asking myself why  
You do this to me, mm oh baby  
  
Since you're not around  
For me to tell ya baby, face to face  
I'm writing you this letter  
And this is what I have to say  
  
1 - All I really wanted was some of your time  
Instead you told me lies  
When someone else was on your mind  
What you do to me  
Look what you did to me  
  
I thought that you were someone  
Who would do me right  
Until you played with my emotions  
And you made me cry  
What you do to me  
Can't take what you did to me  
  
Now I see that you've been doin' wrong  
Played me all along  
And made a fool of me, baby  
You got it all wrong  
To think that I wouldn't find out  
That you were cheating on me, baby  
How could you do it to me  
  
Since you're not around  
For me to tell ya baby, face to face  
I'm writing you this letter  
And this is what I have to say  
  
[Repeat 1]  
Heartbreak hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
  
[Repeat 1 ]with ad lib until fade
