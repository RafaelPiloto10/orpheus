[Chorus]  
Oh a lifetime isn't enough to love you  
And a lifetime isn't enough to live  
Oh a lifetime isn't enough to love you  
And one lifetime isn't enough to live  
  
I may be different than you, criticized for what I do  
I chose to explore the truth, the truth of me  
And I won't be afraid on that day  
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood  
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Been around so many people, without you I'm always alone  
Gazing into space, my existence unknown  
I don't want to be here, I wanna be near  
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood  
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Am I so different than you, criticized for what I do  
I chose to explore the truth, the truth of you  
And I won't be afraid on that day  
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
  
( Chorus )  
  
Hey a lifetime isn't enough to love you  
And one lifetime isn't enough to live
