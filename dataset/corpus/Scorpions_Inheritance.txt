Test the mend, devil melt  
Bloody money when it's lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money, oh  
  
Heavenly won't it be  
Here's some money  
Belong to thee  
I will pay they will say  
Give your money, oh  
  
Obligator came and said to me  
Why don't you pay your debt  
The debt that you amend  
Asking him forgive on his demand  
For I am with a mate  
Despite in her return  
Remittance of the debt  
I can't accept  
He told me and he capped  
Quite time on his demand  
  
Imaginations came into my brain  
'Cause if you patients came  
That brings me in my break  
  
Test the mend, devil mend  
Bloody money when it's lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money, oh
