We've got a nice little house on a quiet little street  
But it don't matter  
A two garage with a new Cherokee  
But it don't matter  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we don't ever seem to talk anymore  
And you don't hold me like you did before  
We've got everything we wanted and more  
But now I know and now I see  
Nothing matters if you don't love me  
  
We've given twelve precious years of our lives  
But it don't matter  
And I guess for awhile we were both satisfied  
But it don't matter  
It wouldn't be easy to walk out tonight  
But it don't matter  
And I know I would miss you if you said goodbye  
But it don't matter
