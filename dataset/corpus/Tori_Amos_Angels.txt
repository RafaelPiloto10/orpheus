With a wink  
And a smile  
You toss your instructions on  
How to catch a train  
While it's moving  
You always were the one  
That kept us all guessing  
How you could survive  
The fall you had  
  
from medicine men  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
"He's got to watch his back"  
  
they're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But it's not how you think  
You'd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you can't remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
Tell me where they've gone  
  
From Jordan to Chicago  
Another child is born  
Trusting that we'll get it  
Right this time  
I should've worn my glasses  
You said just to trust  
Then you chose  
To sign the dotted line  
  
From modern Magdalenes  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
"He's got to watch his back"  
  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But it's not how you think  
You'd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you can't remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
  
Before I close my eyes at night  
I can still see you smilin'  
Before the truth was  
Buried alive  
Did we prize it  
Before you change the world  
Maybe boy you should change  
Your girl  
  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
They're trapping angels  
Lord I know this  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But we're getting closer  
I said we're getting closer  
To where they've gone  
Tell me where they've gone  
  
Now it won't be long
