A cowboy with his sweetheart stood beneath a starlit sky  
Tomorrow he was leaving for the lonesome prairie wide  
She said "I'll be your lovingbride when you return someday"  
He handed her a broken ring and to her he did say  
  
"You'll find upon that ring sweetheart my name engraved in gold  
And I shall keep the other half which bears your name you know."  
He went away to ride and toil this cowboy brave and bold  
But long he stayed and while he strayed the maiden's love grew cold.  
  
Three years had passed, he did not some, and Nell will wed tonight  
Her father said an Earl would make her happy home so bright  
The lights were gaily glowing as they stood there side by side  
"Let's drink a toast to this young man and to his lovely bride."  
  
Just then there stood within the door a figure tall and slim  
A handsome cowboy was their guest and slowly he walked in  
"I'll drink with you a toast." said he, and quickly in her glass  
He dropped his half of wedding ring, then anxiously he watched.  
  
She tipped her glass and from her lips a ring fell shining bright  
The token she had longed to see lay there beneath the light  
"Though years have been between us dear, love won our last long fight,  
It's you my cowboy sweetheart and my Jack I'll wed tonight."
