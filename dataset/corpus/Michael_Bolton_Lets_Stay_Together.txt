I, I'm so in love with you  
Whatever you want to do  
Is all right with me  
'Cause you make me feel so brand new  
And I want to spend my life with you  
  
Since, since we've been together  
Loving you forever  
Is what I need  
Let me be the one you come running to  
I'll never be untrue  
  
Let's, let's stay together  
Lovin' you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad  
  
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad  
Why, why some people break up  
Then turn around and make up  
I just can't see  
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)  
Staying around you is all I see  
(Here's what I want us to do)  
  
Let's, we oughta stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
