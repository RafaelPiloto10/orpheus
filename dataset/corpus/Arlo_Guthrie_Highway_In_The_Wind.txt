Sail with me into the unknown void  
That has no end  
Swept along the open road  
That don't seem to begin  
Come with me a love me, Babe  
I may be back again  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
Evenings just begin the days  
And follows with the night  
To love you and to be with you  
And say that it's all right  
Love me while you have me, Babe  
I may be back again  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
There's times I feel like going  
And there's times I want to stay  
Times that I ain't feeling well  
And times I feel ok  
Now you have time to love me, Babe  
And I may have time agian  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
The fortune teller tells me  
I have somewhere to go  
I look and try to understand  
And wonder how she knows  
So I must be going now  
I'm losing time my friend  
Looking for a rainbow  
Down this highway in the wind
