If I could only have one wish this holiday  
Without a second thought I'd have to say  
That you can't find what I want in any store  
I just want you to be mine and nothing more  
No brand new clothes could fill my lonely soul  
When the snow falls on the ground and it gets cold  
No expensive gift you put under my tree  
Will keep me warm this holiday if you're not holding me  
I don't want diamond rings, perfume or brand new shoes  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway for you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you  
  
If I could win your heart and show you how I feel  
Ain't no way you're gonna find a better deal  
I've been saving all my loving for so long  
And after Christmas is over it still keeps going on  
Everyday would be like Christmas from now on  
Santa bring that love to me where it belongs  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway for you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you  
  
I don't want diamond rings, perfume or brand new shoes  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway for you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you
