If you can hear this  
Don't assume that I'm talking to you  
Yesterday everything I thought I believed in died  
But today is my birthday,  
Today is my birthday  
I don't need you,  
I'll say it to myself  
It doesn't mean I won't need somebody  
Anyone with half a soul  
Will hear this and they'll never leave me  
  
If you don't know what forever feels like  
I'll show you what it feels like without it  
I'll show you what it feels like without it  
  
This time I won't hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
This time I won't hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
  
I can get by now  
I'm not really dead  
But I really needed someone to save me  
Leaving me alone to die  
Is worse than having the guts to kill me  
  
If you don't know what forever feels like  
I'll show you what it feels like without it  
I'll show you what it feels like without it  
  
This time I won't hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
This time I won't hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
  
Not letting you win  
Won't satisfy me  
I'll teach you about loss
