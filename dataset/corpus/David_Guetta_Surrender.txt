You have the key, to unlock the door  
I'm a "casualty" of this emotional war  
Can't break the chains, but I'm the one to gain  
Give it all to keep  
You rock you rocking with me  
  
And I can't escape  
You gotta come my love  
I'm a prisoner for you I surrender  
I surrender  
I surrender my love  
I surrender  
I surrender my heart  
  
I can't ignore what fate has for us  
Can run but can't hide  
No getting away from love  
My hands are tide  
I'm bound to this faring  
Keeps calling me  
And I must get in  
  
You gotta come my love  
I'm a prisoner for you I surrender  
I surrender  
I surrender my love  
I surrender  
I surrender my heart
