I want to move in time with you  
I want to breathe in rhyme with you  
I want to feel the deepest kiss  
And I want to know you feel like this  
  
This one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
  
I want to feel your hand in mine  
I want to feel that rush in my spine  
I want to wear the scent of you  
And do all the things you want me to  
  
So baby this one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
  
I feel the danger of separation  
I want to take your invitation  
Separation, it's all around  
I need this side of me  
  
I want to move in time with you  
And I want to breathe in rhyme with you  
I want to stage my glows in sin  
And in the dark I want to find that golden glow within  
  
For this one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
No I am not afraid to let you see this side of me
