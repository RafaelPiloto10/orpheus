Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room  
Young girl, violence, center of her own attention  
The mother reads aloud child tries to understand it  
Tries to make her proud  
  
The shades go down it's in her head  
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong  
  
Don't call me daughter not fit to  
The picture kept will remind me  
Don't call me daughter not fit to  
The picture kept will remind me  
  
Don't call me,  
She holds the hand that holds her down  
She will, rise above  
  
Don't call me daughter, not fit to  
The picture kept will remind me  
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be  
The picture kept will remind me  
Don't call me daughters  
  
The shades go down  
The shades go, go, go
