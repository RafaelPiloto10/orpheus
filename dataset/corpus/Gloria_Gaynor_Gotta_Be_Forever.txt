Let me hear a little backing track  
  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up  
  
I know you're wondering where I've been  
Sweet songs of love got me coming in  
Wanted to leave yeah, just walk away  
But this is real and I'm here to stay  
  
Well so afraid of being sad and blue  
Talked to myself and said I'm over you  
But now it's time for me to make you see  
These chains of love got a hold on me  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
  
Never knew love would make me feel this way  
You make me happy and I'm gonna stay  
Whenever life was getting out of hand  
I turned to you and you would understand  
  
You lift me up when I'm feeling down  
I got my feet back on solid ground  
You make me smile when I wanna cry  
I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
  
I'm giving it up, I'm giving it up  
And I'm here to stay  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever, gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Can't get enough, want more and more
