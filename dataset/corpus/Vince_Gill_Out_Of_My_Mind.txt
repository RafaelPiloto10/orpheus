You've got legs just like a long neck bottle  
And lips just like strawberry wine  
You might be a lifetime of trouble  
But still I can't get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind, I'm goin' out of my mind  
And I see what I've been missin' all this time  
Oh, sweet neon angel, don't leave me behind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind  
  
You're bringin' on a honky-tonk heartache  
And I know you'd never walk the line  
To let you slip away, it's a chance I won't take  
Still I can't get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind, I'm goin' out of my mind  
And I see what I've been missin' all this time  
Oh, sweet neon angel, don't leave me behind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind
