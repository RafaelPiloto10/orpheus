My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable  
Yet, you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day
