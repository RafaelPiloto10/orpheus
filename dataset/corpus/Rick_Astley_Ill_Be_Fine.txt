Day and night, I wonder how you're feeling  
I wonder if you'll ever change your mind  
I don't know just what it is you're dealing  
But I know you've got me in a bind  
  
[Bridge:]  
Day and night, I wonder how you do it  
Put me in this awful state of mind  
How on earth can you be so unfeeling?  
How on earth can you be so unkind?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well, I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
  
You never want to sit and talk it over  
You always want to run right out the door  
Come and sit right down here on the sofa  
Tell me, baby, right now what's the score?  
  
Don't you tell me there ain't nothing doing  
There ain't nothing else that's true to say  
I just wanna hear my baby cooing  
I don't wanna hear our love is dead  
  
I will be fine with you if you be good to me  
  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
  
If you'll be good to me, I'll be fine with you  
If you'll be good to me, then we just can't lose  
If you'll be good to me, I'll be happy for all of my days  
  
Day and night, I wonder how you're feeling  
I wonder if you'll ever change your mind  
I don't know just what it is you're dealing  
But I know you've got me in a bind  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
