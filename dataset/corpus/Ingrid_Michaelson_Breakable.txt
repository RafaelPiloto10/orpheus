Have you ever thought about what protects our hearts?  
Just a cage of rib bones and other various parts.  
So it's fairly simple to cut right through the mess.  
And to stop the muscle that makes us confess.  
  
We are so fragile,  
And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable, girls and boys.  
  
You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law.  
In your two ton death trap I finally saw.  
A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret.  
Then you drove me to places I'll never forget.  
  
And we are so fragile,  
And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls and boys.  
  
And we are so fragile,  
And our our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls-  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls-  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls and boys.
