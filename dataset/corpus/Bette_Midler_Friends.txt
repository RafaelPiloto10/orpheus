And I am all alone.  
There is no one here beside me.  
And my problems have all gone.  
There is no one to deride me.  
  
But you got to have friends.  
The feeling's oh so strong.  
You got to have friends  
To make that day last long.  
  
I had some friends but they're gone,  
Somethin' came and took them away.  
And from the dusk 'til the dawn  
Here is where I'll stay.  
  
Standing at the end of the road, boys,  
Waiting for my new friends to come.  
I don't care if I'm hungry or poor,  
I'm gonna get me some of them.  
  
Cause you got to have friends.  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, friends.  
That's right you, oh you, yeah you,  
I said you gotta have some friends,  
I'm talkin' about friends, that's right, friends.  
Friends, friends, friends.  
  
I had some friends, oh, but they're all gone, gone,  
Someone came and snatched them away.  
And from the dusk until the very dawn, you know,  
Here is where I gotta stay, here is where I gotta stay.  
  
And I'm standing at the end of a real long road  
And I'm waiting for my new friends to come.  
I don't care if I'm hungry or freezin' cold,  
I'm gonna get me some of them.  
  
Cause you gotta have friends,  
That's right, friends, friends.  
I gotta me my, I gotta me my, I gotta me my,  
Look around and see all of my friends.  
Oh, friends, that's right, friends, friends,  
Friends, friends, friends, friends, oh,  
Friends, you gotta have friends...
