There's only one thing that money can't buy  
True love, that will never die, oh no, no  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
  
If religion was a thing that money could buy  
Well the rich would live and the poor would die  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
  
Well, the river of Jordan is chilly and cold, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Chills the body but not the soul, yeah  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
