I met a magic man  
Who had a daughter  
She learned her lessons well  
But still I taught her  
She followed willingly  
As lambs to slaughter  
We shared forbidden fruit  
And things I brought her  
  
You may say I'm a miracle mannequin  
Here I come with my mystical plan again  
I know you think I can  
I'm just a man  
  
I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
  
I followed willingly  
Her sweet temptation  
She had me hypnotized  
But still I'm waiting  
My dromedary dreams  
As wet as oceans  
With sand dunes bearing seeds  
She set in motion  
  
You may say I'm a cynical charlatan  
There I go with my whimsical ways again  
Although you think I can  
I'm just a man  
  
That I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
I don't walk on water  
(Oh no)  
  
The light is guiding eyes  
As I look in on you  
And the long is getting shorter  
As the far is now nearer  
  
Are you just a mirror  
Standing in front of me?  
In my mind?  
Can my eyes really see?  
  
You may say I'm a miracle mannequin,  
There I go with my mystical plan again,  
Although you think I can, I'm just a man  
I don't walk on water, (oh no)x4  
  
My dromedary dreams  
As wet as oceans  
With sand dunes bearing seeds  
She set in motion  
My dromedary dreams x4 (fading out)
