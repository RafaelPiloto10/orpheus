Well now it takes more than a robin  
To make the winter go  
  
And it takes two lips for fire  
To melt away the snow  
Well it takes two hearts a cookin'  
To make a fire grow  
And baby you've got what it takes  
Now listen honey  
  
Alright baby  
  
You know it takes  
A lot of kissin'  
To make a romance sweep  
Oh it takes a lot of lovin'  
To make my life complete  
  
Oh, well it takes somebody special  
To knock me off my feet  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
Hmm  
  
I said,  
Oh,  
Uh huh,  
Oh,  
Oh you've got just what it takes  
Because it takes more  
Than an effort, to stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that I'll be true  
Yeah,  
But it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
  
Ah ha,  
Oh,  
Ah ha,  
Oh,  
Oh you've got just what it takes  
Oh, because it takes a lot of effort  
To stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that I'll be true  
Well it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
Come on say that again honey  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
One more time, come on  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
You got it, you got it  
Mm hmm, you know you've got what it takes  
You've got it, you got it  
Baby don't you know you've got what it takes  
You got it, you got it
