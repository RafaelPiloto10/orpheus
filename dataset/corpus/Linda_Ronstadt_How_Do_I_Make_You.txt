You're a doll  
Your eyes see all  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
want to see me?  
  
You're so young  
But your feelings are deep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you feel for me  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And you're fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me?  
  
Ooh, ooh, baby  
The world's a wall of ice  
You're gonna need someone  
To treat you warm  
And keep you nice  
  
I like the way you dance  
The way you spin  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Spin for me?  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And you're fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me?  
Dream about me?
