These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Winter's come and gone  
And I've been left alone  
Now I'm here home with you (I'm here home with you)  
I do all the things that you do  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
Seems like a long, long time  
Since I've held you in these arms of mine  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
The winter's come and gone  
And I've been left all alone  
But, oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
And now that you're far away  
I think of your love  
And I'm praying that you're still mine  
  
These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right
