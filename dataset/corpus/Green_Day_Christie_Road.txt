Staring out of my window watching the cars go rolling by  
My friends are gone I've got nothing to do  
So I sit here patiently watching the clock tick so slowly  
Gotta get away or my brains will explode  
  
Give me something to do to kill some time  
Take me to that place that I call home  
Take away the strains of being lonely  
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road  
  
See the hills from afar standing on my beat up car  
The sun went down and the night fills the sky  
Now I feel like me once again as the train comes rolling in  
Smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high  
  
Give me something to do to kill some time  
Take me to that place that I call home  
Take away the strains of being lonely  
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road  
  
Mother, stay out of my way of that place we go  
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road  
Mother, stay out of my way of that place we go  
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road  
  
If there is one thing that I need that makes me feel complete  
So I go to Christie Road, it's home, it's home  
It's home, it's home, it's home
