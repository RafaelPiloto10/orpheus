(Original by Badfinger )  
  
Guess I got what I deserve,  
Kept you waiting there, too long my love  
All that time, without a word,  
Didn't know you'd think, that I'd forget, or I'd regret  
The special love I have for you, my baby blue  
All the days became so long,  
Did you really think, I'd do you wrong  
Dixie, when I let you go,  
Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show  
The special love I have for you, my baby blue  
What can I do, what can I say  
Except that I want you by my side  
How can I show, you, show me a way  
Don't you know, the times I tried (solo)  
Guess that's all I have to say,  
Except the feeling just gets stronger everyday  
Just one thing, before I go  
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow  
The special love, you have for me, my Dixie dear
