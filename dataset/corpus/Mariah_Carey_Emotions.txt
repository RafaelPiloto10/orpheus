You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
higher than the heavens above.  
I feel good, I feel nice.  
I've never felt so satisfied.  
I'm in love, I'm alive.  
Intoxicated, flying high.  
It feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly.  
I don't know if it's real  
But I like the way I feel inside.  
You've got me feeling emotions deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
In the morning when I rise,  
You are the first thing on my mind.  
And in the middle of the night  
I feel your heart-beat next to mine.  
It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly.  
I don't know if you're for real  
But I like the way I feel inside.  
You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
You know the way to make me lose control.  
When you're looking into my eyesyou make me feel so high!  
You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
You've got me feeling higher.
