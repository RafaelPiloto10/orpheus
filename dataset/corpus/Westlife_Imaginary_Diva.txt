Late last night I had a dream  
And it was then I seen her  
She didn't need no diamond rings  
Fancy cars, Versace things to please her  
She's my perfect girl  
And I call her my imaginary diva  
Every girl she passes by  
Just can't deny that they would love to be her  
All the guys comparing sizes  
Tucking shirts in, fixing ties to please her  
She's my perfect girl  
Exclusive to my world
