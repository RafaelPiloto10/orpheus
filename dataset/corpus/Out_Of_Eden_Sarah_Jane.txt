Little sarah jane ran away from home  
Fourteen and pregnent she was all alone  
Couldn't run from wrong, and was gonna be sent away  
Walkin' with her black and blue eyes full tears  
The burden that she carries much to old for her years  
Looking at her face would confirm your worst fears  
But instead she goes unnoticed  
Sarah Jane another girl who is dying inside  
You'd think that someone would stop  
But we hide, to intent on completing our day  
And she's left there to say  
Chorus:  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street watching you  
You could help me  
But your not looking  
I bet you would if only you knew  
You could make a difference  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street needing you  
I want to make it  
How can I get there?  
If you showed me that you cared, you know  
You could make the difference  
He's left to watch the world from the fifteenth floor  
Alone with the reminder, don't go out anymore  
You know those boys are trouble here in our neighborhood  
But you're my boy and you've got the chance to be something good  
Still the call of the streets was too much to ignore  
Now he's caught up in the game and can't find an open door  
He's a good boy gone bad and he's trying to get out  
But everybody's too afraid to hear what he's talking about  
Marcus Brown, lives a life much too old for his age  
If no one responds, he'll be words on a page  
Another statistic cause no calls were made  
To check on the boy who was missing from the fifth grade  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Everywhere you turn there's hurting people passing by  
Its such a shame that we could change a life but we don't try  
To look outside out world
