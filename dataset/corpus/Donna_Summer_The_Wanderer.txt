Woke up this morning  
Dragged myself across the bed  
Alice went to wonderland  
But I stayed home instead  
I started feeling bad  
'Cause I was left behind  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer  
  
She climbed right through the mirror  
Oh that really blew my mind  
I think I'll follow through her rhythm  
And her rhyme  
I know I'm ready now  
It's just a little time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I'm a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
Slipped down the back stair  
On my toes  
Then out the door  
They didn't hear  
Now they won't  
See me anymore  
'Cause I can't take  
That nine to five life  
It's a bore  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
And so it's up and out  
And on and off the road  
Won't have no troubles  
'Cause the whole world  
Is my home  
No need to worry  
'Cause I seldom am alone  
'Cause I'm wanderer  
I'm a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
Now you may see me  
Any time and any place  
And you may know me  
From the same look  
On your face  
And I don't know if I could  
Change your frame of mind  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time
