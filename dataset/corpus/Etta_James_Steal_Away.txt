Ooh, I gotta see you somehow  
Not tomorrow, but right now  
I know it's late, but honey don't make me wait  
So come on, baby, steal away  
Oh let's steal away  
  
Don't make me start thinking  
'Cause I might change my mind  
My folks are sleeping  
So please don't waste no time  
I know it's late but please don't make me wait  
So come on steal away  
Please let's steal away  
  
I know it's wrong, it's wrong needing you this way  
But there's no other way I can be with you  
If only my folks, if only my folks they would approve  
Things like this we wouldn't have to do  
  
Ooh I won't tell, I won't tell anybody else  
I'm gonna keep it, I'll keep it to myself  
I know it's late, but oh don't make me wait  
So come on and steal away  
Oh I'm asking you to steal away  
  
Because I need you, I need you by my side  
Oh I need you baby, I need you to be my guy  
Let's steal away right now  
Ooh...
