I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
  
I'm the class of 13  
In the era of dissent  
A hostage of the soul  
On a strike to pay the rent  
The last of the rebels  
Without a common ground  
I'm gonna light a fire  
Into the ground  
  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
  
I'm a nation  
Without bureaucratic ties  
Deny the allegation as it's written  
  
I want to take a ride to the great divide  
Beyond the "up to date"  
And the neo-gentrified  
The high definition or the low resident  
Where the value of your mind  
It's not held in contempt  
I can hear the sound of  
A beating heart  
And bleeds beyond a system  
That's falling apart  
With money to burn  
On a minimum wage  
'Cause I don't give a shit  
About the modern age  
  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
Mass hysteria  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
Mass hysteria  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
Mass hysteria  
I don't want to live in the modern world  
Mass hysteria
