I am my own believer  
In my heart the reason  
I will follow the light from within  
  
I'm not afraid of weakness  
I'm gonna taste the sweetness  
Of the power not to give in  
  
Oh I will see it through  
I believe this is the moment of truth  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
I have the strength to set my spirit free  
Dare to dream  
  
I will go the distance  
Embrace resistance  
And I will lay my soul on the line  
  
And when the way is over  
And our hunger has spoken  
If I'm with my own I will shine  
  
Oh I will see it through  
I believe this is my moment of truth  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
Dare to dream  
  
And my heart will shine like the sun  
A million voices together as one  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe  
  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
Find the strength to do what I believe  
Dare to dream, dare to dream
