I've loved you all my life in all my dreams  
So why am I surprised here with me  
That's how it should be  
But you look in my eyes, turn away  
You can see inside, I'm afraid  
Afraid of feeling.  
  
I don't know what to say  
I don't understand  
It's not the way I planned.  
  
I can't stay, I can't leave  
I'm torn between two people I need  
One of them is you, the other is me  
We come from different world, different stars  
But when you're lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do.  
  
How can I go on but nothing's changed  
You and I both know the choice was made  
When I first touched you  
Now if I stay or leave it's all the same  
Awake or in my dreams I see your face  
I will love you  
  
I'm always in control now here I stand  
A heart is in my hand  
  
I can't stay, I can't leave  
I'm torn between two people I need  
One of them is you, the other is me  
We come from different world, different stars  
But when you're lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do.
