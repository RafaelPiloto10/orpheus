Voices cryin' out, voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out in the night hear them call  
Voices cryin' out hear them call  
It's a night  
Like no other night  
It's a day  
Almost turning gray  
It's a heart  
Like a broken heart  
It's a wheel  
At the end of day  
It's the plight  
Of a boy who's scared  
Of the waves rushing out  
And the wind in the air  
It's the sight  
Of one longing to taste  
Of life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Visions that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
It's a song  
Of a love unsung  
It's the pain  
Of just being young  
It's a cry  
Of a voice unheard  
Of a face  
Speaking silent words  
It's the hope  
That the time goes by  
Take you upon a wing  
Teach your soul to fly  
It's a wish  
That you'll live your experience life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Oh do you know how it feels to be free  
Walking your path of life  
Embracing destiny one day at a time  
Voices cryin' out...oh can't you hear them  
Voices cryin' out...listen please, listen to the future  
Voices cryin' out...millions and millions and millions of voices  
Voices cryin' out...oh oh oh oh  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out...
