Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call  
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh  
  
You've nothing to say  
They're breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
The Mob Rules  
  
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same  
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh  
  
It's over, it's done  
the end is begun  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
  
You've nothing to say  
Oh, They're breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
  
Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground  
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around  
  
You're all fools!  
The Mob Rules!
