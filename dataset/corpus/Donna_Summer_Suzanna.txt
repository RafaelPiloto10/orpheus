Suzanna, you better watch your mouth  
Suzanna, bad things are coming out  
Somebody's watching from on high  
Distant love is hard to find  
  
Always looking for the right direction, oh yeah  
Move in and out without detection, yeah  
How many times have others gone and spoke their mind  
Out of line, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice  
  
Suzanna, Suzanna  
  
Suzanna, what's that look on your face  
Suzanna, girl you look out of place  
Somebody's watching from behind  
Don't tell them anything you find  
  
Wanna live your life without correction, yeah  
Move in and out looking for perfection, oh yeah  
How many times you've gone and spoken out your mind  
Out of line, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice  
  
Suzanna, Suzanna  
  
How many times you've been caught talking your jive  
How many times lives you've gone and ruined it's a crime, oh yeah  
It's a crime, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice  
  
Somebody's watching from behind  
Just be aware of what you find  
  
Suzanna  
Suzanna, what's that look on your face  
Suzanna, girl you look out of place  
Suzanna, what's that look on your face  
Suzanna, girl you look out of place
