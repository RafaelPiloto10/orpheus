A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
We'll catch a fox and put him in a box  
And then we'll let him go  
  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
We'll catch a fish and put him on a dish  
And then we'll let him go  
  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
We'll catch a bear and cut his hair  
And then we'll let him go  
  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
We'll catch a pig and dance a little jig  
And then we'll let him go  
  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go  
A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go  
We'll catch a giraffe and make him laugh  
And then we'll let him go
