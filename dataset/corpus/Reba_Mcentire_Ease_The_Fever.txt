No need talking  
I can't see it  
Someone set your heart on fire  
Now she's gone and all she left is hurt  
Lots of burning sweet desire  
  
[Chorus]  
So let me ease the fever and erase the pain  
Let me make a believer out of you again  
Hold me close and let me love the tears away  
Let me ease the fever and erase the pain  
  
Let your tears fall on my shoulder  
Let your arms around me tight  
Yesterday is gone forever  
Let's make tomorrow start tonight  
  
[Chorus: x3]
