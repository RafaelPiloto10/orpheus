Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn  
I wish that's how I felt  
I just can't hide the fool that I am  
As I let you walk away into the sunset  
It's just another famine  
I try to do the right thing  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown  
  
I made a mistake  
I got confused  
It's easy to forget  
'Cause this is real life  
With so much to lose  
When I let you walk away into the sunset  
I wasn't brokenhearted  
It'd be a happy ending but  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
And I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown  
No oh oh  
Tinseltown, oh  
Tinseltown, no oh oh  
Tinseltown  
  
I fell for the lines  
You knew that I would  
Hurray for Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown
