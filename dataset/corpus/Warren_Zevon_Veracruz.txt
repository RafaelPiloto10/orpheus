I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard Maria crying  
Late last night I heard the news  
That was dying  
Veracruz was dying  
Someone called Maria's name  
I swear it was my father's voice  
Saying, "If you stay you'll all be slain  
You must leave now - you have no choice  
Take the servants and ride west  
Keep the child close to your chest  
When the American troops withdraw  
Let Zapata take the rest"  
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard Maria calling  
Saying, "Veracruz is dying  
And Cuernavaca's falling"  
Aquel dia yo jure (On that day I swore  
Hacia el puerto volvere To the port I will return  
Aunque el destino cambio mi vida Even though destiny changed my life  
En morire In I shall die  
Aquel dia yo jure On that day I swore)  
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard them in the harbor  
Saying, "Veracruz is dying"
