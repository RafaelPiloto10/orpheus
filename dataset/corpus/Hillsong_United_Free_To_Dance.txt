This song in my heart, this song in my soul  
This song I was born to sing  
It's Your song of freedom, now I'm free to dance again  
  
I'll sing in the darkness, I'll laugh in the rain  
Rejoice in Your love again  
It's Your song of freedom, now I'm free to dance again  
  
Your Spirit brings me liberty  
Your breath of life has set me free  
  
Chorus:  
Jesus, Your love, it lifts me high  
Gives me reason to run the race with joy  
This song within me, Lord, will bless Your Holy name  
Jesus, I'll dance before Your throne  
Bring this heavenly sound to You alone  
This song within me. Lord, will bless Your Holy name
