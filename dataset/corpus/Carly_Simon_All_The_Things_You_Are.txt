Time and again I've longed for adventure,  
Something to make my heart beat the faster.  
What did I long for? I never really knew.  
Finding your love I've found my adventure,  
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,  
All that I want in all of this world is you.  
  
You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long.  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.  
You are the angel glow that lights a star,  
The dearest things I know are what you are.  
Some day my happy arms will hold you,  
And some day I'll know that moment divine,  
When all the things you are, are mine!
