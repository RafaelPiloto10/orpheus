(JADE)  
Daddy doesn't think  
That you'll be good enough for me  
Mama says be careful  
'Cause he'll break your heart in three  
They don't walk in my shoes,  
They ain't been kissed by you  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
My sister says  
She doesn't like the way you wear your hair  
But I know that she's jealous  
So why would I even care?  
I have to lie about how good you make me feel  
  
(PERRIE)  
So tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
(ALL)  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do  
  
(JESY)  
Talk is cheap and rumours spread  
But they go with the wind  
It's not about she said he said  
'Cause I know where it ends  
I know the real truth  
And the real truth is you  
  
(JADE)  
It's funny 'cause at times  
It feels like us against the world  
They treat you like a criminal  
But I'll still be your girl  
I'd rather die with you  
Walk the line if you asked me to  
  
(PERRIE)  
So tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
(ALL)  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do  
  
(JESY)  
L-L-Like I do, they just don't know you  
  
(ALL)  
You don't know about our love  
You choose what you see  
But if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
They don't know about the times  
When it's just him and me  
'Cause if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
  
Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do
