I can't tell you how it happened  
So I guess we'll never know  
I'm always late and running out of time  
So I must be very slow  
  
Someone must have smoked too much  
Or is it only dust  
My pals just tend to leave here in disgust  
  
My flat is a mess same as ever before  
My suits they stink like you don't want to know  
Junk to the left, trash to the right  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore  
  
When the postman rings I stay in bed  
I never make it down  
My fridge must be alive inside  
It's uttering funny sounds  
If I don't know what time it is  
I peek out if there's sun  
No use anyway, my money's gone  
  
My flat is a mess same as ever before  
My suits they stink like you don't want to know  
Junk to the left, trash to the right  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore
