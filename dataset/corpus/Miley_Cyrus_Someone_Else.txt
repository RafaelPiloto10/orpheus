If you're looking for love  
Know that love don't live here anymore  
He left with my heart  
They both walked through that door, without me  
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else  
'Cause I surely can't help you  
I'm hurting myself  
I've turned into someone else  
  
I used to believe love conquers all  
That's what seen in movies  
Come to find out it's not like that at all  
You see real life's much different  
  
I don't want to see you go  
Only want to see you smile  
It hurts so much just thinking of  
Felt like this for awhile  
I can't stand to see you there  
We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact  
That what we had could make us feel alive again  
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope  
Tell me that now is not the end

I used to believe love conquers all  
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me  
I thought you'd catch me if I fall  
And fill me up when I'm empty

Love is patient, love is selfless  
Love is hopeful, love is kind  
Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
Love is patient, love is selfless  
Love is hopeful, love is kind  
Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
Love is patient, love is selfless

Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
I've turned into someone else!
