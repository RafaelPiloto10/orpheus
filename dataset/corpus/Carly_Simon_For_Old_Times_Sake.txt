Let's make love for old times sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our hearts to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
Remember you as Mars  
And me as Venus  
Strange to see the grey in your hair  
And now feel a peace so deep between us  
And to realize that we still care  
  
Let's make love for old times sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our hearts to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
I used to think we would wind up together  
Our destinies always entwined  
Oh but your heart kept changing like the weather  
And you would up leaving me behind  
  
Let's make love for old time's sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our heart's to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
Let's make love for old time's sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our heart's to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake
