Spring is here, spring is here  
Life is skittles and life is beer  
I think the loveliest time of the year  
Is the spring, I do, don't you? Course you do  
But there's one thing that makes spring complete for me  
And makes every Sunday a treat for me  
  
All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon  
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
Every Sunday you'll see my sweetheart and me  
As we poison the pigeons in the park  
  
When they see us coming  
The birdies all try and hide  
But they still go for peanuts  
When coated with cyanide  
  
The sun's shining bright  
Everything seems all right  
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
We've gained notoriety  
And caused much anxiety  
In the Audobon Society  
With our games  
They call it impiety  
And lack of propriety  
And quite a variety of unpleasant names  
  
But it's not against any religion  
To want to dispose of a pigeon  
  
So if Sunday you're free  
Why don't you come with me  
And we'll poison the pigeons in the park  
And maybe we'll do in a squirrel or two  
While we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
We'll murder them amid laughter and merriment  
Except for the few we take home to experiment  
  
My pulse will be quickenin'  
With each drop of strychnine  
We feed to a pigeon  
It just takes a smidgin  
To poison a pigeon in the park
