I haven't lost anything except my mind  
Expect a thousand confessions that you will not find  
I try to take off my head sometimes,  
Because I can't escape the memories  
I haven't lost anything except my mind (except my mind)  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything,  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you.  
  
I haven't wasted anything except my time (except my time)  
Forget the treasures we burned because we'll be just fine  
I try to take off my head sometimes  
Because I can't escape for the life of me,  
I haven't lost anything except my mind (my mind)  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow,  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you  
  
Instead of going underground  
Instead of calling them out  
Instead of running 'cause your still breathing  
Instead of swallowing lies  
Instead of buried alive  
Let's twist the knife 'til they can't stop bleeding  
If you need a confession, I'm guilty  
Let's chase the knife 'til they can't stop bleeding  
Do you think I feel sorry? Forgive me.  
Let's chase the knife 'til they can't stop bleeding  
Instead of going underground  
Instead of calling them out  
Let's chase the knife 'til they can't stop bleeding  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you
