If I could stick my hand in my heart  
Spill it all over the stage  
Would it satisfy you  
Would it slide on by you  
Would you think the boy is strange  
Ain't it stra-a-ange  
  
If I could win  
If I could sing  
A love song so divine  
Would it be enough for your cheating heart  
If I broke down and cried  
If I cri-i-ied  
I said, "Ah no, It's only rock 'n' roll  
But I like it  
Ah no, it's only rock 'n' roll  
But I like it, like it  
Yes I do  
I really really really really do do-do do do"  
Hey  
  
Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields  
Sold in a market down in New Orleans  
Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' all right  
Hear they whip the women just around midnight  
  
Brown sugar  
How come you taste so good  
Brown sugar  
Just like a young girl should  
  
I saw her today at the reception  
A glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
By her feet was a footloose man  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You might find  
You get what you need  
  
You need honkey tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honkey tonk blues  
  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once had me down  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once pushed me around  
It's down to me  
Yes it is  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me  
The change has come  
She's under my thumb  
  
So, goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still, I'm gonna miss you  
  
Who who who who who-who who who who who who-who who who who-who  
Who who who who who-who who who who who who-who who who who-who  
  
Please allow me to introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste (woo woo)  
I've been around for a long long year  
So many a man sold a faith (woo woo)  
Pleased to meet you (woo woo)  
Hope you guessed (woo woo) my name (woo woo woo woo)  
Cause what's bothering you (woo woo)  
Is the nature (woo woo) of my game (woo woo woo woo)  
  
I said, "Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!  
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!  
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!  
Don't hang around because two's a crowd  
  
Shay-do-bay(?), shatter, shay-do-bay(?), shatter  
  
Laughter, joy, and loneliness  
And sex and sex and sex and sex  
Look at me  
I'm in tatters  
Shay-do-bay(?), I'm shattered  
Shay-do-bay(?), shatter  
  
This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my  
Let's spend the night together  
No excuses offered anyway, oh my  
Let's spend the night together  
I'll satisfy your every need (every need)  
And I know you'll satisfy me  
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-my  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need you more than ever  
Let's spend the night together now  
Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma ma ma my  
  
I can't get no  
Satisfaction  
I can't get no  
Girlie action  
Cause I try (and I try) and I try (and I try)  
And I try (and I try) and I try (and I try)  
I can't get no  
I can't get no  
I can't get no  
Satisfaction  
Satisfaction  
Satisfaction  
Satisfaction
