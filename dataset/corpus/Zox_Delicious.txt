What a difference a day makes  
Silence so delicious on days like these  
And by the time that my resolve breaks  
Well I've already found the beauty down on my knees  
You know I want to be something  
Don't ever want to be someone new  
Some people telling me one thing  
But I know if I fall I'll hold on to you  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room  
  
I've got the strength for believing  
And life is so contagious in times like these  
You might say it's the season  
You lift me up if I ask you please  
Hey, Hey  
I got a heart for intentions and I  
not always sure where they gonna go  
Lead you in different direction  
I can change your life if you let me grow  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way (way way) it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room  
  
(Go, Go)  
  
(Yeah)  
  
What a difference a day makes  
Oh silence so delicious on days like these  
And by the time that my resolve breaks  
Well I've already found the beauty down on my knees  
You know I want to be something  
I never want to be someone new  
Some people telling me one thing  
But I know if I fall I'll hold on to you  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way (way way) it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room
