These are the original ones:  
See the way she walks down the street?  
Watch the way she shuffles her feet.  
May she holds her head up high as she goes walking bye.  
  
And she throws her hands out so fast.  
And she's not just one of the pack.  
My baby always the one to try the things they've never done.  
And just because of that they're saying:  
  
She's a rebel and she'll never be any good.  
She's a rebel 'cause she never, never does what she should.  
And just because she doesn't do, what everybody else does.  
That's the reason why I can give her all my love.
