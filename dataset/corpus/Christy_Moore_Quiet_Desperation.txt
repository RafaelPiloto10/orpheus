My soul is in the mountains  
My heart is in the land  
I'm lost here in the city  
There's so much I don't understand  
  
There's quiet desperation comin' over me  
Comin' over me  
  
I've got to leave I can't stay another day  
There's an emptiness inside of me  
I can't bear the loneliness out here  
There's another place I've got to be  
  
I long for you Dakota  
Smell of sweet grass on the plain  
I see too much meanness  
And I feel too much pain  
  
There's quiet desperation comin' over me  
Comin' over me  
  
I've got to leave I can't stay another day  
There's an emptiness inside of me  
I can't bear the loneliness out here  
There's another place I've got to be
