O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of angels  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord  
  
God of God  
Light of light  
Lo, he abhors not the Virgin's womb  
Very God begotten, not created  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord  
  
Yea, Lord, we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
Jesus, to thee be all glory given  
Son of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord  
  
O come, let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord  
(O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant)  
Christ the Lord, the Lord!
