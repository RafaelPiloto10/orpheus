It's a gone dead train  
Yes, it's a gone dead train  
  
My engine was pumpin' steam  
And I was grindin' at you hard and fast  
Burnin' down the rails, tryin' to heat the way  
Haulin' ass and ridin' up the track  
And I laughed at the conductor who was tellin' me my coal  
It would never last  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
Ain't no empty cellar  
Like a gone dead train  
  
Once was at a time when I could  
Mama shave 'em dry  
And raise a fever ice-down chill  
Waitin' at the station  
With a heavy loaded sack  
Savin' up and holdin' just to spill  
Shootin' my supply through my demon's eye  
Instead of holdin' my time, I hope I will  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
There ain't no empty cellar  
Needs a gone dead train  
  
Yes it's a gone dead train  
I'm gonna teach it to learn now, now  
It's a gone dead train  
Yes it's a gone dead train  
I'm gonna teach it to learn now, now  
It's a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it, gonna teach it to learn  
  
There ain't no easy day  
When your daily run's a downhill pull  
And there ain't no easy way  
Wishin' for some jelly roll  
There ain't no switch been made  
To make your juicy lemon find  
A spring to run a dry well full  
  
But then the fire in my boiler  
Up and quit before I came  
Ain't no empty cellar  
Needs a gone dead train  
  
Yes it's a gone dead train  
I'm gonna teach it to learn  
You know it's a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it, gonna teach it to burn  
It's a gone dead train  
It's a gone dead train, you gotta learn  
It's a gone dead train  
Gonna teach it, gonna teach it, gonna teach it to burn.
