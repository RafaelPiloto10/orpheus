I've been wondering what's eating at your head?  
The cheap way you handle things, the slander that you spread.  
Making misery is the way you spend your time.  
I think it's safe to say when it comes to truth you're blind  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life  
  
The faces that you show have everyone concerned.  
But if they turn their backs to you, trust in you,  
They'll learn.  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life
