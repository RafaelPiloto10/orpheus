The color of my blade is red  
Remember what you said  
Perfection is killing the freaks yeah  
Even as we speak yeah  
Don't you  
Now it was decided the war  
The silence will rise to a shout yeah  
You told us we'd see it through  
The practical joker police came  
To knock down doors and to leave blame  
I remember what you told them  
The color of my blade is golden  
They didn't come back anymore  
You should've decided to lay it out on the floor  
Be sure to instruct them to leave you  
Cause they no longer would believe you  
It's worthless to you through  
Don't you come back anymore
