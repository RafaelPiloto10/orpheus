Spiderman, spiderman  
Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web, any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong, listen bud  
He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.
