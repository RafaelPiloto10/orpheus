College Kids turning twenty-one  
and their senior year spring break was here  
they headed south but not for sun  
On their skin where the storms had been  
It was hard  
fixing windows and shigles and doors  
and the tide never felt so good before  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyday People are the ones who are making miracles  
and it's beautiful  
Everyday People lifting up the world  
like an answered prayer  
I thank God their there  
They're the one's who care  
Everyday People  
  
Doctor said "Good News we caught it soon enough, we can clear this up"  
But she's 30 and single with two kids to raise  
times are tough these days  
So her friends made some calls and the word spread around  
How her bills got paid she don't know how  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A little girl takes her Mama's hand  
and walks inside saying "Please don't cry"  
As the people who built this house just for them  
Laugh through the tears as a family moves in  
  
Everyday People are the ones who are making miracles  
and it's beautiful  
Everyday People lifting up the world  
like an answered prayer  
I thank God their there  
They're the one's who care  
Everyday people, everyday people, everyday people
