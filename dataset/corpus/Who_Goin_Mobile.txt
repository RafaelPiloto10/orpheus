I'm goin' home  
And when I want to go home  
I'm goin' mobile  
Well, I'm gonna find a home  
And we'll see how it feels  
Goin' mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
I can pull up by the curb  
I can make it on the road  
Goin' mobile  
I can stop in any street  
And talk with people that we meet  
Goin' mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
Out in the woods  
Or in the city  
It's all the same to me  
When I'm drivin' free, the world's my home  
When I'm mobile  
  
Hee, hoo!  
beep beep!  
  
Play the tape machine  
Make the toast and tea  
When I'm mobile  
Well I can lay in bed  
With only highway ahead  
When I'm mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
Keep me movin'  
Over 50  
Keep me groovin'  
Just a hippie gypsy  
  
Come on move now  
Movin'  
Keep me movin', yeah  
  
Keep me movin', groovin', groovin', yeah  
Movin', Yeah  
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, ...  
  
I don't care about pollution  
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy  
That's my solution  
Watch the police and the tax man miss me  
I'm mobile  
Oooooh, yeah, hee!  
  
Mobile, mobile, mobile yeah
