Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above, don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love, don't fence me in.  
Oh let me be by myself in the evening breeze,  
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,  
Send me off forever but I ask you please, don't fence me in.  
  
Just turn me loose and I'll straddle on my saddle underneath the western
skies.  
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise.  
Oh let me ride to the ridge where the west commences,  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses,  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences, don't fence me in.
