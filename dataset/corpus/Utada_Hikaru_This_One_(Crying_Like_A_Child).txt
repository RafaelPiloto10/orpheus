How can I put this I I I  
I'm an independent woman, I,  
I've been crying like a child  
I just wanted you to know the person that I am  
More than any other your fans  
I would love you for a thousand years  
Yours truly  
  
I ain't gonna play it cool  
Let me tell you I've tried that  
Already  
Every day, and every night, your words  
Ring through me  
Who am I trying to fool, honey I've been living on my own  
like Freddy  
But I'm still a woman, baby tell me how  
  
How could I ever love another?  
How could you say you don't remember?  
God knows I'd give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today I'll miss you more than ever  
How could you say you don't remember?  
This one's for the happiness I'll be wishing you forever  
  
It's just another Friday night  
For you and your accessory  
And there you are before my eyes  
Two hours and for fifteen minutes you are here  
I don't wanna scream lest I should tear  
A whisper in the darkness disappears  
Sincerely  
  
We should get back on the road  
Like Simon and Garfunkel  
Let's get married  
You were all the shelter that I need above me  
Who am I trying to fool  
Honey I've got your ring tone on my  
Blackberry  
And I won't give a damn if only I knew how  
  
How could I ever love another?  
How could you say you don't remember?  
God knows I'd give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today I'll miss you more than ever  
How could you say you don't remember?  
This one's for the happiness I'll be wishing you forever  
  
You got me crying like a child  
Ain't no need for me to lie  
A hundred j-peg files fillin' up my herd-drive  
You got me crying like a child  
And the crowd is going wild  
This one, this is the one  
Come on and give it up  
  
How could I ever love another?  
How could you say you don't remember?  
God knows I'd give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today I'll miss you more than ever  
How could you say you don't remember?  
This one's for the happiness I'll be wishing you forever  
  
How could I ever love another?  
How could you say you don't remember?  
God knows I'd give anything  
For just one more night together  
Today I'll miss you more than ever  
How could you say you don't remember?  
This one's for the happiness I'll be wishing you forever
