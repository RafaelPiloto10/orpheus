To all the killers and a hundred dollar billas  
For real dealers that ain't got no feelings  
Check it out now  
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous, you heard of us  
Official White folks murderers  
My mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware  
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share  
For all those who wanna profile and pose  
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone  
You all alone in these streets, cousin  
Every man for their self in this land, we be gunnin'  
And keep them shook crews runnin' like they supposed to  
They come around but they never come close to  
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place  
Cowards like you just get their whole body laced up  
With bullet holes and such  
Speak to wrong words man and you will get touched  
You could put your whole army against my team  
And I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'  
Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major  
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player  
Don't make me have to call your name out  
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate  
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old  
And when the things get for realm my warm heart turns cold  
Another figga deceased, another story gets told  
It ain't nothin' really, hey, yo dun spark the Phillie  
So I can get my mind off these yellow backed niggas  
Why they still alive, I don't know, go figure  
Meanwhile back in L.A., the foundation  
If I had to die, couldn't choose a better location  
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation  
Getting closer to God in a tight situation  
Now, take these words home and think it through  
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you  
Son, they shook 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death and scared to look  
You shook, there's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death and scared to look  
You shook 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look  
You shook, there's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death and scared to look  
Livin' the life with the diamonds and guns  
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds  
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns  
Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones  
You ain't a crook son, you just a shook one  
There's a war goin' on outside, no man is safe from  
You can run but you can't hide forever  
In these streets that we done took  
You walking with your head down scared to look  
You shook 'cause there ain't no such thing as half way crooks  
There never around when the beef cooks  
And my part of town is similar to Vietnam  
Now we all grown up and hold heavy on the cops control  
You better have the right gear ready  
Tryin' back me and get rock steady  
By the mac one double, I'll touch you  
Leave you with not much to go home with  
My skin is thick 'cause I be up in the mix of action  
If I'm not at home puffin', lie, relaxin', I lay got a nigga depress  
So I wear a stuff [Incomprehensible] underneath my gest  
In the life filled with diamonds and guns  
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds  
But some get shot, locked down and turn nuns  
Cowardly hearts say straight up, shook ones  
You shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
Just shook one  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
Just shook one
