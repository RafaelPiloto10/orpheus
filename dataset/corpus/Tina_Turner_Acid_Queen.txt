If your child ain't all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
I'll show him what he could be now  
Just give me one night  
  
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
I'm the gypsy and I'm guaranteed  
To mend his aching heart  
  
Give us a room, close the door  
Leave us for a while  
You won't be a boy no more  
Young, but not a child  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed  
  
To tear your soul apart  
  
Gather your wits and hold them fast  
Your mind must learn to roam  
Just as the gypsy queen must do  
You're gonna hit the road  
  
My work's been done, now look at him  
He's never been more alive  
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch  
Watch his body writhe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To break your little heart  
  
If your child ain't all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
I'll show him what he could be now  
Just give me one more night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To tear your soul apart
