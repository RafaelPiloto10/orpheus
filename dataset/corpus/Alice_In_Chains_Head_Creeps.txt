  
  
  
No more time  
Just one more time  
So crazy, beat the strain  
Too lazy, shake the gray  
So, and she willed the rain  
So let me be defamed  
Your redundancy stains  
Tired of infantile claims  
Like puppets on a string  
Untangle you from me  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again  
Slapped in the face again  
No more time  
Just one more time  
Your redundancy stains  
Tired of infantile claims  
Like puppets on a string  
Untangle you from me  
So crazy, beat the strain  
Too lazy, shake the gray  
So, and she willed the rain  
So let me be defamed  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again  
Slapped in the face again  
One day my plane leaves  
Some way my head creeps  
Some day my head leads  
Some way my head creeps  
No more time  
Just one more time  
Empty room sets the scene  
Pick at me slow, pain fiend  
Suck me through barbed screen  
Anger becomes our queen  
Tongue whipping forked black  
How long until you crack  
Surprised and set back  
Lackeys' loose talk for fact  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again (2x)  
Slapped in the face again  
One day my plane leaves  
Some way my head creeps  
Some day my head leads  
Some way my head creeps  
Creeps  
No more time  
Just one more time  
So crazy feel the hate  
Yeah, I've got years to wait  
I know it's not too late  
Lending clean hands of fate  
Rise from the dirt I'm in  
Hide in another's skin  
Stick black dress doll with pin  
Your mouth takes on my grin  
So crazy (3x)
