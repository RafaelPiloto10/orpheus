I am walking through Rome  
With my heart on a string  
Dear God, please help me  
  
And I am so very tired  
Of doing the right thing  
Dear God, please help me  
  
There are explosive kegs  
Between my legs  
Dear God, please help me  
  
Will you follow and know  
Know me more than you do  
Track me down  
And try to win me?  
  
Then he motions to me  
With his hand on my knee  
Dear God, did this kind of thing happen to you?  
  
Now I'm spreading your legs  
With mine in-between  
Dear God, if I could I would help you  
  
And now I am walking through Rome  
And there is no room to move  
But the heart feels free  
  
The heart feels free  
The heart feels free  
But the heart...feels free  
  
The heart feels free  
The heart feels free
