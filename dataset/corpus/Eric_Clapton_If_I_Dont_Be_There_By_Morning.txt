Blue sky upon the horizon,  
Private eye is on my trail,  
And if I don't be there by morning  
You know that I must have spent the night in jail.  
  
I've been running from Memphis to L. A.  
Had an appointment set sometime for today,  
And if I don't be there by morning  
You know that I must have gone the other way.  
  
Finding my way back to you girl,  
Lonely and blue and mistreated too.  
Sometimes I think of you girl,  
Is it true that you think of me too?  
  
I got a woman living in L. A.  
I got a woman waiting for my pay,  
And if I don't be there by morning,  
Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill.  
I left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still.  
If I don't be there by morning  
You know that I, I never will.
