Where are the dreams that we once had?  
This is the time to bring them back.  
What were the promises,  
Caught on the tips of our tongues?  
  
Do we forget or forgive?  
There's a whole other life waiting to live when,  
One day we're brave enough  
To talk with conviction of the heart.  
  
And down your streets I've walked alone,  
As if my feet were not my own,  
Such is the path I chose,  
Doors I have opened and closed.  
  
I'm tired of living this lie,  
Fooling myself, believing we're right when,  
I've never given love,  
With any conviction of the heart.  
  
One with the Earth, with the sky, one with everything in life,  
I believe, we'll survive, if we only try.  
  
How long must we all wait to change,  
This world bound in chains that we live in,  
To know what it is to forgive,  
And be forgiven?  
  
It's been too many years of talking now.  
Isn't it time to stop somehow?  
Air that's too angry to breathe, water our children can't drink  
You've heard it hundreds of times  
  
You say you're aware,  
Believe and you care,  
But do you care enough,  
Where's your conviction of the heart?
