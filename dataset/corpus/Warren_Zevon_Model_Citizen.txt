Don't bring the milk in  
Leave it on the porch  
Don't read the papers  
Don't mow the lawn no more  
Drive to the market  
At the break of dawn  
Watch 'em unload the produce  
Then ride right back home  
  
[CHORUS]  
It's the white man's burden  
And it weighs a ton  
I'm a family man  
Model citizen  
Tormen the mailman  
Terrorize the maid  
Try to teach 'em some manners  
Whip 'em into shape  
Down in the basement  
I've got a Craftsman lathe  
Show it to the children  
When they misbehave  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a law-abiding man  
I'm a good Samaritan  
I pay my taxes when I can  
Model citizen  
In the cool of the evening  
When the sun goes down  
My wife's playing canasta  
With everyone in town  
When I feel the pressure  
And I need a break  
Load up the Winnebago  
Drive it in the lake  
  
[CHORUS]
