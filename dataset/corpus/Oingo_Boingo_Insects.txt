Tiny insects in my hair  
Tiny insects everywhere  
Tiny insects in my pants  
Watching insects make romance  
Insects make me make me want to dance dance dance  
They make want to dance . . .  
Flying insects everywhere  
Flying insects buzzing buzzing buzzing through the air  
Just like little diamonds in the sky  
Insects buzzing in my eye  
Buzzing insects make me want to dance dance dance  
They make me want to dance . . .  
Insects crawling all around  
Insects squirming in the ground  
Insects gooey squeaky chewy  
Should I eat them--no  
I'd rather stomp them hurt them stomp  
Stomp them while I dance dance dance  
I hurt them while I dance dance dance  
I stomp them while I dance dance dance . . .  
Insects make me scream and shout  
They don't know what life's about  
They don't have blood  
They've got too many legs  
They don't have brains in their heads  
They know they'll rule the world some day  
They bite and sting me anyway  
They bite and sting and suck  
They bite and sting and suck suck suck  
They bite and sting and  
Suck suck suck suck suck . . .  
Dance dance dance
