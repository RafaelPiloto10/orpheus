And the band began to play, without a song they'd lose their way  
A song of love and custom dreams, a song of yesterday  
When they danced, when they danced, her skirts were lifted high  
She felt the music in his arms, the danger in his eyes  
And a woman said no, and a man said "but I love you so"  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said "Take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side"  
  
It happened all too fast, they came to love and they came to last  
No-one remembers now who lied, true love is made of glass  
And a woman said "change", and a man said "as soon as I can"  
And a woman said "open up", and a man said  
"Your way's right, you're my love, I won't be holdin' you down"  
  
In the evening of their lives, no regrets and clear blue skies  
They meet again in old New York, he tells her one sweet lie  
  
And they danced and they danced, and a man said "I love you so"  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said "take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side"
