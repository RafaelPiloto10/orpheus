It was a cold, cold house,  
I was a cold, cold room.  
No one lived in me.  
I was an empty tune.  
Lovers came to view  
'n' they looked all around.  
But they couldn't see nothin',  
Nothin but the ground, they really put me down  
And then someone broke  
Inside of me  
And i found myself learnin'  
How to fight free.  
  
And it feels so good  
When i can turn to you  
'n' look you straight in the eye,  
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over and over, over again.  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i got you up my brain  
Over, over, over again.  
  
You know it hurts so bad  
When you have to say  
You ain't got nobody  
And then one day  
It makes you feel so good  
When i can turn to you  
And look you straight in the eye,  
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i want to hear your name  
Over and over, over again.  
I need your love,  
Oh how i need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over, over, over again, yeah.  
I need your love, baby  
I need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over, over, over again.
