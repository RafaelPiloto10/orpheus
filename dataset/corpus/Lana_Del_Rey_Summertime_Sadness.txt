Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you're the best  
  
I got my red dress on tonight  
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight  
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style  
High heels off, I'm feeling alive  
  
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above all sizzlin' like your stare  
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere  
Nothing scares me anymore  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you're the best  
  
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Oh, oh  
  
I'm feelin' electric tonight  
Cruising down the coast goin' by 99  
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side  
Oh if I go, I'll die happy tonight  
  
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above all sizzlin' like your stare  
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere  
Nothing scares me anymore  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you're the best  
  
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Oh, oh  
  
I think I'll miss you forever  
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies  
Late is better than never  
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive  
  
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Oh, oh  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you're the best  
  
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Oh, oh
