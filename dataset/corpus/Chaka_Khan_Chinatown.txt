Yin yang  
A feeling's evolving through me  
Sweet and sour  
Is the taste you bring  
  
When I said goodbye, you loved me  
When I turned to you, you turned away  
When I was so gung-ho  
He said "let me go"  
  
He begged me to stay, stay, stay  
If I try to find out what's on your mind  
I'll find out in Chinatown  
  
[Chorus]  
Chinatown  
I don't know how to read you  
Upside down  
The signs will all mislead you  
Like this town  
you're such a mystery to me  
Chinatown  
I don't know how to read you  
Upside down  
The signs will all mislead you  
  
I'll track you down  
And you'll go crazy for me  
So much smoke I can't get through to you  
Eyes that I can't see  
  
They stare me down  
Here I'm chasin' you  
Some crazy Fu Manchu  
And it feels so wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
  
When I try to find out what's on your mind  
I'll find out in Chinatown  
  
[Chorus]
