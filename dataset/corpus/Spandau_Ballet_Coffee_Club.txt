Matthew didn't stay home, he went abroad instead  
Journeys to glory breathing in his head  
Got caught up with shoe horns but he couldn't get a shine  
Matthew bought the rap and read the map without a sign  
Contort yourself on disco  
With a rap trap white and brown  
Caught within the spinning  
The key chain gang went down  
No coffee club will have the rub  
When product is your answer  
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan  
It's deep within the dancer  
Wear it on your back now and summarize your vision on the train  
And through the strain, your own soul decision  
Well, she had a certain shimmer, she sleeps with him tonight  
Stifled love decides where I'm dreaming  
No coffee club will have the rub  
When product is your answer  
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan  
It's deep within the dancer
