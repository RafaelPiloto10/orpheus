Feelin's, just lead us on  
Till we know where we're goin' mhmm.  
  
If I told you that I loved you  
Could we slip away where the lights're low  
And if I put my arms around you  
And held you close could you tell me no  
Well, you know that I'd be lyin'  
If I said I was a tryin', to let you know, I'd go.  
  
Yes, love take me where we've never been before  
Feelin's, just lead us on  
Till we know where we're goin' mhmm.  
  
You don't know how long I wanted  
To have you where you are right now  
With you looking soft and pretty  
Ain't no telling where we've found.  
Now, here we are together  
Too close with talkin', I can't tell you no.  
  
Yes, love take us where we've never been before  
Feelin's, just lead us on  
Till we know where we're goin' mhmm.  
  
Feelin's, mhmm, feelin's...
