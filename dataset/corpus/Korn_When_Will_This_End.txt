Spinning inside rotting away  
Something inside of me has been taken away  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It won't get better now  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?  
  
Hopeless inside alone as I wait  
Brewing inside of me enduring this hate  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It won't get better now  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?  
  
The stress is rising and I can't seem to get away from you  
You're always trying and the lying always shines right through  
My God I hate this  
Always take shit  
Can I let this go on?  
Why can't I break this  
I just take this  
As this goes on and on  
  
End  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?
