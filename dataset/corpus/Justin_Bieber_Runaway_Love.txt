You see my baby up and hit the road  
Where she's going, that's where nobody knows  
I need to find her before another man does  
I wouldn't want him to steal my love  
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool (Cool, cool, cool)  
Whatcha expect me to do (oh oh oh yeah)  
  
I'm just trying to find, find, find, sweet love of mine  
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?  
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up  
I'd give it all up for us (never be enough)  
(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love  
  
See my baby really needs some help  
'Cause she can never stay at home by herself  
She says she needs a little company  
Even if she's not always with me yeah, oh oh  
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool (trying to be cool)  
Whatcha expect me to do (oh yeah)  
I'm just trying to find, find, find, the sweet love of mine  
  
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?  
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up  
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)  
(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love  
Why can't I find (why can't I find) the love of mine  
When you're standing in front of my face  
Oh, I must be blind, how did I let you get away? (yeah, yeah)  
  
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?  
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up  
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)  
(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love
