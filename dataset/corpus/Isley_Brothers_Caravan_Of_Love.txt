Ooh...ooh...ooh..  
Ooh...ooh...ooh..  
  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
It's time to stand up and fight  
(It's alright) It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)  
Hand in hand we'll take a caravan  
To the motherland  
  
One by one we're gonna stand with the pride  
One that can't be denied  
(Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up)  
From the highest mountain and valley low  
We'll join together with hearts of gold  
  
Now the children of the world can see  
There's a better way for us to be  
The place where mankind was born  
Is so neglected and torn, torn apart  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
  
We'll be living in a world of peace  
In a day when everyone is free  
We'll bring the young and the old  
Won't you let your love flow from your heart  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
  
Now the children of the world can see  
There's a better for us to be  
The place where mankind was born  
Is so neglected and torn, torn apart  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
  
Come go with me  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
Come go with me  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready)  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready)
