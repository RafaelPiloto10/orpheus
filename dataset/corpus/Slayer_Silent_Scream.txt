Nightmare, the persecution  
A child's dream of death.  
  
Torment, ill forgotten  
A soul that will never rest.  
  
Guidance, it means nothing  
In a world of brutal time.  
  
Electric, circus, wild,  
Deep in the infants mind.  
  
Silent Scream  
Bury the unwanted child.  
Beaten and torn  
Sacrifice the unborn.  
  
Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]  
Bearer of no name.  
  
Restrained, insane games  
Suffer the children condemned.  
  
Scattered, remnants of life,  
Murder a time to die.  
  
Pain, sufferaged toyed,  
Life's little fragments destroyed.  
  
Silent Scream  
Crucify the bastard son.  
Beaten and torn  
Sanctify lives of scorn.  
  
Life preordained  
Humanity maintained.  
Extraction termination  
Pain's agonizing stain.  
  
Embryonic death,  
Embedded in your brain.  
Suffocation, strangulation,  
Death is fucking you insane.  
  
Nightmare, the persecution  
A child's dream of death.  
  
Torment, ill forgotten  
A soul that will never rest.  
Innocence withdrawn in fear.  
Fires burning can you hear  
Cries in the night.
