Please go away,  
Leave me alone.  
To you I have nothing to say,  
My voice has no tone.  
  
I'd rather be there,  
Because you're here.  
Whatever, I don't care,  
Because of you there was a tear.  
  
No one cares about me,  
No one needs me.  
But don't you see,  
I do whatever you do to me.  
  
Do you hate me,  
'cause I know I hate you.  
That's why I want you to stay away from me,  
You weren't the only one that I knew.  
  
Don't try to touch my feelings.  
Don't try to see what's on my mind.  
'cause the last thing I'd do is let you  
Back in my life. I despise you...
