Trying to press, what you might be feeling  
Why suppress, what you might be needing  
  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
You were lying in your sink  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
Cause you don't mean anything to anyone anymore  
  
Why confess, well you wouldn't need to  
Because on your desk, there's more to be seen to  
  
By the time just keep on ticking  
Until I get my sweet release  
By the time just keep on winding  
Until this cold-stop has ceased  
And everyone can see the sun  
  
I've send underwater, slept with your daughter  
She told me what your rule book read  
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter  
So won't you let me have my head  
And then I can see the sun  
  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
You were lying in your sink  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
Because you don't mean anything to anyone, anymore  
  
By the time just keep on ticking  
Until I get my sweet release  
And down this road I'll keep on winding  
Until this cold-stop has ceased  
And everyone can see the sun  
  
Everyone can see the sun  
Everyone can see the sun  
Everyone can see the sun  
  
I've send underwater, slept with your daughter  
She told me what your rule book read  
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter  
So won't you let me have my head  
And then I can see the sun
