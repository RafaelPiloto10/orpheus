[Chorus: x2]  
There can only be one me(can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me)  
  
I wanna make you moan  
Do it all night long  
Once I get you home  
Baby girl it's on  
I'm gonna kiss yo lips  
Then I'm gonna raise yo slip  
I'm gonna take your hand  
And let you feel these ribs  
I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?-  
I'm a winner in bed  
Go to dinner?-, go to dinner?-, go to dinner?-  
Go to dinner in bed  
Listen babe,  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I wanna show you love  
From the bottom up  
Once the light goes off  
You can't get enough  
I wanna be yo man  
Not a one night stand  
And if you take my hand  
I bet 1 hundred grand  
I'm a winner? I'm a winner? I'm a winner?  
I'm a winner in bed, yes I am  
Go to dinner? go to dinner? go to dinner?  
And the dinner in bed, there can only be?-  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Girl open your dictionary look under love  
And your gonna see my face  
Come to bed right now lets cover up  
Nothin' but sweat comin' between us in this place  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be?-  
Wanna be with me tonight  
Do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see?-  
How I'm gonna do yo body right  
Do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go?-  
Go on a 12 play ride  
You'll be goin' all out  
Like a prom night  
And you won't make it home  
Cause you realize  
  
[Chorus: x8]
