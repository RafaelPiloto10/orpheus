Clearing webs from the hovel  
A blistered hand on the handle of a shovel  
I've been digging too deep, I always do.  
I see my fate on the surface  
I look a lot like Narcissus  
A dark abyss of an emptiness  
Standing on the edge of a drowning blue.  
  
I look behind my ears for the green  
Even my sweat smells clean  
Glare off the white hurts my eyes.  
Gotta get out of bed get a hammer and a nail  
Learn how to use my hands, not just my head  
I think myself into jail  
Now I know a refuge never grows  
From a chin in a hand in a thoughtful pose  
Gotta tend the earth if you want a rose.  
  
I had a lot of good intentions  
Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension,  
Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts  
But my life is more than a vision  
The sweetest part is acting after making a decision  
I started seeing the whole as a sum of its parts  
  
My life is part of the global life  
I'd found myself becoming more immobile  
When I'd think a little girl in the world can't do anything.  
A distant nation my community  
A street person my responsibility  
If I have a care in the world I have a gift to bring.
