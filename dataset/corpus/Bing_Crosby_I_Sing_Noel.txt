Some children see Him lily white  
The baby Jesus born this night  
Some children see Him lily white  
With dresses of their faith  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all little children who have no Christmas tree  
I sing Noel, Noel, Noel  
For little girls who have no pretty dress to wear  
Little boys who have no teddy bears  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all lonely children who cry on Christmas Eve  
I sing Noel, Noel, Noel  
For little girls whose hands are trembling in the cold  
Little boys whose eyes are too slow  
May the new born Savior  
Turn His tender face to you  
May He help us all  
To make this world a better place for you  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all little children who have no Christmas tree  
Let's all sing Noel, rings the bells of Christmas  
For all lonely children wherever they may be  
Noel, Noel, come spend Christmas with me  
Noel, Noel, come spend Christmas with me  
I sing Noel  
I sing Noel  
I sing Noel
