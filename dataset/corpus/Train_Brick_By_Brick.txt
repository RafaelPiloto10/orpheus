The dust has finally settled down  
The sun is shining on  
These pieces that are scattered all around  
This house was everything we knew  
It's where we kept our love  
And every single memory of me and you  
Every letter, every note,  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold onto each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We will get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.  
  
The sky has made it back to blue,  
Everything that's left  
Is telling us the worst of it is through.  
Home has never felt so right,  
There's nothing in the way.  
There's nothing in between us  
Knowing where we're going is inside.  
Every letter that I wrote,  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold on to each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We'll get back to yesterday.  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away.  
  
All the pictures that we've taken  
And the songs that we have played  
That have all kept track and  
Followed back the love that we have made.  
Now they're spread out on the surface  
Where we can try to congregate  
It's not too late,  
To believe that we can get it all again  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor,  
If we hold onto each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We'll get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.  
  
Brick by brick  
We'll get back to yesterday,  
When I made your body shiver and  
When you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.
