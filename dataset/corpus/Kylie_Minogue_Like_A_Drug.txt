Boy, ya, you got it, got it  
You got me feelin' crazy 'bout my body  
I, I cannot cannot stop it  
You got Me movin', got me rockin' rockin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Make me feel like I can make it real  
You got me hooked, gettin' me on the floor  
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dance like I'm the only, only  
Like I'm the only lady, like you want me  
Damn right, I have my radar on you  
So let's get physical, I want to, want to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
When we rock, when we rock  
I really wanna do, everything with you  
The things you make me do, like a drug, like a drug  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
I really wanna do, everything with you  
The things you make me do  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug
