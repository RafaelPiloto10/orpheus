Let's all make babies  
And salsa from Sainsbury's  
'Cause this is a Happy Song  
Play on my pink flute  
But make it through Beirut  
'Cause this is a happy song  
  
You need a mood maker  
Then go meet my tailor  
I know it's going too fast  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Is getting on with it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah ( debonair )  
I'm feeling so debonair ('cause I care )  
Send you my love 'cause I care (it's a love song )  
This is a love song  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
Goose step through Gangland  
And drive Chitty Ban Bang  
'Cause this is a happy song  
Bosnians and Kurds  
Back with some big bird  
Who's singing a happy song  
  
Fly in the sunshine  
Get there at your own time  
You tell us if I'm in Hong Kong  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Just singing a happy song  
  
[Chorus :]  
  
Happy Song  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
  
Yeah (debonair)  
I'm feeling so debonair (in the air)  
Everything's up in the air (from Jamaica)  
Tease me from bedtime  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
[Chorus :]  
This is a happy song
