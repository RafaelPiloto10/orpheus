I see a lion captive in the kitchen  
Rolling thunder rumbles down the hall  
Once in awhile, everyone paces the floor  
Lately, it's more and more  
Love, if yu must be started go easily on your way  
Still I wonder could it wait another day?  
Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?  
Is the answer just another road to go?  
Does it have to leave to be?  
Can it stay and be with be with me?  
When will it last enough to have it here at home?  
Too many roads are needlessly divided  
By silent walls we build along the way  
Why be alone to learn that your life has more?  
That's what our love is for  
Tear down those angry walls. I'll walk with you where you go  
Still, you're the only one who'll ever know  
Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?  
Is the answer just another road to go?  
Does it have to leave to be?  
Or can it stay and be with me?  
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?  
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?  
When will it last enough to have it here at home?
