Before you say it's cheaper to keep her  
We consider and read her  
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her  
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita  
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater  
So put your Porche up, (uh)  
Get your divorce up, (uh)  
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up  
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here  
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill  
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya  
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners  
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient  
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners  
So keep it player dawg,  
Don't make me say it, naw  
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg  
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all  
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane  
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane  
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane  
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane  
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh,  
Uh-uh-uh (haa), uh-uh-uh (yea), uh-uh-uh  
  
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya  
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya  
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone  
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along  
Because I'm only 25, and still going live  
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside  
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive  
The Doubble are 760, or the 645, I'm  
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain  
Money ain't never been a thang  
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang)  
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this  
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless  
Baby girl you might just  
Get the shatter shine  
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes  
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine  
But you can't be a hater, mane  
You gotta keep it playa, mane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all  
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm  
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm  
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (wha')  
Not the ice, my beat is worth more  
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store  
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad  
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door  
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us  
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish  
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me  
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi  
I think and relay it  
I blink and P-J it  
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it  
And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me  
Got one in Virigina 'nother one in Miami  
  
[Chorus]
