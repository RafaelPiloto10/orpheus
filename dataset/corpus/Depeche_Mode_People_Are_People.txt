People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
So we're different colours  
And we're different creeds  
And different people have different needs  
It's obvious you hate me  
Though I've done nothing wrong  
I never even met you  
So what could I have done  
I can't understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand  
People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
Help me understand  
Now you're punching and you're kicking  
And you're shouting at me  
I'm relying on your common decency  
So far it hasn't surfaced  
But I'm sure it exists  
It just takes a while to travel  
From your head to your fist  
I can't understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand
