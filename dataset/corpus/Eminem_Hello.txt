Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)  
My name is Shaaady  
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)  
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)  
My name is Shaaady  
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)  
  
Yea  
  
You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?  
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth  
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house  
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?  
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse  
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out  
Nope, guess I'll re-route  
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch  
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth  
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it  
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet  
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet  
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes  
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers  
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels  
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules  
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello  
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Yea  
  
My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium  
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em  
It just becomes everyday extracurricular  
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun  
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one  
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room  
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?  
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?  
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?  
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one  
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm  
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run  
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone  
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some  
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum  
  
Umm  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Oh, Those were the days they certainly were  
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good  
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)  
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery  
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased  
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans  
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in  
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'  
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up  
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils  
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back  
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack  
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap  
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact  
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap  
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
So I'm sayin  
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)  
My name is Shaaady  
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)  
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)  
My name is Shaaady  
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)
