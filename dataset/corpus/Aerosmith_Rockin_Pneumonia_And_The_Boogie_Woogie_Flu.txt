I want to jump but I'm afraid I'll fall  
I want to holler but the jones' too small  
Young man really got the hold to it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all  
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream, I want you all to know  
I would be runnin' but my feets are too slow  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Baby callin' me now hurry home  
I know she's leavin' 'cause I'm takin' too long  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the rockin' pneumonia and Joe Perry too, oh  
  
Want some lovin', baby' that ain't all  
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream, I want to scream  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia, what's the matter with you?
