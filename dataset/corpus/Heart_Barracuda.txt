So this ain't the end, I saw you again, today  
I had to turn my heart away  
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
I bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down on my knees  
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh  
  
Back over time we were all trying for free  
You met the porpoise and me  
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick  
Oooo, Barracuda, oh yeah  
  
"Sell me, sell you" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick, no  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick  
Oooo, Barra-Barracuda
