If sweet death  
Should ever conquer me  
Let me know  
Boys, let me know  
If you hear him coming  
Won't you let me flee  
Let me go, boys, let me go  
  
One day  
Death is gonna conquer me  
I'll be down  
Where the waters flow  
I hope sweet Heaven  
Is a place for me  
Let me know  
Boys, let me know  
  
If sweet death  
Should ever conquer me  
Take me down  
To some place below  
If you hear him coming  
Won't you set me free  
Let me go  
Boys, let me go  
  
If you hear him comin'  
Won't you say for me  
That I just  
Don't want to go
