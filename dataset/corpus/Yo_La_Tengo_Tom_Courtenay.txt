Julie Christie, the rumors are true  
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued  
To the movie star and his sordid life  
Mr. X and his old-suffering wife  
  
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron  
In my room with the curtains drawn  
See her in the arms of Paul  
Say it, I can say no more  
  
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity  
Our hero finds his inner peace  
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm  
With a needle hanging out of its arm  
  
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen  
I know it's going away  
Gonna take its toll, gonna take its toll  
Gonna take my time  
  
And I'm thinking about the way things are  
And I'm thinking about the way things were  
Thinking about Eleanor Bron  
  
And I'm thinking about a lucky charm  
And I'm thinking about the needle  
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle  
And I'm thinking about...
