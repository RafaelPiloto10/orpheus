Roaming 'round your house  
Wasting your time  
No obligation, just  
Wasting your time  
So why are you alone?  
Wasting your time  
When you could be with me  
Wasting your time  
  
I'm a waste like you  
With nothing else to do  
May I waste your time, too?  
  
Warding off regrets  
Wasting your time  
Smoking cigarettes  
Wasting your time  
I'm just a parasite  
Wasting your time  
Applying myself to  
Wasting your time
