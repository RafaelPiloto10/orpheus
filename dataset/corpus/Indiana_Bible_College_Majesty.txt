[Verse:]  
With all the host of heaven  
We bow ourselves in reverence  
Holy, holy Savior  
With all the choir of angels  
We lift our feeble praises  
Glory, glory Jesus  
  
[Chorus:]  
Majesty  
Worthy Lamb  
Seated high  
We lift our hands  
We give our lives  
Holy One  
Eternal King  
We stand undone  
We can but sing  
Majesty  
  
[Verse 2:]  
God of all creation  
You gave Yourself to save us  
Holy, holy Savior  
Sovereign Lord, You reign  
Master of all the ages  
Glory, glory Jesus  
Majesty  
  
[Bridge:]  
Majesty  
Hallelujah  
  
[Outro:]  
Majesty, Majesty
