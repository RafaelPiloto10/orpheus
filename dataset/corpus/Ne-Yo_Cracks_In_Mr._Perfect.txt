So after this song  
You gon' love me for my honesty  
Or you gon' hate me for being me  
Yeah, I'm sayin'  
One of the two is gonna happen  
With all that I can be  
Is what I am and who I am  
  
Chasing women when I should be recording  
Invite a couple then I invite some more  
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning  
And I've only done one song  
20k on champagne in the club  
Then 20k more just because  
That's 40k in 3 hours  
But everybody watching my section  
So it's alright babe,  
I know it may sound silly to you  
Truthfully it's silly to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be faithful but I keep running in the dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
I ain't got a condom here  
(Oh no)  
Too lazy to run to the store  
(And it's cold outside)  
But you just met her 3 hours ago  
Says the angel on my shoulder  
See but the devil he could talk real loud  
And on my decision I'm not proud  
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Help being good and older  
So it's alright  
I know it may sound reckless to you  
Truthfully it's reckless to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be thankful but I keep running into dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh I do alot of stupid shit  
Hoping I never have to pay for rent  
It's like I become rather an idiot  
Every extra million I get  
I thank God for my family and my crew  
'Cause I can be alot to put up with  
Much love to my people that don't mind  
The cracks in Mr. Perfect  
  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
Said you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson  
Perfection is just glorified opinion  
When in the grand scheming things it's our imperfections  
That truly make us perfect  
So do yourself a favor  
Find the beauty in your cracks
