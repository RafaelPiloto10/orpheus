Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo in my mind  
I've played with fire  
Burned my fingers  
Now I'm gonna take my time  
You don't have to shout about it  
Can't you see it obvious  
Feel ? it's getting close to comfort  
Why you makin' such a fuss?  
  
Take your time with  
What you're doin'  
And you'll see the skies appear  
Seen and heard it all before her  
Now you understand my fear  
Can't you see the time will tell us  
How it's gonna always be  
You can wrap me  
Around your finger  
And I ain't no mystery  
  
Playing for time  
That's all I can do  
I'm playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
  
You can push me every which way  
Hey I got no place to fall  
Guess you're gonna rue your bullshit  
When your back's against the wall  
Louder now that's what the games go ?  
And I bought the devil now ?  
You can get to dream about it  
I won't need one anyhow  
  
Playing for time  
That's all I can do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
Playing for time  
That's all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
  
Oh, you don't have to shout about it  
Can't you see it obvious  
Feel it's getting close for comfort  
Why you making such a fuss?  
Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo my mind  
Played with fire, burned my fingers  
Now I'm gonna take my time  
  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
Playing for time  
That's all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall  
Playing for time  
All I want to do  
Playing for time
