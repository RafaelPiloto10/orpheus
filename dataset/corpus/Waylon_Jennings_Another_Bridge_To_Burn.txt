I've had to burn most every bridge I've crossed  
It seems like everything I've loved I'd lost  
When I met you I've thought my luck had turned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
So, I'll soon light the fire and move on  
Oh, I've already been here much too long  
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
Sometimes one must love enough for two  
And that's the way it's been with me and you  
I'll see your face no matter where I'll turn  
But that will be another bridge to burn.  
  
So, I'll soon light the fire and move on  
Oh, I've already been here much too long  
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
Our love's just another bridge to burn
