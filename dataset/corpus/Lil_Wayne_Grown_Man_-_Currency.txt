(Lil Wayne)  
Chea, what's up baby  
I aint tryin to do nothin but get my grown man on  
I aint tryin to hurt you, only if you want me to, ha  
Yea, somethin like that  
  
Yea wats happenin baby I'm lil wayne from new orleans  
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team  
Hop in this machine  
Banish from the scene  
God damnit I'm so manish  
Handle it like a standard  
So put ur panties and ur pants by the trashcan  
Romance on the floor plans  
Yea, we hold hands while we rollin  
Jus tryin to keep up with the program  
Jus tryin to sneak up on ya,  
Like how you doin mam  
I'm a old soul in a young man,  
We got to it and we didn't stop till the birds hit the block  
And she aint neva had it like that  
  
Chorus:  
Girl, you are so fine  
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight  
So I can get my grown man on with you,  
You don't kno about it, I'm on my grown man (4x)  
  
Currency  
Now I don't really hit the club  
But tonight I'll make an exception  
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction  
I'm lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge  
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn,  
I gotta keep my composure  
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier  
Young man, young money with the money long  
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown  
And ur perception of me is so wrong  
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds  
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt  
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved,  
And you don't rock like them I can see it in your eyes  
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise  
'cause tonight you lookin like ms right  
And I swore to be a player for life but I'll change for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil wayne  
You aint a woman, you a baby girl livin in a lady's world  
And I'm a grown man, the women understand  
See what I go thru, is what I owe you  
So you should throw that ass back to me right now  
Yeah, fly boy baby sit back relaxin,  
Cruise wit a nigga, destination satisfaction  
Now who's is it baby she say weezy fuckin baby  
I said yes it fuckin did  
She said don't you ever leave  
I say, I say but I got money on my mind  
Then I tell her nevermind and we do it one more time  
Yeah, for a large amount of time  
Long, it wont stop till daytime come home  
  
Chorus  
  
Damn, look, that, oh that right there  
That's the sunset girl, get ur visor  
Wheres those chanel shades I get you  
You always losin things  
And I'm always buyin new things  
I come a long way you remember  
Remember that block  
Look at you, you think you all grown  
  
You aint a woman, you a baby girl livin in a lady's world  
And I'm a grown man, the women understand  
See what I go thru, is what I owe you  
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
