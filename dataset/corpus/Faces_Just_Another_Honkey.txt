(ronnie lane)  
I close my eyes and ignore all the signs  
I'm walking 'round in circles  
I've closed my ears and believed my own lies  
And break the silence always  
I make a lot of words, big storm in the air  
All 'round your hair it's blowing  
Just leave it be and it will all blow away  
The weather's always changing  
You can go if you want to  
I don't own you, go be wild  
  
Leave my hand, it's wide open  
So's the door evermore  
It hurts me more to think i'll keep you in chains  
Than if you were to leave me.  
I am what you are and I'm running too,  
All for the open prairie.  
So you can go if you want to  
I don't own you, go be wild  
Leave my hand it's wide open  
So's the door forevermore.
