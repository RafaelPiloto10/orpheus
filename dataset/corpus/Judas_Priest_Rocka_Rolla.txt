Man eatin momma, steam driven hammer  
Sorts the men out from the boys  
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'  
Is one of her pride and joys  
  
She a classy, flashy lassy  
Imitation sapphire shine  
Two faced liar, full of fire  
But I know the flame is mine  
  
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man  
You can take her if you want her  
If you think you can  
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man  
You can take her if you want her you can  
  
She's a grip and choke ya  
Heavy smoker  
Wrong side of the law  
  
Midnight shady  
Good time lady  
Heavy, ready show you what for  
  
Barroom fighter  
Ten pint a nighter  
Definite ninety-nine  
  
Diamond cluster  
Knuckle duster  
Feline on the borderline  
  
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man  
You can take her if you want her  
If you think you can  
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man  
You can take her if you want her you can
