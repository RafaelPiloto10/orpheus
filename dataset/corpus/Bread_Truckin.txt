Truckin' down the highway  
Get outta my way  
Always in a hurry  
Always in between  
That's where you can find me  
Truckin' down the highway  
Sittin' in the cab of  
A ten ton machine  
Gettin' pretty tired of stoppin'  
In old run down cafes  
Some day I'm gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Gonna make some inroads  
Drivin' home a payload  
Truckin' down the highway  
Like you never seen  
Gettin' pretty tired of lookin'  
In truck stop cabarets  
Some day I'm gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Then you're gonna find me  
Truckin' down the highway  
Sittin' in the back seat  
Of a long limousine
