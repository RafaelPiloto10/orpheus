Girl before the mirror  
Appraises her disguise  
Child become a mother  
Tries to fix her eyes  
No more of his excuses  
It has to be today  
She can keep her fantasy  
If she can get away  
  
Paint her name on a one-way street  
Painted cheeks with angry heat  
Wounded pride on painted eyes  
Paint the night with battle cries  
  
All puffed up with vanity  
We see what we want to see  
To the beautiful and the wise  
The mirror always lies  
  
Boy before the mirror  
Checks his camouflage  
Polishes his armor  
And the charger in the garage  
No more lame excuses  
It has to be tonight  
He can take the princess  
If he can take the fight  
  
Pound the drums with martial beat  
Pound the streets with marching feet  
Wounded pride, distorted eyes  
Paint the night with battle cries  
  
All puffed up with vanity  
We see what we want to see  
To the powerful and the wise  
The mirror always lies  
  
Boys and girls together  
Mistake conceit for pride  
Ambition for illusion  
Dreams for self-delusion  
Girls and boys together  
See what it is we lack  
Boys and girls together  
Let's paint the mirror black  
Paint it black
