I know I said I would roll with you  
Put my lifestyle on hold for you  
All them sweet things that I told you  
This conversation is overdue  
Freeze!  
  
Getting too wild to respect the vow  
I just ain't ready to settle down  
My name too big in the ghetto now  
Freeze!  
  
Feels like I'm ready when I'm holding you  
But it's so many honey's what I'm supposed to do?  
Keep sending them apology notes to you?  
Freeze!  
  
All I need is for you to freeze  
This is hard on me  
I don't wanna leave  
But in the mean time take back the keys and  
Freeze!  
  
Don't change  
Don't go  
Don't leave  
Just freeze!  
I know girl it's a lot to ask!  
Tell me what other choice I have  
When you love someone reach back  
Just freeze!  
Don't change  
Don't go  
Don't leave  
Just freeze!  
Girl I hope you understand  
Promise I'll be back for you  
When I become a better man  
  
Why I gotta do this?  
I ain't sure  
Why I gotta wild out?  
Iono  
I know how it feels  
I been hurt before  
I know you disappointed you expected more  
Freeze!

I be tryina fight but it calls me yo  
Please don't change the locks on tha door  
Freeze!  
  
Quit cryin' 'cause it ain't yo fault  
Blame it on the streets of New York  
Young L gotta walk this walk girl  
Freeze!  
  
I know it's rough but I need your support  
You said it all last time that we fought  
So don't talk baby hold that thought and  
Freeze!

Girl I hope you understand  
Promise I'll be back for you  
When I become a better man  
  
What would you think if I told you that I  
Knew that I was breaking your heart  
Want to explain but where should I start?  
What would you think if I told you that I  
Wake up every morning with a different girl  
Cause I don't wanna settle down before I see the world!  
What would you think if I told you that I  
Know exactly what you need indeed  
Hate to follow but I'm scared to lead  
Too scared love will get the best of me  
I know deep down by the zest of me  
Hopefully some day I can give you that ring  
But until then just do this one thing  
Freeze!  
  
Don't change  
Don't go  
Don't leave  
Just freeze!

It's not like I forgot about you

Matter of fact I promise you  
But for right now I just need you to  
Freeze!
