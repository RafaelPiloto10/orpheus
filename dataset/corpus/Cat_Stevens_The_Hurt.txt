You say you want to seek the truth, but it's hard to find  
No one to help you, your friends don't have the time  
So you ride around in your car, switch on the radio  
You want to relate to something you once read in a book  
What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey  
Until I got hurt, 'til I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry  
But the tears you shed are only in your eye  
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell  
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion  
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't [  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
Young son, don't let me down, young son  
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now  
Hold on, never let go, now hold on  
Turn your heart to the bright sun  
Love will come your way  
Cause 'till you make that final show  
You'll never know what love you've been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on  
You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along  
( But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now ! You might be gone  
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
Until I got hurt, oh I didn't know what love is
