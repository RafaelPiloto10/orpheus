You gave it all for me  
My soul desire my everything  
All I am is devoted to You  
How could I fail to see  
You are the love that rescued me  
All I am is devoted to You  
And oh, how could I not be moved  
Lord here with You  
So have Your way in me  
'Cause Lord there is just one thing  
And that I will seek  
This is my cry my one desire  
Just to be where You are Lord  
Now and forever it's more than a song  
My one desire is to be with You  
Is to be with You Jesus  
How could I fail to see  
You are the love that rescued me  
All I am is devoted to You  
And oh, how could I not be moved  
Lord here with You  
So have Your way in me  
'Cause Lord there is just one thing  
And that I will seek  
This is my cry my one desire  
Just to be where You are Lord

My one desire is to be with You
