Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Some of us are free  
Some are bound  
Some will swim  
Some will drown  
Some of us are saints  
Some are clowns  
Just like me they're falling down  
  
Well I lied to the nation  
While my reputation ran dry  
From my lungs to my liver  
I clung to the river bank's side  
Yeah well I'm back in the water  
Doing what I ought to  
Trying to lead an ordinary life  
  
Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Some of us are green  
Some are brown  
Some are lost  
Some are found  
Sight unseen baby  
Sound on sound  
Pray for me I'm falling down  
  
I was lost in the jungle  
Crossed over enemy lines  
Well I got me a red nose  
By sleeping under hedgerows at night  
Yeah well I tried levitation  
Flying in formation  
Heaven knows the weight of this crime  
  
Is this  
Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Falling down  
Falling down
