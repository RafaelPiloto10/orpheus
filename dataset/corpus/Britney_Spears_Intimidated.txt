Ooh, I see you over there  
Don't be shy  
Come here, um!  
  
You got that thing that I can't deny  
So move it over here, oh yeah!  
You're giving signs that I recognize  
Say what you want, oh yeah  
  
Baby, there's something about you  
Show me, that nothing can hold you down  
'Cause I, I must confess  
I'm feeling you right now  
  
[Chorus]  
So, baby, take your chance  
And show your confidence  
Oh, baby, tell me who you are  
You make my body scream  
You make me believe  
that you're what I'm waiting for  
(Don't you be intimidated)  
  
Just be a man  
Show me where you stand  
Positively, oh yeah  
I don't come off shy if you want me back  
And if my E-G-O's, no, don't give up to fast  
  
Baby, there's something about you  
Show me, that nothing can hold you down  
Cause I, I must confess  
I'm feeling you right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y  
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y  
  
It doesn't matter, boo  
As long as you're diggin' me  
So much we can be,  
Yes, it's true  
But first you gotta make the move  
For me to see what I want with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
