Did you feel the mountains tremble?  
Did you hear the oceans roar?  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the risen one  
  
Did you feel the people tremble?  
Did you hear the singers roar?  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the saving one  
  
And we can see that God, You're moving  
A mighty river through the nations  
And young and old will turn to Jesus  
Fling wide Your heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring Your hope  
Songs that bring Your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble  
When all the saints join in one song  
And all the streams flow as one river  
To wash away our brokeness  
  
And here we see that God, You're moving  
A time of Jubilee is coming  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide your Heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord
