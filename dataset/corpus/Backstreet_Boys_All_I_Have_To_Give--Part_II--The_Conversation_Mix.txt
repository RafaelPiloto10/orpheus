I don't know what he does to make you cry  
But I'll be there to make you smile  
I don't have a fancy car  
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart?  
I don't know, but if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
When you talk, does it seem like he's not  
Even listenin' to a word you say?  
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Prayin' for the day that you'll be mine  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside, oh  
All the money in the world could never add up to  
All the love I have inside, I love you, baby  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
All everything I have is for you  
You've got what I got, you you  
What I need, my love is all I have to give  
All that I have is for you  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
Give the world to you lady  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you
