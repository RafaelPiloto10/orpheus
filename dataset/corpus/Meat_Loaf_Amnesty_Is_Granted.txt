Love's an hourglass, it goes out wide then it comes in closer  
Time ticks away, it drifts away leaving empty shattered moments  
Who said that love could last forever?  
I'm growing tired of feeling like I do  
As we drift apart, little secrets come between us  
As we sail away, feelin' comfort in the distance  
  
You said that love would last forever  
Neither one of us will ever surrender  
There comes a time, there's a place  
A change of heart, about face  
This is about love, it's about forgiveness  
Tell me now, tell me like it is  
You don't have to give, amnesty is granted  
What's done is done for everyone  
Come on baby let's start again right now  
Amnesty is granted  
  
Yeah I think a lot, yeah I been thinkin' a lot  
I been thinkin' about you baby  
Lord knows I been thinkin' about you  
I've been thinkin' that love should last forever  
Neither one of us will ever surrender  
There comes a time, there's a place  
A change of heart, about face  
This is about love, it's about forgiveness  
Tell me now, tell me like it is  
No one had to give, amnesty is granted  
Well done is done for everyone  
Come on baby let's start again right now  
Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty is granted  
  
You said that love would last forever  
Neither one of us will ever surrender  
There comes a time, there's a place  
A change of heart, about face  
This is about forgiveness  
Tell me now, tell me like it is  
No one has to give, amnesty is granted  
What's done is done for everyone  
Come on baby let's start again right now  
Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty is granted
