Always and forever is forever young  
Your shadow on the pavement  
The dark side of the sun  
Gotta dream the dream all over  
And sleep here tight  
You don't want to sing the blues  
In black and white  
  
And it's hope that spring's eternal for everyone  
If it ain't broken break it or the damage done  
  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
  
Violet in the rainbow just melt away  
There's not enough minutes in the hour  
Or hours in the day  
The song played in a circle that never skips a beat  
The stranger in a country that I have yet to meet  
  
And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone  
Got a lifetime in a second oh the damage done  
  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Guess there's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
  
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in  
The blind leading the blind, Lord  
Getting underneath your skin  
I can feel you in the silence  
Saying let forever be  
Love, only love, will set you free  
  
I want to love somebody  
Want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Lay lay, lay your love on me  
  
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in  
The blind leading the blind, Lord  
Getting underneath your skin  
I can feel you in the silence  
Saying let forever be  
Love, only love, will set you free
