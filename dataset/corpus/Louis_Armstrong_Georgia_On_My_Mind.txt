Georgia  
Georgia  
The whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
I said now, Georgia  
Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear  
As moonlight through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
I said, Georgia  
Georgia  
No peace I find  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Now ya know it's, Georgia  
Georgia, no peace, no peace I find  
Just this old, sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Just this old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind
