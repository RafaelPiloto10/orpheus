You told me baby, once upon a time  
You said if I would be yours, you would sure be mine  
That's alright  
I know you don't love me no more baby, but that's alright  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight  
  
You told me baby, your love for me was strong  
When I woke up little girl, half of this big world was  
gone  
That's alright  
I guess I'll never be the same but that's alright  
  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight  
  
Please tell me baby, what's getting wrong with you?  
You don't treat me halfway right baby, look a like you  
used to do  
But that's alright  
I guess I'll never be the same but that's alright  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight
