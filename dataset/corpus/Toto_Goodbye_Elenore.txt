I want to give her something she'll remember  
And she say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
I want to squeeze her tight and not offend her, yeah  
She said, "No, no, no, no, no"  
(And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter)  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
[Chorus]  
Seems as though you've got your way before  
You left me standing helpless just when I need more  
You broke my heart for the last time, you broke my heart for the last time  
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore  
  
I tried to tell the boys all about her, yeah  
And they say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
They told me she was loose, no doubt about her  
Well I say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
(And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter)  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Chorus You broke my heart for the last time, broke my heart, it's the last
time  
You stole my heart and now you're gone forevermore
