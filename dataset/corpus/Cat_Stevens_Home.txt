Home on a kite we fly,  
Home on a breeze we blow  
Eying the folks below and  
Watching everybody run,  
Each one heading for a different place  
Watching everybody hide,  
Each behind a different face  
  
Home where the days are long  
Back where the people are free,  
Home where all sides agree and,  
Everybody has a friend, oh  
And no one ever has to grab  
Everybody shares the love,  
Giving everything they have.  
  
Forever forever your lamp will burn  
Forever home forever would that you'd learn  
That you came with nothing  
So with nothing you'll return  
  
Home  
You know you're not alone  
It's only 'cause you're not a home  
That you feel so out of place.  
Forever forever your lamp will burn  
Forever home forever would that you'd learn  
  
That you came with nothing  
So with nothing you'll return  
  
Home where all the mums can sing,  
Back where the children don't cry,  
Home where you never ask why and  
Everybody has enough, and ya don't have to put on clothes  
Nobody has to hide 'case everyone already knows.
