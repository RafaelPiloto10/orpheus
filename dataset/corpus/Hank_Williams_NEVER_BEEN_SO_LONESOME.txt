Never been so lonesome  
Writer hank williams  
Now the day you left and went away  
The mean ole blues walked in to stay  
I feel like a child without a home  
Come back, baby, I'm all alone  
I ain't never been so lonesome in my life before  
The day you packed and went away  
I never thought that I would stay  
I miss you honey, and I'm lonesome too  
Never thought a soul could be so blue  
Ain't been so lonesome in my life before  
I need a little lovin', my heart is sick and sore  
Why you left, I don't know why  
And if you stay away I know I'll die  
Ain't been so lonesome in my life before
