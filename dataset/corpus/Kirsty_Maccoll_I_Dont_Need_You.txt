I hear a lot of talk about the things you say are good for me to do  
I've tried cooperation but I don't get nothing coming back from you  
  
So don't you like my face?  
No you look just fine  
Don't I know my place?  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you  
  
What am I gonna do, you drive me crazy when you say those things you say  
Every time I see you you have to fight the urge to walk the other way  
  
Don't you like my face?  
No you look just fine  
Don't I know my place?  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you  
  
I don't need you to tell me what to wear  
You can say that I don't care, it's true  
I don't need you to tell me how to speak  
I won't become some kind of geek like you  
  
Just to hear you talk you'd think the world revolves 'round what you've got to
say  
Now you can give me trouble but I'm going to give it back to you some day  
  
You don't like my face  
No you look just fine  
I don't know my place  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you
