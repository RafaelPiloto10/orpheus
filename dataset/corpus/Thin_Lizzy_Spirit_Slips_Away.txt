When the spirit slips away  
There's nothing you can do, there's nothing you can say  
May the angels be watching over you  
When your spirit slips away  
  
When the darkness starts to fall  
You're on your own and your back's against the wall  
May the angels bring their flame to you  
When your spirit slips away  
  
And when the music that makes you blue  
Unfolds its secrets, the mysteries are told to you  
May the angels sing rejoice to you  
That fateful day when your spirit slips away
