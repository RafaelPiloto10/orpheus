I picture us together  
Framed in gold leaf  
On the mantle with the others  
One big happy family  
But that snapshot can't be found  
And I don't trust my memory  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it's alright it's alright  
For a dream  
  
I imagine we are gathered  
But this time not dressed in black  
There's laughing and smiling  
Not stabbing in the back  
But it's too good to be true  
And too bad I still recall the screams  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I keep half the picture  
Mostly in my mind  
Mama dressed in white  
Ripped when she held your hand  
Showing no signs of age  
Just slightly frayed along the seam  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's alright  
All that I can claim  
It's alright  
And it will have to do  
It's alright  
Better than the pain  
It's alright  
Better than the truth  
It's alright  
Alright for a dream  
It's alright  
Better than fate and the great scheme  
It's alright  
It's alright  
  
For Christmas and for New Year  
I wish and I resolve  
But I'm disappointed by myself Jesus and Santa Claus  
I want to believe  
She's been saved  
And he's be redeemed  
  
And it's alright it's alright  
For a dream
