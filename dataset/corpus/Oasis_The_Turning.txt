Eyes over the city  
Rise up from your soul  
They hang over the streets at night  
Brought on by the cold  
  
We live with the numbers  
Mining our dreams for the same old song  
Why hope for the turning  
If everything you know is wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby  
Before you change your mind  
Then come on, when the rapture takes me  
Be the fallen angel by my side  
  
You carry the lantern  
I'll carry you home  
You search for the disappeared  
I'll bury the cold  
  
Yours is a messiah  
Mine is a dream and it won't be long  
No hope for the journey  
If no-one ever sees the dawn  
  
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby  
Before you change your mind  
Then come on, when the rapture takes me  
Will you be by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby  
Before you change your mind  
Then come on, when the rapture takes me  
Will you be by my side  
  
Hey come on, shake your rag doll, baby  
Before you change your mind  
And come on, when the rapture takes me  
Be the fallen angel by my side  
  
(Shake your rag doll baby)  
(Shake it 'round)  
(Shake your rag doll baby)  
(Shake it 'round)
