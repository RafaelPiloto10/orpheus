You were a lady - like lady I was a boy running wild  
The way that you used everything that god gave you  
I gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven  
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you
took me back to heaven again  
  
And I remember the Indian summer how you held me, how you loved me (Loved me
loved me)  
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong  
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to
tell you the truth  
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die  
Just to hear you that sees me through, oh what I'd give to re-live all the
Indian Summers with you  
  
So many hearts have been broken (Dum dumb dumb dumb-by Do Wah)  
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking (but then)  
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing  
Just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an Indian Summer
at 110 in the shade  
  
And I remember (and I remember) The Indian Summer  
How you held me in the moonlight  
  
We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head  
and if I'd known I'd lose you the moment I found you I'd love you all over
again  
  
'cause I'm still empty (I'm still empty) Come fill me ( Come fill me)  
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame 'cause it's all I want to do  
  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you-oooooooooooooooooo
