There is nothing that is wrong  
Wanting you to stay here with me  
I know you've got somewhere to go  
But won't you make yourself at home  
And stay with me?  
And don't you ever leave  
Lay down Sally, and rest you in my arms  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down Sally, no need to leave so soon  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you  
The sun ain't nearly on the rise  
We still got the moon and stars above  
Don't you go and say goodbye  
You can lay your worries down  
And stay with me  
And don't you ever leave  
Lay down Sally, and rest you in my arms  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down Sally, and no need to leave so soon  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you  
I long to see the morning light  
Coloring your face so dreamily  
So don't you go and say goodbye  
You can lay your worries down  
And stay with me  
And don't you ever leave  
Lay down Sally, and rest you in my arms  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down Sally, there's no need to leave so soon  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you  
Lay down Sally, and rest you in my arms  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down Sally, there's no need to leave so soon  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
