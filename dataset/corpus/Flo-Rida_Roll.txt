Gon' gamble with it, show me I'm da man (man)  
Shake it on da flo', like dice pon' ya hon  
Lemme see dat ass roll, roll, roll, roll, roll

Roll the police, when the fed a jock panic  
Pull ova, Flo Rida can handle it  
Gon' place ya bets, or we better yet a lan it  
City to Vegas, God's to bust it babies

Rappas tables invaded, great, watch it belated  
Block paper, I make it so I been gamblin' lately  
Yeah, we could play Casino

Bumpin' of da game pit  
Boss, ghetto boss, gon' show me I'm da man  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Got money on the shoota am I talkin' 'bout the Ruger  
The man that roulette click click I'm no loser  
Gal you the shit, southern slang from manure  
The bootsy connoisseur when I'm drankin' on Kalhua  
Oh see this rose girl I won't try you with tulips  
I'm pumpin' rose' are my chickens hot as hooters  
I'm Mandalay Bay, the Bellagio abuser  
My paper don't amuse ya then you haven't seen my muler  
Hard rock hotel I need the pink flamingo  
Gamble it female like ya hips is playin' Seelo,  
Check out ya Chanel see, I stroke ya ego  
Enough with the gazebo, pure cut yer use a kilo, blow  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Seven eleven, then it go, call it no guessin'  
Ain't naked but all these shawty's they lookin' at you dey treading  
I reckon it' 'cause you high rollin' they beggin' you beggin'  
Snake eyes while you collecting, then smiles while you investing  
Thousand dollar chips for ya thousand dollar hips  
Got these thousand dollar gifts need more thousand dollar tips  
I'll be your supplier, spin it like a dryer  
Roll for me baby be my Nascar tire  
I know the odds of winnin'  
Like I do off them linen  
They gangsters proud of woman  
I call it Robbin Gibbons  
Flo rida extortion  
Taking pictures of the Porsche's  
Say look what you bottom bought ya  
Now do what your mama taught ya  
  
[Chorus: x2]
