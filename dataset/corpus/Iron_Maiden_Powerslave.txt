Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus  
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go  
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple  
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?  
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.  
And in my last hour,  
I'm a slave to the power of death.  
  
When I was living this lie-fear was my game  
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,  
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.  
  
[Chorus]
