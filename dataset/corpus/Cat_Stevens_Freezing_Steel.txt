I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
And though my body's back I know it can't be real  
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel  
Oh where's it going, picked me up at seven  
When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning  
Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know  
This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time  
  
Back on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
The tied my body up, I'm forced to eat my meal  
A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too  
Now what's a soul to do  
Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me  
Is this a Eucharistic dove  
'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear  
But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place  
  
Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel.  
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel  
I made the cabin door, the pilot turned around  
He said we're Venus bound  
Oh please take me home  
After all I'm only human and the Earth is where I belong  
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face  
'Cause as he touched my head I saw myself back in bed  
  
I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
And though my body's back I know it can't be real  
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel
