I don't understand about complementary colors  
And what they say  
Side by side they both get white  
Together they both get gray  
  
But he's been pretty much yellow  
And I've been cryin' blue  
But all I can see is  
Red, red, red, red, red now  
What am I to do  
  
I don't understand about  
Diamonds and why men buy them  
What's so impressive about a diamond  
Except the mining  
  
And it's dangerous work  
Trying to get to you too  
And I think if I didn't have to  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it  
Maybe I wouldn't listen so much to you  
  
I've been watching all the time  
And I still can't find the track  
And I want to know is it okay  
Is it just fine  
Was it my fault  
Is it my lack  
  
I don't understand about  
The weather outside  
The harbinger to the words  
That somebody lied  
  
There's solace a bit for submitting  
To the fitfully cryptically true  
What's happened has happened  
What's coming is already on its way  
With a role for me to play  
  
I don't understand  
I'll never understand  
But I'm trying to understand  
There's nothing else I can do
