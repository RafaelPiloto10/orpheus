I can't help but feel alive.......  
Yeah...  
You pick up the phone on the seventh ring  
Even if I don't say my name  
You know who it is by my voice  
The melody that falls naturally from my lips  
But I was most happy when I lost my words  
Even on days when I have problems  
When I see you, they all fly away  
On my rainy days, when I can't see you  
Just by hearing your voice, automatically the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
Just by you looking at me with those eyes  
The excitement won't stop  
I can't say no  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I close my eyes and soon I feel so good  
It's automatic  
Your ambiguous attitude still makes me uneasy  
So being this infatuated with you  
Is still necessary for a while  
Even on the days when your kindness was hard to bear  
You always told the truth  
On rainy days whe I can't cry alone  
If I touch my ring, look, the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
My whole body gets warm  
I can't hide my excitement  
I can't even take a breath  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic  
When I access it  
I try to touch the glittering words  
Inside the computer screen and I feel so warm  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
I don't think you're beloved, just necessary  
It's not because I'm sad  
I just need you  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I feel so good  
It's automatic...  
I just want you here with me  
Tell me why  
It's automatic  
Automatic......
