Well I rush out blazin'  
My pulse is racin'  
As the rain streams down my face  
There's no turning back now  
To fight with fate  
Outnumbered, out of place  
They said go west young man, that's best  
It's there you'll feel no pain  
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave  
But I want to live again  
Can't let go  
There's a madness in my soul tonight  
Can't let go  
Must ride like the storm  
Can't let go  
Will I run out of control tonight  
Can't let go  
Until every trace is gone  
It's a winding road from Cuesta way  
Down sunset to the beach  
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive  
It's too far outta reach  
But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast  
All directions seems the same  
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'  
You can't let go again  
What's in a name on the street tonight  
I'm only a face in the crowd  
All in the dark and afraid tonight  
Nowhere to run or to hide  
But I can't let go  
Sometimes the world outside'll take you in  
With just a smile  
And you so blinded with desire  
A hundred sleepless nights have left me  
Wasted and so cold  
But I can take it I'm hangin'on  
Can't let go  
There's a madness in my soul tonight  
Can't let go  
Must ride it like the storm  
Can't let go  
Will I run out of control tonight  
Can't let go  
Until every trace is gone
