Ooh, look at me, I'm a Cadillac  
I'm a brand new convertible child  
I've never been driven baby, U're the first  
Come on baby, drive me wild... Ooh  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a telephone  
Whatever you want, just dial  
Come on honey, please, it's so easy  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
  
Chorus:  
Come on baby, do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Come on baby, do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a radio  
Call me up, make a request  
I'll do anything, just name it  
When I'm bad, baby, I'm the best  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a baby doll  
Just pick me up and I'll smile  
I may be young but I'm a whole lotta fun  
Come on, baby, drive me wild  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh, do it, drive me wild  
Come on baby, drive me wild  
Ooh, do it, drive me wild  
Come on baby, drive me wild  
Drive me wild, drive me wild
