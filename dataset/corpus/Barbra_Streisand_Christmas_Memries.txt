Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Making footprint in the snow  
Mem'ries  
  
Christmas Mem'ries  
They're the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking  
In the kitchen  
  
Cards and ribbons  
Everywhere  
Frosty Christmas Mem'ries  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
  
And oh the joy of waking X-mas morning  
The fam'ly round the tree  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
As merry as can be  
  
I close my eyes and see  
Shiny faces  
Of all the children  
Who now have children of their own  
  
Funny  
But come December'  
I remember every X-mas I've known  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see  
Those shiny faces  
Of all the children who now have children  
  
Of their own  
It's funny  
But come December  
When I remember  
  
Every X-mas I've ever known  
Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Shiny faces of all the children  
  
Precious mem'ries  
Of every Christmas  
I've known...
