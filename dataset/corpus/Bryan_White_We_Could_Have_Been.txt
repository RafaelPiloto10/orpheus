Today at work  
I overheard a name  
I knew it wasn't yours  
But it touched me just the same  
It felt so good to have you in my mind  
I guess I'm the sentimental kind  
  
[Chorus:]  
oh, I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
You were so brave  
When I was sky  
I made you laugh  
When something made you cry  
And I don't think we ever said good-bye  
Now I'll always wonder why  
  
(repeat chorus)  
[Bridge:]  
A time or two  
I thought about calling  
But something always gets in the way  
Maybe I'm afraid you'd really answer  
What would I say to you?  
  
(repeat chorus)  
We could have been
