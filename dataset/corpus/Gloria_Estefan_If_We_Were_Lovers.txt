One day soon, it's gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
If we were lovers  
If we were more than just good friends  
I know how good it could be  
Just by the way you're looking at me  
As if we were lovers, if we were lovers  
I've waited so long for that day  
I think you feel the same way  
You try so hard not to give it away  
Afraid that I'll discover  
What in your heart you know, is meant to be  
Darlin' if you want it to be me  
To be the one to say, I want you  
Then I'm telling you now  
Gonna find a way somehow, to be your lover  
And spend the whole night making love  
Then find it's never enough  
Just think what we are giving up  
Every day that we're not lovers  
Few times in our lives can we feel this way  
It would be a shame just to throw it away  
Time is slipping by, we don't know what's ahead  
I don't want to look back and have any regrets  
One day soon, it's gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
How much I love you
