I see your homegirl tryna sway you  
How you figure I would play you,  
Would you look at that  
The same one that caught her n-gga with some freak  
All in her sheets left for a week  
What she do, double back  
Now I know we far from perfect  
But I feel like this is perfect, do you disagree with that  
If not than holla back  
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back  
  
[Chorus:]  
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone  
Telling how man dogging me  
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing bout me  
Cause she aint showing me no sympathy  
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go  
Home a long time ago  
My best friend say  
My best friend say  
I'll be there, I'll still be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
  
[J. Cole]  
Now, now, now, know we be arguing  
But aint you riding with me  
We breaking up we making up  
Like Dwayne Wayne, and Whitney  
You throw things, you broke things  
Use both hands and hit me  
And right when you call the law  
I'll tell my boy to come get me  
Then you, than you start listening  
To friends, and then it, gets tricky  
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky  
So you ignore the hickys, the pics of chicks and they vicky's  
That they sent me, is that real love  
You're the only one that I will love  
Damn, damn  
  
My Best friends say  
I could stay with her  
At her house, no doubt anytime I like  
My best friends say  
Don't let you in my life, cause you don't do for me  
And you don't act right  
My best friends say  
If she was me, she'll let you go along time ago  
My best friends say, my best friends say  
  
I'll still be there for you  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
  
Girl I can see it in your eyes  
How you feeling, let me know what's on your mind  
We've been together for a long long time  
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes  
I know to you it feel like I'm never around  
Round, round, round  
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down  
Hey, hey, hey, hey
