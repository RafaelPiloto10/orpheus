Hey!  
Look what you have done.  
Showing me the sun,  
And now it's shining through.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Hey!  
I like the things you say,  
And I like the way  
You do the things you do.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new,  
They just turn it blue.  
But this time  
Is my time,  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you.  
So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.  
It's nice to be with you.

So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.
