And now the news  
  
[Chorus:]  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go  
  
The communist world is fallin' apart  
The capitalists are just breakin' hearts  
Money is the reason to be  
It makes me just want to sing Louie Louie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A fine little girl is waitin' for me  
But I'm as bent as Dostoevsky  
I think about the meaning of my life again  
And I have to sing Louie Louie again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's give it to 'em right now  
Oh man, I dunno like, health insurance  
The homeless and world peace and aids and education  
I'm tryin' to do right  
  
But Hey  
Life after Bush and Gorbachev  
The wall is down but something is lost  
Turn on the news it looks like a movie  
It makes me want to sing Louie Louie  
  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go, let's go
