I was born a beggar  
With the garbage round my feet  
The devil lived in every hole  
And every corner of the street  
When mystery is all there is  
You got nothing to lose  
So come on and buy me  
Come and buy me some red red red shoes  
  
Don't tell me what I do is wrong  
Don't preach 'cause you don't know  
'Cause I was left without a chance  
Such a long time ago  
And anything is better  
Than being cut and bruised  
So come and buy me some red red red shoes  
  
Don't tell me what I do is wrong  
Don't preach 'cause you don't know  
'Cause I was left without a chance such a long time ago  
And anything is better  
Than being battered and bruised  
So come on and buy me some red some red red shoes
