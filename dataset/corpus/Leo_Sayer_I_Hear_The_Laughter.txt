Listening to the falling rain  
Always seems to bring her back again  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
Sound of her voice, her look upon her face  
Like children playing children's games  
We joked and laughed at every passing day  
I'm so much older, things have changed  
I've realized that now it's just too late  
  
I hear the laughter echoin' through my brain  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
I tried to forget her heaven knows  
Seems there's no direction left to go  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
  
I'm alone again, alone again  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could turn this all around  
It's just my foolish fantasy  
But that won't bring your sweet love back to me  
  
I hear the laughter, somebody called my name  
I hear the laughter and I can feel the pain  
I hear the laughter echoing through my brain  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
I hear the laughter, I hear the laughter
