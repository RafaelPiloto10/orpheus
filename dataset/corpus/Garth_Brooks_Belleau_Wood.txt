Oh the snowflakes fell in silence  
Over Belleau Wood that night  
For a Christmas truce had been declared  
By both sides of the fight  
As we lay there in our trenches  
The silence broke in two  
By a German soldier singing  
A song that we all knew  
Though I did not know the language  
The song was "Silent Night"  
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
"All is calm and all is bright"  
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me  
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong  
But I stood up on my trench  
And I began to sing along  
Then across the frozen battlefield  
Another's voice joined in  
Until one by one each man became  
A singer of the hymn  
Then I thought that I was dreaming  
For right there in my sight  
Stood the German soldier  
'Neath the falling flakes of white  
And he raised his hand and smiled at me  
As if he seemed to say  
Here's hoping we both live  
To see us find a better way  
Then the devil's clock struck midnight  
And the skies lit up again  
And the battlefield where heaven stood  
Was blown to hell again  
But for just one fleeting moment  
The answer seemed so clear  
Heaven's not beyond the clouds  
It's just beyond the fear  
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds  
It's for us to find it here
