There'll be times  
When my crimes  
Will seem almost unforgivable  
I give in to sin  
Because you have to make this life livable  
But when you think I've had enough  
From your sea of love  
I'll take more than another riverful  
And I'll make it all worthwhile  
I'll make your heart smile  
  
Strangelove  
Strange highs and strange lows  
Strangelove  
That's how my love goes  
Strangelove  
Will you give it to me  
Will you take the pain  
I will give to you  
Again and again  
And will you return it  
  
There'll be days  
When I stray  
I may appear to be  
Constantly out of reach  
I give in to sin  
Because I like to practice what I preach  
I'm not trying to say  
I'll have it all my way  
I'm always willing to learn  
When you've got something to teach  
And I'll make it all worthwhile  
I'll make your heart smile  
  
Pain will you return it  
I'll say it again, pain  
Pain will you return it  
I won't say it again  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
Will you give it to be  
I give in  
I'll say it again  
I give in  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
That's how my love goes  
I give in  
I'll say it again  
I give in
