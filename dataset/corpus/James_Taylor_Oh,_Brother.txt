I'm not much for making little wishes,  
But I'd like a little wish  
To come true for you.  
I'm not talking about loaves and fishes  
But I wish that there was something  
I could do for you.  
Here's a little bit of cheap advice  
To be taken in an hour of need,  
Don't assume that the life you left  
Is the life you have to lead.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
I'd like to know who's knocking on door,  
I'd like to know what they come here for.  
You'd like to say no but the words won't come,  
Come in and sit down,  
Seem to roll off your tongue.  
You forget to remember,  
To never die young,  
One kiss leads to another.  
Brother when you come back home,  
Standing in line, all of your friends,  
Standing in line, party never ends,  
Standing in line, the river flows,  
The river bends,  
Standing in line, all of your friends.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
And that moon will be shining in  
The trees all night long,  
Something bound to happen for sure.  
Soon you'll be stopping by  
Talking to a friend again,  
Swear you ain't never tasted nothing so pure.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
When you come home,  
Your friends are dropping by,  
When you come home,  
The moon is gonna shine.  
When you come home,  
I tell you no lie,  
When you come home,  
They're gonna offer you a line.  
Standing in line, all of your friends,  
Standing in line, party never ends now.  
Standing in line, the river flows,  
The river bends,  
Standing in line, all your so called friends.  
Standing in line, when you come home,  
Standing in line, oh brother, oh brother now.  
Standing in line, when you come home,  
Standing in line, what you're gonna do now?
