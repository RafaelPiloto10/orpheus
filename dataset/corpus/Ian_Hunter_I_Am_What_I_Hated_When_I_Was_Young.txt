Well I don't follow any trend  
I don't sulk for hours on end  
I don't wanna reach out 'n' punch someone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I don't wear designer clothes  
I ain't got pins in my nose  
I ain't got a tattoo on my bum  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
Poverty was a wonderful thing everyone enjoyed  
We were eatin' grass not smokin' it  
Wasn't like this when I was a boy  
Wasn't like this when I was a boy  
  
I don't rob old people's homes  
I don't steal no cellular phones  
I kinda like my Dad and Mom  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I don't holler, I don't hoot  
I don't act like a nincompoop  
I don't hide when the police come  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
I'm slowin' down, I'm getting old  
N' my back is getting bad  
I just sit 'n' moan all day  
Wasn't like this when I was a lad  
Wasn't like this when I was a lad  
  
Comb my hair, brush my teeth  
Wash my feet more than once a week  
N' I never leave my flies undone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I'm the original mixed up kid  
I ain't proud of what I did  
Now I'm older, calmed down some  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young
