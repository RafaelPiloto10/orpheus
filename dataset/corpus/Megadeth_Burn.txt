I've got a sickening feeling  
My life is standing still  
It's clear that fate is closing in  
But this is the life I choose  
I've got so much time to kill  
Born to lose, I'll die to win  
  
Burn, baby burn 'cause it feels so good  
  
I'm getting on my own nerves  
And I get no satisfaction  
Till I light it up and burn it down  
One match lights my fire  
And it starts a chain reaction  
That burns my crooked past to the ground  
  
Burn, baby burn 'cause it feels so good  
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would  
Fire, I've got the fire  
Fire, burning desire my desire to burn  
  
I hear the darkness call  
The sirens are growing near  
It's time I make my great escape  
The flames are getting tall  
Inside my rear view mirror  
Just a spark is all it takes
