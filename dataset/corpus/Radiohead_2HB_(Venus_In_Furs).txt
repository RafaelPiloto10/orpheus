Oh, I was moved by your screen dream  
Celluloid pictures living  
Your death could not kill my love for you  
Take two people romantic  
Smoky nightclub situation  
Your cigarette traces a ladder  
Here's looking at you kid  
Celebrate years  
Here's looking at you kid  
Wipe away tears  
Long time since we're together  
Now I hope it's forever  
Ideal love flies away now  
White jacket black tie wings too  
You gave her away to the hero  
Words don't express my meaning  
Notes could not spell out the score  
But finding not keeping's the lesson  
Here's looking at you kid  
Hard to forget  
Here's looking at you kid  
At least not yet  
Your memory stays  
It lingers ever  
Will fade away never
