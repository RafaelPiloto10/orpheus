Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (why you lie to me)  
Whoa whoa whoa (you was everything I needed)  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (I can't go on) (I gotta know when it is
true)  
Sweet lies, girl (listen)  
(Verse one)  
My stomach aches and sweat in my palms  
This is so sudden (what I'm supposed to do?)  
I thought that love calls between our hearts  
We're truly touching (be careful what you ask for)  
(B-Section)  
One day I'll meet that special girl  
Just for me  
She'll have open ears  
She won't ignore me  
I'll bet I'll meet some special girl  
She'll save the day  
And she'll get it (ohhhhhhh)  
When I say girl  
(Hook)  
I don't want to go on  
In this life  
Wondering why  
Why  
I'd rather the bitter truth  
When it comes to you  
Than those sweet lies  
Lies (sweet lies)  
(Verse Two)  
Why oh why this song  
Don't you love me (I love you, put that on everything)  
Well maybe where I went wrong  
Was callin you honey (shorty, shawty, don't matter)  
(B-Section)  
One day I'll meet that special girl

Lies (sweet lies)  
(Bridge)  
Ohhhhhhh (what I'm supposed to do)  
Ohhhhhhh (sit around herea ll day thinking about this)  
(man please)  
Ohhhhhhh (I'm lacing up my bathing apes)  
Then I'm out  
I'm out to night  
You'll see  
(Verse 3)  
I bet it was sweet on your lips  
When you told me (let me show you)  
Ayay (it hurt me)  
My heart is just twisting slowly  
(I let you do) no one to hold me
