I've been mixed up cut up so sit down and shut up  
'cause I'm a hard man  
I was hung up strung out but I can't take no more junk  
Even if you can  
  
It will beat ya cheat ya  
Deceit ya defeat ya  
  
No rocker bopper show stealin' teeny bopper  
Gonna get a thing from me  
No fat black back scratchin' pussy cat  
Gonna get her claws on me  
  
Well they got a scheme to sell you kids  
The silver screens and glossy magazines  
  
Better hold back good times strung out hung up  
Strong out picked on ripped off kicked out  
Spit onset up ripped off locked up sent down  
Maybe you're as hard as I am  
  
Just blow me away
