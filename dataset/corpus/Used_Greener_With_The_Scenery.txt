You took it back  
How could you go and do something like that  
My fingernail phase  
Worst has got the best of you  
I ask you and I know I need to change  
You took it back  
You ripped my heart out of my then you put it back  
I'm pulling my hair  
I let you just a million times  
I love you even though it isn't fair  
  
Change  
Run we go around again in circles  
Play this game over again
