Her name was Lady Godiva  
A lady so brave and so strong  
Her husband the Earl of Mercia  
He treated her terribly wrong  
  
She's a lady  
She's a lady  
She rode naked on horseback  
To stop him from his tax increase  
  
But people in town closed their curtains  
Than prison for living in peace  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a lady  
She's a lady  
She's a lady, Lady Godiva  
The hero of Coventry  
L-L-Lady Lady Godiva  
She rode into history  
  
Then sneaking a glance through the window  
Was a guy they called Peeping Tom  
He caught a glimpse and was blinded  
Curiosity sometimes is wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People liked Lady Godiva  
Respectfully looking away  
They honored incredible courage  
Her legend lives until today  
  
[Chorus: x 2]
