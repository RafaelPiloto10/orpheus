This is how it seems to me  
Life is only therapy  
Real expensive  
And no guarantee  
So I lie here on the couch  
With my heart hanging out  
Frozen solid with fear  
Like a rock in the ground  
Woman you move me  
You give me courage I didn't  
know I had  
You move me on  
I can't go with you  
And stay where I am  
So you move me on  
This is how love was to me  
I could look and not see  
Going through the emotions  
Not knowin' what they mean  
And it scared me so much  
That I just wouldn't budge  
I might have stayed there forever  
If not for your touch  
Oh but you move me  
Out of myself and into the fire  
You move me  
Now I'm burning with love  
And with hope and desire  
How you move me  
You go whistling in the dark  
Making light of it  
Making light of it  
And I follow with my heart  
Laughing all the way  
Oh 'cause you move me  
You get me dancing and you  
make me sing  
You move me  
Now I'm taking delight  
In every little thing  
How you move me
