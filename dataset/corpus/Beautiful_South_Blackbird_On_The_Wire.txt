Eyes to take you dancing  
Mouth to leave your wife  
Legs to run away with  
And you wonder why?  
  
Heart that makes you bypass  
Every other girl  
Smile that keeps you grinning  
At the madness of this world  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
Front to make you happy  
Back to make you weep  
Lips to keep you kissing  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
  
Tears to break a backbone  
Laughs to win a war  
And people come and ask me  
What I love you for  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
And with a tongue built from quicksilver  
And a character of steel  
They actually come and ask me  
How I feel  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below
