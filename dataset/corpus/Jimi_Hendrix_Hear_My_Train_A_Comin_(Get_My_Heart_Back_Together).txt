Jimi:  
"thank you very much. And I'd like to go on with another slow thing.  
I'd like to get by with A little bit of jam messin' around with back  
At the house. I think we're going to call "get my heart back together  
Again"  
  
Have you heard about my baby  
Have you heard about my baby  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Have you heard about my baby makin' love to all the world  
  
Well I, wait around train station waitin' for that train  
Take me  
Take me away from this loansome town  
Too bad you don't love me no more girl  
Too bad your people put me down  
Put me down  
Tears burnnin' me  
Tears burning me in my eyes  
Way down  
Way down in my soul  
Tears burnin' me in my soul  
Too bad you put me away like A child now  
Lord it's too bad they made me go  
  
I hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
Hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna leave this town  
Lord, I got to leaze this town  
I wanna be A voodoo child  
And try and be A magic boy  
Come back and buy this town  
Come back and buy this town  
And put it all in my shoe  
Heyaaaa  
  
If you'll make love to my one more time baby  
Hey, I might even give A piece to you  
Peace to you  
I hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
I hear my train A comin'  
  
Hear my train A comin'  
Hear my train A comin'  
Hear my train A comin'  
  
Jimi:  
"thank you very much, yeah. Are these microphones all screwed up  
Again as usual, yeah. I know what you mean. It's so embarasing man  
I'm sitting up here. " DAMN OOH "those people are lookin' at me too man"  
Damn "half A million eyes, tell somebody to turn off the microphones  
While we get in tune alright. "
