All the girls I grew up with  
Got a husband house and kids  
That's what everybody did after school  
If I'd a had a steady boyfriend  
I mighta stuck around like them but  
Back then I never had a reason to  
L.A.'s like another planet  
Had to live there to understand it  
And I thought when I first landed that California's cool  
Till I saw good girls gettin' outta control  
Endin' up sellin' their souls  
Oh no I never had a reason to  
I never had a reason to stay  
To not walk away  
Nobody's heart was gonna break over me  
I never had somethin' worth keepin'  
Or somebody I needed  
Like I'm needin' you  
Baby don't you see it's true  
I never had a reason to believe in love  
To some love comes as a vision  
To some it's a sweet baptism  
Me and love had a head-on collision  
When I ran into you  
Got some feelings I'm figurin' out  
No I don't know exactly how  
Until now I never had a reason to
