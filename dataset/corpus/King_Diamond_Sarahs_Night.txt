Monday night, Tuesday morning, master bedroom  
  
Salem's standing in the dark  
Watching Sarah's sleeping body  
Someone is in her bed  
Twisting, turning in his fever  
Savid will not even see her  
I an invisible I am the one to bring you down  
  
I open up my hand, the "Goofer Dust" is falling  
It's now on Sarah's hand  
You can almost see the dead, as they enter Sarah's head  
Then deep into her stomach, I wonder how the baby feels  
  
Violently she's sitting up  
Screams of pain I know she's hurting  
I only see white in her eyes  
  
Sarah speaks in unknown tongue  
Then she spits a little blood  
Time has come, I must be gone  
In comes Grandpa, what is he doing  
I thought I had him not moving  
But the dead in Sarah's head, will take her to an early grave  
Salem is gone  
  
"Go back to sleep me dear  
It's just another nightmare  
Those God damn voodoo drums  
I will stay in here tonight, and keep an open eye  
So you can sleep again  
Sarah sleep, Sarah sleep, Sarah sleep
