Well I don't really know my self  
Cause I ain't I really tried  
Rutting leaning on that crazy stuff  
Too many friends have died  
  
Got respect for the sleepers  
But the sleepers...  
  
I'll be buried in the same old way  
But probably not for years  
Yeah, I'll be buried in the same old way  
From tv whiskey and beer  
  
Got respect for the sleepers  
But the sleepers are dead  
  
Well I don't really know my self  
Cause I ain't I really tried  
But falling that crazy stuff  
Too many friends have died  
  
Got respect for the sleepers  
All the sleepers are dead  
Yeah, they're dead
