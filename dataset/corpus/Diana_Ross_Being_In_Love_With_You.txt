I thought I'd already touched the sky  
I got to know you and I don't know why  
But all of my life couldn't mean as much  
As just being touched by you  
  
I never thought of me growing up  
Got my directions but the road was rough  
It's only the dream of a teenage queen  
But somehow I made it through  
  
And I'd love to see  
Those faces of those friends I left behind  
And even those who spoke for me  
Just trying to be kind  
And no one said I love you just the way  
I know you do  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be  
Being in love forever  
And ever, ever  
  
I stare and wonder at what I found  
I just discovered why the world is round  
Round in a circle my arms will be  
And doing the same as you  
It ain't right it's only for you and me  
Only the lonely do it separately  
Keep it alive on the food of love  
But only the chosen few  
  
In my life you see some changes in me  
We listen and we grow  
Any child that clings to childish things  
Is trying to let go  
And up to now  
I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be  
Being in love forever  
And ever, ever  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be
