[Chorus:]  
Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow, moon shadow, moonshadow---  
Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---  
  
And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my land,  
Oh if I ever lose my hands, Oh if I won't have to work no more.  
  
And if I ever lose my eyes, if my colours all run dry,  
Yes if I ever lose my eyes, Oh if I won't have to cry no more.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if I ever lose my legs, I won't moan, and I won't beg,  
Yes if I ever lose my legs, Oh if I won't have to walk no more.  
  
And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south,  
Yes if I ever lose my mouth, Oh if I won't have to talk...  
  
Did it take long to find me? I asked the faithful light.  
Did it take long to find me? And are you gonna stay the night?  
  
[Chorus]  
Moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow.
