There you go.  
You're like fireworks and it's the fourth of July.  
I can't turn away, look what you've done to me.  
One more dance and I'm taking over,  
I need your touch.  
One more dance when you're lickin' your lips,  
I'm gonna have to rush this night,  
We should get outta here,  
Might have to party for two,  
Then you say you love me  
That talk is dangerous  
I want you like I know you want me  
Am I saying too much?  
Right now, say what you want to  
You can't make me blush.  
  
Step through the door  
Like you know you're fine  
Step on my floor  
Like you know you're fine  
You're on fire  
But you play it cool  
Every eye on you  
  
So don't blame me  
For wanting you just too much  
You're sexy  
And what you need's a sexy love  
All I see  
Every time I look at you  
Is you are free  
I just wanna be with you  
Give me that sexy love  
  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
  
We got places to go  
There's so much I wanna see  
Let's make out on the low  
And just focus on us  
I want you to feel like you're having the time of your life  
And I can't wait to start like you're waiting, accept my invite  
  
Step through the door  
Like you know you're fine  
Step on my floor  
Like you know you're fine  
You're on fire  
But you play it cool  
Every eye on you  
  
So don't blame me  
For wanting you just too much  
You're sexy  
And what you need's a sexy love  
All I see  
Every time I look at you  
Is you are free  
I just wanna be with you  
Give me that sexy love  
  
Oh-oh-oh  
Don't play me I can't get enough  
I just want your sexy love  
Oh-oh-oh  
Your body's all I'm thinking of  
I just want your sexy love  
  
So don't blame me  
For wanting you just too much  
You're sexy  
And what you need's a sexy love  
All I see  
Every time I look at you  
Is you are free  
I just wanna be with you  
Give me that sexy love  
  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
  
Give me that sexy love  
Woah-oh-oh-oh (so sexy so sexy)  
  
Give me that sexy love  
Woah-oh-oh-oh (so sexy so sexy)  
Give me that sexy love
