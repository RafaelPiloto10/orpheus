Don't you hate a coulda' woulda' shoulda'? (oh oh no, oh oh no)  
Coulda' did what it did why ya shoulda' shoulda'? (oh oh no, oh oh no)  
  
If I had a dollar for every should be, know how reach I would be  
Like they say it is what it is, not what it could be,  
Can't cry feel guilt over spilled milk,  
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to Versace silk,  
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds  
I got good watches just bad timing (Oh oh no)  
The chick I met at the club was cute,  
Still feel like I'm getting brain from the substitute,  
'Cause this ain't you and that ain't me,  
Claim you happy then why you're so mad at me?  
Can't hold on to what you had just what you got,  
You should be here, but you're not.  
  
I'm doing it again  
What I told myself I would not do, oh  
It's 4:15 AM I'm sittin' here drinkin', reminiscing on you, oh  
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't  
You get blowed then we both get low  
As I lay here with some girl I don't' know  
In the back of my mind one million times  
I tell myself  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
As I watch her sleep, all that I can think  
She's beautiful (Beautiful but she's not you) but she's not you  
Love her just a night, then out of my life (Out of my life)  
Damn why can't I do this right?  
When you told me you wanted to leave (Wanted to leave)  
I pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)  
But as I lay here I can hardly breathe,  
Laying next to she, when in reality, it should be  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
Uh uh should be you, should be you baby ah  
  
Hey check this out  
My life, lights camera fame and action,  
Feeling dreams from all these private planes I'm catchin'  
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin' for a night  
Back up for us, exchangin' pain and passion, (Let's go)  
Romances, kinda like the Phantom doors you used to ride  
'Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide  
God teaches lessons every day,  
You was all I needed like Meth' and Mary J  
The sun don't shine forever  
Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together  
Guess we avoided what we could've went through  
That don't change the fact (Girl it should be you) that it should've been you  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now (Should be you and me, girl)  
Said it should be you (should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now ah  
  
Oh said it should be you  
It should be you, you, whoa  
I said it should be you, it should be you, uh oh oh oh
