[Gunshots]  
  
Four shots to the chest, my niggas get at me  
They don' fucked around and fucked up my new white tee  
I'm just livin' my life, why they mad at me  
Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming  
Should I even bust back, you ain't see me running  
I hope heaven got a VIP line  
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door  
You know I hate waitin' in line  
  
Paramedics on the way, but they wastin' they time  
Everybody standin' over a nigga, screamin'and shit  
Damn, ya'll give a nigga a second to think  
Which one of you niggas shot me, it was one of you bastards  
Let my nigga Kink throw a hundred grand in my casket  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans  
A USDA top and a throw-away glock  
Bury me a G, nothin more nothin less  
When I get where I'm goin, I just gotta be fresh  
  
Expect the worst, but hope for the best  
But you know how it is, amen god bless  
I can't leave now niggas owe me money  
My nigga on the westside owe me bout a dub  
And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too  
  
I should'a hugged my son, should'a kissed my mother  
Spent some time with her, show her I love her  
Every night she was prayin for me, I was in the streets  
Active little nigga, should I stay in some beef  
Gucci go through some shit and he really need me  
And what about the streets, shit they need me too  
I'm on some got Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

[Young Jeezy]  
I was on my way I was almost gone  
I was almost there I was almost home  
It was some Kanye shit tryna touch the sky  
Jesus walks god testify  
I'm a legend like John we're ordinary people  
You only get one life there's no sequel  
So you can't take nothing for granted  
And don't take granted for nothing  
  
So I gotta thank god for waking me up this morning  
And giving me this air to breath  
Jesus lord forgive me for  
Every Gram I sold  
Every glock I popped  
Every rock that i...  
  
[Chorus: x 4]
