Pack up your troubles and just get happy  
Ya better chase all your cares away  
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy  
Get ready for the judgment day  
  
The sun is shinin', c'mon get happy  
The Lord is waiting to take your hand  
Shout Hallelujah, c'mon get happy  
We're goin' to the Promised Land  
  
We're headin' 'cross the river  
Gonna wash our sins in the tide  
It's all so peaceful  
On the other side  
  
Forget your troubles and just get happy  
Ya better chase all your cares away

Get ready for the judgment day
