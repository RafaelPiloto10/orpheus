These days I'm looking like a pitiful sight  
Got a suicide smile on my face every night  
I walk alone  
Talk to myself  
Shout angry words up to the sky  
People stop and stare  
Like I'm out of my head  
But what do they know  
About the tears that I cry  
And I cry yes I cry and that's why  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
I stop into a church and I waste another prayer  
Well if there's someone listen' to me  
No one's talkin' up there  
So I walk down a street  
Where lonely men sleep  
With what money can buy  
I tell myself that life ain't over just yet  
I can learn to forget if only I try  
And I try and I try but it's a lie  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
Nobody  
Nobody  
Nobody understands  
And inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man
