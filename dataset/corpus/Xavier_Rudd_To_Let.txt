The sun is peaking  
The sun is peering across the bay  
I am walking  
Sucking stale air on this fine day  
Lady squeaking  
Lady she shuffles ten feet in front  
Her pants are squeaking  
Her pants are squeaking as she does  
I'll sit him down  
I'll sit him down  
The sun is peaking  
The sun is peering across the bay  
I am walking  
Sucking stale air on this fine day  
I'll sit him down  
I'll sit him down  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Here don't fly away now  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Here don't fly away now
