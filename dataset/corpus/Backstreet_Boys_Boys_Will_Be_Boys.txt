[Chorus]  
Oh boys will be boys  
Oh boys will be boys  
  
You've got something so that incredible in my eyes,  
My heart (my heart) is stars to bumpin' whenever you around  
My whole world upside down baby  
But I try to get closer and you always push me away  
You tell me its much too soon, but I just can't help it  
I've always got to make a play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All my senses, going around you all the time  
And I invences, I've never going hope  
Always gotta lose control  
I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait  
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go  
  
I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait  
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
My body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
  
[Chorus]
