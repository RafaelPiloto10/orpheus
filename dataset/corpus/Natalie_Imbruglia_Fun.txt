So long, I've been waiting to sing this song  
Now I should, if is worth it anymore  
When kin at me most  
People always ask it, about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you, with you, we're so one  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
  
Try  
Never stop to wonder why  
Oh how  
I just hope you're happy now  
Hope you're happy now  
  
People always ask it, about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you, with you, we're so one  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didn't we have fun?  
Though it hurt like air, yeah  
I don't want to forget  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didn't we have fun?  
Though it hurt like air, yeah  
I don't want to forget  
I don't want to forget
