I don't know, how I've survived  
In this cold and empty world for all this time  
I only know, that I'm alive  
Because you loved me  
  
When I recall, what I've been through  
There's some things that I wish I didn't do  
Now I do, the things I do  
Because you love me  
  
[Chorus:]  
And now that you're in my life  
I'm so glad I'm alive  
Cause you showed me the way  
And now I know now how good it can be  
Because you loved me  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I believe in things unseen  
I believe in the message of a dream  
And I believe in what you are  
Because you love me  
  
With all my heart  
And all my soul  
I'm loving you and I never will let go  
And every day  
I'll let it show  
Because you love me  
  
Because you love me  
Because you love me
