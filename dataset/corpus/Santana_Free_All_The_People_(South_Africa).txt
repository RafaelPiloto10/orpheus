You got to free all the people in South Africa  
You got to make life worth living in Soweto  
You got to free all the people in South Africa  
You got to make life worthwhile  
Give reason to smile  
  
Freedom is a birthright  
Given by Jah to Man  
You can not claim it, this you must understand  
Who are you to decide, who has to give it up  
Know it in your heart, that it's wrong  
They've had enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Slavery is brutal, it steals your identity  
Wherever it's living, suffer humanity  
What leads you to believe, you can treat people so  
You know it isn't right, give up the fight  
Let them go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's not right, this hate for Life you're teaching  
No more fight, we're all in this together  
You've lost sight, you'll never find what your  
Soul is seeking  
You, you abolish, apartheid  
  
[Chorus]
