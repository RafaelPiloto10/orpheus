Cool woman, cool eyes, you got me hypnotized  
So head down, get a rhythm  
Stop your stalling and your bitching  
I'm rock steady, I'm still shaking  
I'm ready for the taking  
So make your move, yeah, make me  
And get ready for the big "see"  
  
Let it rock, yeah  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it go  
You gotta let it rock, come on  
Let it roll, yeah just let it go  
  
Slow down, hold on  
You're too fast, you're too strong  
Take it easy, take it slow  
Make it last, don't let go  
We're one body, it's one way  
You're not leaving, c'mon stay  
So get down on your knees  
And let me know you're eager to please  
  
Let it rock, yeah  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it go  
You gotta let it rock, come on  
Let it roll, yeah just let it go  
  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
  
Cool woman, cool eyes  
You got me hypnotized  
Slow down, hold on  
You're too fast, too strong  
I need a woman, a woman to love  
One good woman  
And you got what I want, what I want  
  
Slow down, hold on  
You're much too fast, you're much too strong  
Take it slow, make it last  
Take it easy, not too fast  
Don't let go  
  
No, I'm rock steady, but still shaking  
No, I'm rock steady, but still shaking  
And I'm ready for the taking  
So make your move, yeah make me  
And get a-ready for the big "see", yeah  
  
Let it rock, let it  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it  
Let it, let it rock  
Let it, let it roll  
Let it, let it go  
Let it go  
  
Let it rock, yeah  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it go  
You gotta let it rock, come on  
Let it roll, yeah  
Let it go
