Elizabeth dreams  
Of the day  
When the way  
That I looked at her  
Made her feel  
She was real  
  
Elizabeth dreams  
Of the time  
She was mine  
When she didn't need any more  
She was sure  
She was sure  
  
Out of sight ??  
By candlelight ??  
And see green ??  
And see green horses ??  
I said she's out of sight ??  
By candlelight ??  
And fairy ??  
Fairy stories ??  
Elizabeth is not what she seems  
Elizabeth dreams  
Elizabeth dreams  
  
Elizabeth dreams  
Holding fast  
Through the past  
When a morning  
Was something new  
Flowers grew  
  
Elizabeth dreams  
But it's late  
And she waited too long  
And tomorrow goes  
Now she knows  
Now she knows  
  
Out of sight ??  
By candlelight ??  
And see green ??  
And see green horses ??  
I said she's out of sight ??  
By candlelight ??  
And fairy ??  
Fairy stories ??  
Elizabeth is not what she seems  
Elizabeth dreams  
Elizabeth dreams  
Elizabeth dreams  
  
Elizabeth dreams  
Elizabeth dreams  
Elizabeth dreams
