I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)  
He thinks I'm beat  
I'm coming off the ropes yea  
This ain't no retreat  
He thinks I'm going down  
For sure my head is spinning round  
When I straighten up  
But I'm going to knock him off his feet!  
(Wow suckerpunch!  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)  
Yes I'm coming off the ropes  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
He made me angry now  
I only need to straighten up  
I'm going to show him how  
I can hear someone count to ten  
Seems like a lifetime,  
But I'll tell you when  
I know I'm safe down here  
So till then, must have been  
A lucky swing  
Two years ago,  
I would have not let him in  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)
