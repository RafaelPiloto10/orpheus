When the train pulls in the station you'll be waiting by the track  
You're havin' trouble sleepin' nights you want me to come back  
But that old train will roll on by, you'll know I never came  
While I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains  
That one way track to no man's love I'll never ride again  
I used to lie awake at night callin' out your name  
Now I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
Your standin' in the station I can see you in my mind  
You think that I'll forgive again, but you're so wrong this time  
Your sleepless eyes and selfish heart are waiting there in vain  
While I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains  
That one way track to no man's love I'll never ride again  
I used to lie awake at night callin' out your name  
Now I sleep good and miss a lot of trains
