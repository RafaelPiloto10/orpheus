(Written and sung by Tre Cool)  
  
I got a rock n' roll band  
I got a rock n' roll life  
I got a rock n' roll girlfriend  
And another ex-wife  
  
I got a rock n' roll house  
I got a rock n' roll car  
I play the shit out the drums  
And I can play the guitar  
  
I got a kid in New York  
I got a kid in the Bay  
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'  
In over 22 days  
  
So get off of my case  
Get off of my case  
  
Off of my case!
