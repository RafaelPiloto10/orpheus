I remember thinking love was a fool's game  
Break your heart you've got your own self to blame  
I've played it smart so many times but that all changed  
From the moment you were mine  
People fall in love and swear they are so sure  
Then they turn around and say it's over  
I never trusted love to come any closer  
'Till the moment you were mine  
Refrain:  
One moment in time  
And I knew I had waited so long  
One look in your eyes  
Meant forever from that moment on  
I used to dreamed somebody's arms were around me  
Wake up all alone and feel so empty  
No I never dreamed how real love could be  
'Till the moment you were mine  
Instrumental  
(Repeat Refrain)  
'Till the moment you were mine.
