Bin Laden And The Jets (Benny And The Jets)  
  
Hey kids have you see Osama  
We haven't heard a thing  
Since he telephoned his mama  
  
We checked his favorite cave, he didn't stick around  
  
We're gonna have to send some troops to hunt the bastard down  
  
Hey Taliban clerics, gonna make them sweat  
They're gonna need those towels  
B-B-B-Bin Laden and the jets  
  
Radicals think that he's wonderful  
Al-Queda thinks he's really keen  
He's got a bunch of goofs that he calls troops  
You know he's sponsored by a puppet regime ohhh  
  
B-B-Bin Laden and the jets  
  
Binny,  
Binny,  
Binny,  
Bin Laden and the jets  
Jets  
Jets
