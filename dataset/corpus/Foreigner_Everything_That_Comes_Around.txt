Goodbye is a dangerous game to play  
It breaks your heart and tears your life away  
You say it's over and that's the end  
With no last kiss, and no kind words like friends  
  
But I'm gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will work out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
D'you think about me now and then?  
And wonder were you wrong and what might have been?  
And seasons come and seasons go  
And what goes up comes down, and baby soon you'll know  
  
I'm gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
So you can go and leave me now  
You see it don't make any difference  
Go on and leave me now  
'Cause you'll be back sometime in my life  
There may be some other ones  
And you might think some better ones  
  
But if I wait my time  
If I stand in line  
It will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
Everything that comes around, (everything) goes around (I'm gonna be here  
Babe)  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
So let it turn around  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, (everything) comes around (someday) someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around, oh-oh-aaah  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday, yeah
