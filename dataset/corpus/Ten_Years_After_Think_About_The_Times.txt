Think about the times when you're happy  
Think about the times when you're sad  
Think about the life you're living  
Think about your life and be glad  
  
You are living  
You are in the world  
And your life belongs to you  
  
You are living  
You are of the earth  
And the earth is of you, too  
  
There'll be times when you're lonely  
There'll be times when you're down  
There are times when you remember  
With a smile or a frown  
  
You are living  
You are in the world  
And your life belongs to you  
  
You are living  
You are of the earth  
And the earth is of you, too
