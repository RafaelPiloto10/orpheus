Hearts of fire creates love desire  
Take you high and higher to the world you belong  
Hearts of fire creates love desire  
High and higher to your place on the throne  
We've come together on this special day  
To sing our message loud and clear  
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days  
Future, past they disappear  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look way down in your heart and soul  
Ah, don't hesitate, 'cause the world seems cold  
Stay young at heart, 'cause you'll never, never grow old at heart, hey  
(Never, never, never, never know)  
As the way of the world, pledge a flower would you grow a pearl  
A child is born with a heart of gold  
Way of the world makes his heart so cold, oh, yeah  
Hearts of fire, love desire  
Hearts of fire creates love desire  
Take you high and higher to the world you belong  
Hearts of fire, love desire, high and higher you, you, you  
Hearts of fire, love desire, high and higher, ooh  
We've come together on this special day  
To sing our message loud and clear  
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days  
Well, future disappear  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look way down in your heart and soul  
Ah, don't hesitate 'cause the world seems cold  
Stay young at heart and you'll never, never grow old at heart

Hearts of fire, oh, love desire, oh yeah  
Hearts of fire creates love desire  
Take you high and higher to the world you belong  
Hearts of fire creates love desire  
High and higher to your place on the throne
