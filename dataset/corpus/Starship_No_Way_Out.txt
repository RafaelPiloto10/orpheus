No intentions  
Whatsoever  
I was gone for a night  
Nothing's forever  
The cruel daylight  
Brought me back to my senses (Back to my senses)  
Got caught in here  
Under false pretenses  
  
No way out  
None whatever  
I made up the story  
Thought it was clever  
She didn't ask  
And I got no reply (Got no reply)  
But later that night  
I heard her cry  
  
[Chorus]  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
  
No accusations  
Whatsoever  
But can she forget  
Nothing's forever  
Since yesterday  
She's a little bit colder (Little bit colder)  
Won't happen again  
What could I've told her  
  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
Doesn't buy my story  
  
How can she tell the truth from the lies  
When does she know when to close her eyes  
She doesn't want to lose me  
So she only sees what she wants to see  
  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out, no way  
No way out
