I awake to find no peace of mind  
I said how do you live as a fugitive  
Down here where I cannot see so clear  
I said, what do I know  
Show me the right way to go  
  
And the spies came out of the water  
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know  
But the spies hide out in every corner  
You can't touch them no, 'cause they're all spies  
They're all spies  
  
I awake to see that no one is free  
We're all fugitives  
Look at the way we live  
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear no  
I said, which way do I turn  
Oh I forget everything I learn  
  
But the spies came out of the water  
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know  
The spies hide out in every corner  
But you can't touch them no  
'Cause they're all spies  
They're all spies  
  
And if we all hide here  
They're going to find us  
If we don't hide now  
They're going to catch us where we sleep  
And if we don't hide here  
They're going to find us  
  
And spies came out of the water  
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know  
Though spies hide out in every corner  
They can't touch you no  
'Cause they're just spies  
They're just spies
