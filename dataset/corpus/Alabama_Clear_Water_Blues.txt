Clear water blues, thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues driftin' along  
Nowhere to go, now that you're gone  
My lonely heart don't know what to do  
With these clear water blues  
  
Lookin' out across the ocean  
Blue is all I see  
And it seems like no matter how far I go  
Your memory just won't set me free  
  
Clear water blues won't leave me alone  
Keeps on remindin' me why you're gone  
My reflection is showin' a fool  
In these clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues, still thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
These clear water blues
