I'm going home  
There I am there, in my bedroom  
I'm safe and I'm snug and snoring  
And so glad to be there.  
  
I'm going home  
None of this ever happened  
But, God, I really did it  
Still nothing has changed.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going home  
I'm going home  
To my own room  
To all the mess  
To all the dirty laundry  
It looks so good I don't care  
I'm just so glad to be home, sweet home  
  
Wonder if anyone missed me?  
Or have I been gone so far  
They thought that I died  
How many said  
I wonder what happened to Alice?  
How many shrugged, or laughed,  
How many cried,  
But I don't give a damn!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm going home  
Nothing can stop me now  
(repeat)
