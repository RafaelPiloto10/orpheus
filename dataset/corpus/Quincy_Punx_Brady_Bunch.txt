Mr. Brady in a martial spat killed Mrs. Brady with a baseball bat  
Now in prison his debt will be paid he left six kids with  
A drug addicted maid, Alice shoots smack every day of the week,  
The kids went wild and they turned into freaks  
One day they cooked tiger up for lunch, that's what happened to the Brady
Bunch  
[Chorus:]  
They didn't just go into sindication  
They practiced all sorts of deviation  
The Brady Bunch Gregs in the big house for sellin' coke, every night he  
Gets his corn hole poked, Marsha's livin' way down in Mexico  
She makes her living in a donkey show, Pete found a job  
As a side show geek, bites the heads off of chickens  
While they squak and sqeek, Jan found her self, now  
Shes a dyke shes got tatooz leather boots and a  
Motor bike  
[Chorus:]  
Bobby was a minister on television  
Now he's facing life in prison, molested little kids and he  
Fucked a goat, stole a million dollars and sailed away on  
A boat, Cindy ended up bein' my bitch shes out on the street  
Corner maken me rich, evernight I stick my dick in her  
Face and tie her little blonde big tails around my waist  
[Chorus:]
