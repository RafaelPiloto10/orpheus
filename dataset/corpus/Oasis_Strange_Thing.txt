Here lives a pocket full of lives with no future  
Take it for what it is, it's only drunken lies  
You should open up your mind, look to the future  
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home  
I'm going home  
  
What would you give me for the songs that I've been singing  
How could you ever say that you've got more than me?  
Mick say's that he can never get no satifaction  
These day's I think I know exactly what he means  
What does he mean?  
  
You won't get  
You don't get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing  
  
You won't get  
You don't get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing now  
  
Here lives a pocket full of lives with no future  
Take it for what it is, it's only drunken lies  
You should open up you mind, look to the future  
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home  
I'm going home  
  
You won't get  
You don't get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing  
  
You won't get  
You don't get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing now
