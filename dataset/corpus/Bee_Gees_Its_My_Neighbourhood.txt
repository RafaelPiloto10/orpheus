Don't get too close to me, don't overreact  
You're not the enemy as a matter of fact  
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore  
Gonna stick by you, gonna stumble over what to do  
  
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything  
I want it, good loving, bring out the beast in me  
I want it, good loving,wanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if you disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if you disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why  
  
So many tell you that you can't win  
It's a battle if you're lonely or if you're starting over  
Two-fisted and fast on your feet  
And you know there's something more  
And the city kicks it out of you and  
  
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything  
I want it, good loving, bring out the worst in me  
I want it, good loving, wanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if  
(Trouble)  
You disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why
