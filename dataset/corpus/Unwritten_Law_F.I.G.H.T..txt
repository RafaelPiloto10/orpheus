I heard you were concerned with my life  
I heard you had a lot to say  
  
Motherfuckin', thanks for nothin'  
  
I'm gonna do it if it feels right  
I'm gonna do it anyway  
  
Motherfuckin', thanks for comin'  
  
Well I'm sayin'  
Don't sa I'm not all right  
I'm used and confused and  
I'm still puttin up a good fight  
I'm still puttin' up a good  
  
F.I.G.H.T., fight, fight, fight  
  
Everybody thinks they know my problems  
Everybody knows what's best for me  
  
Don't think that anyone can solve them  
Don't think there's anyone but me
