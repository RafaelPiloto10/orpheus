You can run you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
You can run you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
Here's how it goes  
You and me  
Up and down  
But maybe this time  
We'll get it right  
Worth the fight  
Cause love isn't something you can shake  
  
When it breaks all it takes is some trying  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
So if you go  
You should know  
It's hard to just forget the past  
So fast  
  
It was good  
It was bad,  
But it was real  
And that's all you have  
In the end our love mattered  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
Here's how it goes  
All it takes is some trying  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love
