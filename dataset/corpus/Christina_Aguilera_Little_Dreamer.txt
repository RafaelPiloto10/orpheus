Look at the stars, I will take one down for you  
No matter what the distance, I'll see it through  
I'll fill you in between the sun and moon  
'Til the end I'll be waiting  
  
And whenever in night, the lights go down  
I know that you'll go on to shine somehow  
And even if you're miles above the clouds  
'Til the end I'll be waiting  
  
Now I lay you down to sleep  
I pray we'll meet inside my dreams  
  
So long, my little dreamer, I'll miss your face  
We'll always stay connected through time and space  
The journey that we shared but now have to leave  
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah  
  
Little dreamer,  
Little dreamer,  
Little dreamer,  
Little dreamer  
Lalala  
  
Look through the dark, there's a compass in the sky  
If ever you're lonely and question why  
Remember that I'm always by your side  
'Til the end I'll be waiting  
  
And even though we sleep like years apart  
The galaxy away is not so far  
Because we know the future is our dark  
'Til the end I'll be waiting  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray we'll meet inside my dreams  
If I should go before I wake I pray our souls will join again  
  
So long, my little dreamer, I'll miss your face  
We'll always stay connected through time and space  
And everything we hoped that could never be  
Will live inside of us for eternity  
  
So come on my little dreamer, I'll miss your face  
We'll always stay connected through time and space  
The journey that we shared but now have to leave  
Will live inside of us for eternity  
  
Destiny will be a part of you, babe (will be)  
I'll feel you in the atmosphere (I'll feel you)  
And nothing will be left to fear (nothing left to fear)  
  
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, said)  
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh oh)  
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, ooh)  
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, ooh)  
  
So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face  
We'll always stay connected through time and space (little dreamer)  
And everything we hoped that could never be (so mamma)  
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah (I'll see you there)  
  
So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face (always, always)  
We'll always stay connected through time and space (ooh oh)  
The journey that we shared but now have to leave (ooh)  
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah (oh ah)  
  
I will be with you till the end  
Mmm, always be waiting 'till the end
