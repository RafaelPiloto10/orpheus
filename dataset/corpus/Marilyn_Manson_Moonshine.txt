I took a walk in the park  
It was scary and dark  
I looked up at the moon  
And I wasn't afraid  
I wasn't afraid  
She's so bright tonight  
Shining trough the trees  
She's glowing on you  
Take a walk with me  
You can walk with me in the  
Moonshine  
If you look at the moon  
When I look at the moon  
We're not far away  
We're connected by the moon  
Looking at the moon in the  
Moonshine
