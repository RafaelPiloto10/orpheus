Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
But I just can't remember who to send it to  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
Won't you look down upon me jesus  
You gotta help me make a stand  
You just got to see me through another day  
My body's achin' and my time is at hand  
I won't make it any other way  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
I've been walkin' my mind to an easy time  
My back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around  
But there's hours of time on the telephone line  
To talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now now now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again
