Everybody it's a good thing  
Everybody wants a good thing  
Everybody ain't it true that  
Everybody's looking for the same thing  
  
Ain't it true there's just no doubt  
There's some things that you can't do without  
And that's good  
Ain't it true as the sun that shines  
You got yours and you got mine  
And that's good  
  
Everybody just like you it's true  
Everybody wants a good thing too  
  
Everybody it's a good thing  
Everybody wants a good thing  
Everybody ain't it true that  
Everybody's looking for the same thing  
  
Ain't it true there's room for doubt  
Maybe some things that you can do without  
And that's good  
  
Everybody just like you it's true  
Everybody wants a good thing too  
  
Now let's have a great big hand  
For everybody who can understand  
Life's a bee without a buzz  
It's going great till you get stung  
And let us not forget to toast  
Everyone who might have missed the boat  
And to everybody else who waits  
Until the next one sails in again  
  
[Repeats]  
Everybody it's a good thing  
Ain't it true it's a monumental good thing
