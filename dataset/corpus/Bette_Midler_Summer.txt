Twas a hot afternoon, the last day of June  
And the sun was a demon  
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade  
And the pavements were steaming  
  
I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet  
I needed time for some thinking  
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye  
And I swore it was winkin'  
  
She was thirty-one and I was seventeen  
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything  
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing  
And wondered what the coming night would bring  
  
The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky  
And it started to swelter  
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown  
And I thought it would melt her  
  
She threw back her hair like I wasn't there  
And she sipped on a Julep  
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare  
When I looked at her two lips  
  
And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say  
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say  
But stay with me until the sun has gone away  
And I will chase the boy in you away  
  
And then she smiled and we talked for a while  
Then we walked for a mile to the sea  
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand  
But I saw the sunrise as a man  
  
Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye  
But the memory lingers  
I go back in my mind to the very first time  
And feel the touch of her fingers
