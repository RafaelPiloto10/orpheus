Try to understand  
I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny  
You go with me everywhere  
When I'm dreamin' you still share my lonely nights  
Try to see my side  
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun  
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm  
  
And as I wander to the cities and the towns  
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to comprehend  
I'm not your ordinary friend at the end of my life  
I would pray that I could be  
Returning to the shelter of your love  
Try to see my side  
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun  
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm  
  
And as I wander to the cities and the towns  
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to understand  
I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny  
You go with me everywhere  
Like a shadow in the gloom  
I remember all the good times  
There's a ghost in every room
