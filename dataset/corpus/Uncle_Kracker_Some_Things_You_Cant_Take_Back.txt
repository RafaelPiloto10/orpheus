Well she was lookin out the window  
And I was starin at the door  
The dog was sleepin on the sofa  
This place has never been this quiet before  
You can't pretend it never happened  
You can't pretend it's still the same  
You can't say you were only jokin'  
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Some things you can't take back  
Though you wish you could  
Some things you can''t take back  
Though the glass has been broke  
And the milk has been spilled  
And your loves on the line  
Some things you can't take back  
When someone says there's no tomorrow  
When the writings on the wall  
After all have cried and spoken  
And your poor heart has taken such a fall  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS ]  
If I could reset the clock and go back in time  
I'd erase the thoughts that went through my mind  
You know I never would leave  
And I'd still have you with me  
You can't pretend it never happened  
You can't pretend it's still the same  
You can't say you were only jokin'  
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS ]  
Some things you can't take back  
'Cause in the cold light of day the pieces all blew away  
And now I'm livin' a lie  
Some things you can't take back
