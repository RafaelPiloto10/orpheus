If it's a Malibu beat, subject of discussion  
Malibu beat, subject of discuss-cussion  
You're motivated-vated, to aid a percussion-cussion  
There's no glo-glory, for this story-story  
It-it rock-rock in any territory-tory  
I syncopate it and design it well-well  
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels  
All techniques are a combination  
Of skills that I have, thought narration  
  
Last year my melody, but still complete  
Providing musical energy for the street  
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect  
Jump track patt-erns on cass-ette  
Time-time snare had bass and cymbal  
Like that of a cat on the mic I'm nimble  
Ba-sic patterns, grouped and changed  
Se-quence fre-quent, seek and gain,  
Break, break, for narration  
  
Break two, break two  
  
I'm in the center of a, I'm in the center of a  
Musical skinner, some say the skins is a blow of torture  
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me  
I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry  
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands  
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll  
Give you a lift, no need to sniff  
No butts no how's no why's or if's  
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated  
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it  
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower  
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower  
I need a beat-beat  
  
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought  
You're bein'-being taken-taken, the musical boom  
I'm in full treating your eardrums  
Increasing the rate of vibration  
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know  
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show  
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures  
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure  
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist  
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist  
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user  
A million or more screaming people abuser  
I predict, this jam will hit  
The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi, wealth and fame  
The total propulsion, of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes  
Have to be very acute, education level high  
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track, culminating on wax  
The tape has slack, rewind then back  
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MC's to duel  
  
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard  
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!  
Cut Creator!
