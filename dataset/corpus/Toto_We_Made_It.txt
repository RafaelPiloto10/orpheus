Bad time for love - you caught me on your birthday  
I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces  
We were too torn apart, now it seems so senseless  
And if we're clever, we'll put it together, it may be forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again  
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again  
  
Down on my luck, you arrived just in time, my angel  
Thought you'd given me up, like a rhyme that needs no reason  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cause it may be forever  
  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cause it may be forever  
  
If ever we'll make it, we're gonna make it girl  
And I know we can take it, we got to take it, girl  
  
If ever we can make it, we gotta make it  
And I know we can take it...
