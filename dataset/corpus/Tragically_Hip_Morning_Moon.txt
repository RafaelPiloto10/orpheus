The reactor's down  
I guess for Labour Day, today  
It's the first day I ain't seen  
A great plume of steam from across the lake  
From across the lake  
Hey, that's a morning moon, yeah.  
  
I'm not making strain  
Said, "Someone's paying  
When something's too cheap  
Somebody's paying something"  
You said, "Some one's paying something."  
Under a morning moon, yeah  
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better, yeah  
  
It didn't take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
To say one little thing that could make me feel better  
Under this morning moon, yeah  
  
The sun's a light bulb and the moon is a mirror  
There are times when you can see both the bulb and the mirror  
See the bulb and the mirror  
And that's the morning moon, yeah  
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better  
  
It doesn't take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
Just saying one little thing trying to make you feel better  
Under this morning moon, yeah  
Under this morning moon  
  
Morning moon, yeah  
Trying to make you feel better  
Nothing too far from the truth
