Oh! Say, can you see,  
By the dawns early light,  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,  
Thru' the perilous flight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rockets' red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof thro' the night  
That our flag was still there.  
Oh! Say, does that star spangled banner  
Yet wave.  
O'er the land of the free  
And the home of the brave.
