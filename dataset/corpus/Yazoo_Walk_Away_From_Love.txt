Move along you're in my way.  
I've made my mind up not to stay  
And it don't matter what you do  
'cause me, I've had enough of you.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there's no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey baby, don't walk away from love  
Tell me baby, ain't my love enough,  
Listen to the things I say  
And tell me why do you walk away from love?  
  
Leave you standing on your own  
It's time I spent some time alone  
Need a while to think this out  
Not sure what it's all about.  
And it's no use to sit there crying  
'cause I can see you're only lying.  
Now I'll put the past behind me  
Run some place where you can't find me.  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bags are packed, I just can't wait.  
Gotta get out before it gets too late,  
I don't need you any more  
And I don't need your love for sure.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember when I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't walk away from love
