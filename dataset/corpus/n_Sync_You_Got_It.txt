Oh, right now baby  
As soon as the stars shine  
I'm gonna make you mine, oh baby  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
(You got it, I need it)  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
  
Let me tell you how I feel  
I need your lovin' girl, give it to me  
Never met a girl like you  
I know you'll like the crazy things we'll do  
(The crazy thing we'll do)  
  
Walking slowly through the rain  
Without worries there's no pain  
When you see a shooting star  
All your problems seem so far  
If you feel true love and trust  
Girl just give me all you got  
'Cause girl you got the love I need  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
Whatever it takes  
(You got it, I need it)  
You got it, I need it  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
  
You are in my dreams at night  
Whatever I do, you're always on my mind  
I can't wait until the day  
When you and me are one in love to stay  
  
Walking slowly through the rain  
Without worries there's no pain  
When you see a shooting star  
All your problems seem so far  
If you feel true love and trust  
Girl, just give me all you've got  
Girl you got the love I need  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
Whatever it takes  
(You got it, I need it)  
I need it  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
  
You got it, yeah  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
(You got it, I need it)  
You got it  
Your love is what make my heart break  
  
(Just give me all your love)  
(Got to have all your love)  
(Just give me all your love)  
'Cause your love is what make my heart break  
(Got to have your love)  
(Just give me all your love)  
(I got to have all your love)  
(Just give me all your love)  
'Cause I got what you need, baby  
(Got to have your love)  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
'Cause I got to have your love baby  
(You got it, I need it)  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
Give me your love
