Funnin' round Grandpa's farm  
Really groovin' on the baby pigs  
Oh, I know they haven't even read the books I know  
Yeah, I understand the telephone  
But I really love to watch you talk your talk  
I love to watch you  
  
Maybe we're better off  
I feel young dancing with you  
  
It happened all by itself  
  
What are we browning here for?  
Haven't we seen through this whole thing yet  
Gonna get together gonna write us a book  
Call it, 'Stop Running The World'  
Look like I'm back in business all over again  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Looking at you, looking at you there  
  
Little better, it happened all by itself  
  
I see that time is fast  
I see the same hands on that same clock move  
Way too slow  
I'll quit talking about mys  
I swear I'll quit talking about myself  
Maybe you can whisper enough here  
So I can start thinking about you  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Sure right looking at you  
  
Let's not confuse association  
Something we both really like  
I swear I quit talking  
I swear I quit talking about myself  
Just as soon as I learn to stop talking at all  
  
It would be better off  
Just feel you thinking about you ?  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Feel good looking at you
