Hey you, see me, pictures crazy,  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
I've got, nothing, to gain, to lose,  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore.  
  
Hey you, are me, not so pretty,  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
Silent my voice, I've got no choice  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore  
I don't see, anymore,  
I don't hear, anymore,  
I don't speak anymore,  
I don't feel.  
  
Hey you, see me, pictures crazy,  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
I've got, nothing, to gain, to lose,  
All the world I've seen before me passing by,  
  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore,  
You don't care about how I feel,  
I don't feel it anymore  
I don't sleep, anymore,  
I don't eat, anymore,  
I don't live anymore,  
I don't feel.
