My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
  
A hard hearted woman  
A hard hearted woman true  
My baby don't love me  
My baby don't love me  
  
Oh baby, let the flags fly at half mast  
Let this darkened hour drift past  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
All my tears are falling  
Slow blues is calling  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, go tell this crazy world the true tale  
Please let loose this lover's ship to sail  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
You don't know how much I love you  
Oh no no no no no  
  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad
