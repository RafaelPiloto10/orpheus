Everything 'round them is spinning and turning  
But they can't understand  
People around me just never stop learning  
About the things that I've planned  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got a way, way of my own  
Just look around them they better start thinking  
People will lend a hand  
They better watch it or else they'll start sinking  
With their heads in the sand  
  
I've got a way, way of my own  
Come back, when you've time for the world  
You must think they'd don't need anyone, no no  
Come back, when you've time for the world  
They might find what they're looking for  
They might find what they're looking for  
  
I can't believe that the reason they're giving  
Will entice me to go  
Why they deny me the right to start living  
I'll just never know  
  
I've got a way, way of my own  
  
[Chorus]
