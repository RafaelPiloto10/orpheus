Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean  
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion  
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube  
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube  
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body  
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie  
See, I want to get loose with you, is that all right?  
Girl, I want to' do it outside, under the moonlight  
And get on down so we can make that love  
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove  
This is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..  
Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine  
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine  
Oh yeah, you like it like that  
You like it like I do and that's where it's at  
So later on that night as we got in my car  
It started up again we didn't get very far  
You made it very clear that you were not in fear  
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear  
Oh girl, you feel so good  
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood  
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway  
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way  
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes  
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose  
Closer and closer, hot anticipation  
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and  
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact  
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack  
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Come on baby and let me be your toy  
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy  
And get down, I know you want to' get loose  
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose  
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time  
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine  
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest  
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best  
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah  
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot  
This is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
O yea...Life is just a fantasy...Oh girl...
