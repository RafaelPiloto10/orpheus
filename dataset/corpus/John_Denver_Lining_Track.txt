Mo boys, is you right  
Done got it right  
All I hate about linin' track  
These ol' boys are gonna break my back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
See Eloise gonna line 'em track  
  
Down in the holler below the fleld  
Angels working on the chariot wheel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary and the babe was a sittin' in the shade  
Thinking on the money that I ain't made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Gotta batten down the waves with a two by four  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now if I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock where Moses stood  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John  
All them disciples dead and gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mo boys, is you right  
Done got it right  
All I hate about lining track  
These ol' boys about to break my back  
  
[Chorus]
