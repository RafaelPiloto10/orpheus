I bought this rhinestone suit in California  
These boots came all the way from Mexico  
This Cadillac ain't nothin' son you ought to see the Greyhound  
I bought to take my band from show to show  
Seen my face a thousand times on TV and heard me on your local radio  
And in your eyes I see the admiration there for me  
But son there's something that you ought to know  
  
Well I've got to take a drink to keep from shakin'  
Motel rooms ain't nothing like a home  
Money can't make love grow any stronger when you leave your woman home alone  
She can't raise the children with no daddy  
She can't love a man that's always gone  
It takes a whole lot more than pride to keep your feelings locked inside  
While you sing another pretty country song  
(Play it Pete Drake)  
[ steel ]  
(I've seen your face a thousand times on TV I've heard you on my local radio)  
  
It's true I took some pills to stay awake son  
And this diamond ring I wear is just for show  
I've got a little cabin in the country  
When I'm not on the road that's where I go  
Try and put my feelings down on paper  
Right or wrong the show has to go on  
I can cry down deep inside and keep on smilin'  
While I sing another pretty country song  
But I've got to take a drink to keep from shakin'
