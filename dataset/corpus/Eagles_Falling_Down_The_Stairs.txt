I don't know what you say  
Every single holy day,  
Never in my life I see  
How can it be, what's it for me?  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every what's his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What, how can it be?  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
(Its not like this)  
Cos I'm falling down the stairs, Help me cos I've got no grip, oh help me
please  
(And I fall)  
  
She left me, I can't see  
I'm blind  
Help me I'm so strong  
And then I lose my mind  
I want to be there but you cannot see me, with I know what's in your head  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every what's his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What, how can it be?  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
(Its not like this)  
Cos I'm falling down the stairs, Help me cos I've got no grip  
(And I fall)
