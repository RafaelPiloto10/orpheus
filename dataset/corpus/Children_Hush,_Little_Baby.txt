Hush, little baby, don't say a word,  
Mama's going to buy you a mockingbird.  
And if that mockingbird don't sing,  
Mama's going to buy you a diamond ring.  
And if that diamond ring turns brass,  
Mama's going to buy you a looking glass.  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Mama's going to buy you a billy goat.  
And if that billy goat won't pull,  
Mama's going to buy you a cart and bull.  
And if that cart and bull turn over,  
Mama's going to buy you a dog named Rover.  
And if that dog named Rover won't bark,  
Mama's going to buy you a horse and cart.  
And if that horse and cart fall down,  
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
