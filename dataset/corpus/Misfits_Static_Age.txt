Static, static, static  
We're on a video rage  
Static, static, static  
We're on a video rage  
  
We're all blue from projection tubes  
We're all blue from projection tubes  
  
This is the static age we live in  
Our eyes criss-cross, hold and gaze  
This is the static age we live in  
Breathe in  
Catch your radiation blue disease and turning, tossing  
  
This is a static age  
Our very static age  
This is a static age  
  
Static, static, static  
We're on a video rage  
Static, static, static  
We're on a video rage  
  
And we're all blue from projection tubes  
We're all blue from projection tubes
