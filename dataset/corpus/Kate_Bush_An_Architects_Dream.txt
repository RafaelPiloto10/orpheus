Watching the painter painting  
And all the time, the light is changing  
And he keeps painting  
That bit there, it was an accident  
But he's so pleased  
It's the best mistake, he could make  
And it's my favorite piece  
It's just great  
  
The flick of a wrist  
Twisting down to the hips  
So the lovers begin, with a kiss  
In a tryst  
It's just a smudge  
But what it becomes  
In his hands  
Curving and sweeping  
Rising and reaching  
I could feel what he was feeling  
Lines like these have got to be  
An architect's dream  
  
It's always the same  
Whenever he works on a pavement  
It starts to rain  
And all the time  
The light is changing
