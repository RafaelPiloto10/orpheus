They say just once in life  
You find someone that's right  
But the world looks so confused  
I can't tell false from true  
And love's so hard to find  
In this state of mind  
Oh I hope I'll know him  
I hope I'll know him  
If he's ever near  
Well it seemed the time had come  
I thought you were the one  
When I looked into your eyes  
It never looked like lies  
And love's so hard to see  
When it's in front of me  
Oh I hope I'll know it  
I hope I'll know it  
If it's ever near  
And love's so hard to see  
When it's in front of me  
Oh I hope I'll know it  
I hope I'll know it  
If it's ever near  
Well I know that in my time  
I'll have it sweet and fine  
But it won't add up to much  
Unless I feel his touch  
And love's so hard to find  
So I guess I'll just give up trying  
Oh I hope I'll know him  
I hope I'll know him  
If he's ever near
