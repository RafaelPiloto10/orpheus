Goodnight my sun  
Goodnight my friend  
Rest your soul at this  
Long day's end  
  
The fire inside  
Will warm our night  
And Daddy's arms will  
Hold you tight  
  
Dream of summer skies  
Sunset is bound to each sunrise  
Rest is your first right  
My friend goodnight  
  
This world spinning  
Time always winning  
The silver chains keep thinning and  
This is just your beginning  
  
Sleep my friend  
At last be free  
No we won't forget  
Our merriest melody  
  
Gone to another place  
Of carousel rides round an angel's face  
I'm sure we'd both laugh at the sight  
  
My friend goodnight
