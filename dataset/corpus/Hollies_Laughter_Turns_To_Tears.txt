Makeup on your shoulder silence in the air  
Tonight those telltale signs are everywhere  
As you lay beside her talkin' in your dreams  
The game is up and laughter turns to tears  
  
Every time you phone her with a dumb excuse  
She starts to think that she's outgrown her use  
You'll be home by midnight workin' late it seems  
The penny drops and laughter turns to tears  
  
Do you think she's crazy  
Don't you think she knows  
Do you think she's taken in  
Don't you think it shows  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
  
You can send her roses say she's lookin' great  
You can talk of love but it may be too late  
You may think she's jokin' as her laughter teems  
But with tears  
And laughter turns to screams  
  
Now it won't be easy  
Finding words to say  
How you really feel inside  
You take the game away  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
  
One day it's gonna shake you up  
Take you by surprise  
Someday it's gonna wake you up  
Tears in your eyes  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears
