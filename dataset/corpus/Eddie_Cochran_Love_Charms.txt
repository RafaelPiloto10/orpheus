I'm gonna buy some love charms to get you in my arms  
I'm gonna buy some love charms to get you in my arms  
Everytime I'm wavin' in a-your direction  
I'm gonna win your love and effection  
I'd like to bet ya, I'm gonna get ya with my love charms  
  
The first charm's gonna be a heart  
A heart that won't be broken  
The next charm's gonna be a love seat  
Where sweet words can be spoken  
The third charm must be a pair of lips  
That's only meant for me  
The fourth charm's gonna be the month and day  
When the wedding day will be  
  
The fifth charm's gonna be a bar of steel  
To keep our loving strong  
The sixth charm's gonna be a little white dove  
To make peace when things go wrong  
The seventh charm's gonna be a good luck charm  
To last our lifetime through  
String 'em on a bracelet and a one, two, three  
They will bring my love to you
