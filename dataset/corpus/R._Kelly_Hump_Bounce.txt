It's Saturday  
I'm ready to go out and have some fun  
Get in the club around 'bout twelvish  
Me my homies hoochie huntin'  
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin'  
And everybody's on the floor  
Moet, Alize  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin'  
All I wanna do [Repeat: x2]  
Summertime, Saturday night  
  
"Hey, what'cha doin'?  
"Chillin', strokin' the town."  
"Sure you don't wanna come over here?"  
"Nah, I ain't comin' over there, man."  
"What you mean you ain't comin' over here.?"  
"'Cause you don't be talkin' about doing shit."  
"Who you wit?"  
"Don't worry about who I'm wit."  
"See, that's why I don't call you."  
  
It's time to be havin' a good time tonight  
Music got you in the mood, you'll be dancin' all night  
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin' and everybody's on the floor  
I can't seem to stop thinkin' about you, baby  
No matter what I do  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know you're here to party  
Everybody work it out  
Leave all your troubles behind  
Let me see you hump and bounce  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Help me find a way to that spot tonight  
Kelly, won't you help me find a way  
I can help you find a way
