Georgie grew to hate her name  
It sounded like a tiny man  
And the one she had said, "I can't see you  
But I'll call you whenever I can"  
  
Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep  
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions  
Though she often felt cheated  
She never felt cheap  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
It was half-past February  
And he hadn't called since New Year's Day  
Maybe he'd found another woman  
To say those words no chapel girl should say  
  
Her mother would phone and always keep her talking  
She'd try to be polite, making faces  
But somewhere in the back of her mind  
Her rival was stalking  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Her rival would always wait  
'Til the eighth or ninth bell  
He'd be desperate anyway  
And drunk as well  
  
She always liked to hurt him  
To prove he was prepared  
To love her anyway that she wanted  
So she could tell which she preferred  
  
He sat up with his address book  
Trying to think what mood he's in  
His finger traced past Georgie's name  
To someone who needed less persuading  
  
He didn't hear through her disguise  
He didn't leave her in a rush  
Just like the promise that he left  
On her machine that almost made her blush  
  
The radio plays a lover's symphony  
The number you have dialed has been re-directed  
Now she puts him on the speaker-phone  
Whenever she has company  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival
