I need your love so badly  
I love you, oh, so madly  
But I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you!  
I thought at last I'd found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender  
Just for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover  
that I'm the lover, meant for you  
And I'd be true  
But what's the good of scheming  
I Know I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you!
