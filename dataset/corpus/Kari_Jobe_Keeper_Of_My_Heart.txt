From the first to the last breath I breathe  
The Lord watches over me  
You hear my cry and You know every need  
The Lord watches over me  
  
You never fail me, God  
  
I lift my eyes  
I lift my eyes up  
Maker of the Heavens  
Keeper of my heart  
I lift my hands  
I lift my hands up  
Standing in Your presence  
You are never far  
  
I look to You where my help comes from  
The Lord watches over me  
Your mercies are new with the morning sun  
The Lord watches over me  
  
You've never failed me, God  
  
Keeper of my heart  
Keeper of my heart  
Jesus, You are  
  
My strength  
You're never ending love  
I know You have overcome  
I'll sing when all is said and done  
You're my hope, my only hope
