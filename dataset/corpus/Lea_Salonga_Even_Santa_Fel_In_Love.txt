He brushes back his silver hair  
And checks to see if she is standing there.  
After years of traveling round  
With the raindeer hooves above the ground,  
Never made the mrs runaway.  
Remembering the night they met.  
Figure skating she played hard to get.  
In his red suit he sled past.  
Who can resist that charming laugh.  
He said he could teach her how to fly.  
  
Chorus:  
Even santa fell in love  
Everybody needs someone to come home to  
After the longest day  
Even santa fell in love  
And she's the only one he wants to come back to  
When the toys are put away  
  
Bridge: even on christmas day  
  
She sees his eyes are all a glow  
Anticipating children laughing in the snow  
And with just his christmas touch  
Under mistletoe before the rush  
Mrs kringle feels the tingle in the heart.  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Chorus  
Hooo...  
Bridge (2x)
