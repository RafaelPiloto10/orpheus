I've got war on my mind blood on my hands  
And love on my head  
So open your hands open your mouth  
Let it be said  
You know I've got it made in my mind  
Don't waste my time it's not going to change  
So say what you want spit it out loud  
  
And I'll pay no attention  
  
They're gonna tell you where to walk  
When to smile and just what to say  
They say have your own flu  
Make your own mind  
And don't make waves  
But if you got a handful of change  
Don't throw it away it's gonna come  
So say what you want, suck all my  
Suck on my brain
