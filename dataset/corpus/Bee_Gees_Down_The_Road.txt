1974  
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.  
Take it nice and easy mama , chicken on the run and I don't care.  
I'd show my body anywhere.  
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.  
Don't you think that I don't know  
it ain't been a perfect day , but I don't care.  
I'd sell my body anywhere.  
In the name of creation , I can't find an explanation anywhere.  
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.  
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.  
I'd show my feelings anywhere.  
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Down, down the road , up the road (sing 5 times)
