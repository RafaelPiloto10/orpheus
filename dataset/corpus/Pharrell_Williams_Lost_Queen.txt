What planet are you from, girl?  
And are there others like you there?  
And could you do that magic trick again?  
Poppin' up from nowhere  
Though my planet's full of warfare  
You make it feel like a dream  
Man I hope they never find you  
  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Hot sex and gold, shiny things  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen  
  
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'  
Takin' care of you is my number one passion  
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it  
Only if you want it, want it  
You don't have to ever think about askin'  
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it  
Can I start you up? It's automatic  
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom  
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
  
What planet are you from, girl?

I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Hot sex and gold, shiny things  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen  
  
I don't need momma and daddy  
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy  
Half of me is good, the other half nasty  
Can't help it if I want it, want it  
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior  
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player  
And like Geico, the time I saved 'em  
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom  
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it  
Ain't gotta ask me to

I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen
