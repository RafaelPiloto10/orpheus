Avoiding this is like avoiding a plague  
We can't understand the advances we made  
We've tried to resist but it's so hard to say no  
We're pretending to see what the future will hold  
We appear to be in control of our fate  
Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war  
But it's moving so fast we cannot see what we've done  
We're losing our eyes just to say that we've won  
  
My mind's made up, my heart is broke  
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked  
I can't understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received  
  
We never understood the times we asked  
The way we wasted all that passed  
This neglect is final it's a stage we must  
Endure to ever hope to see the first  
My mind's made up about the things we did  
We never saw we believed we couldn't say what we missed  
  
My mind's made up, my heart is broke  
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked  
I can't understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received  
  
By making noises which we cannot control  
The things we hoped that we'd never forgo  
We appear to be in control of our fate  
Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war  
But it's moving so fast we cannot see what we've done  
We're losing our eyes just to say that we've won  
  
My mind's made up, my heart is broke  
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked  
I can't understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received
