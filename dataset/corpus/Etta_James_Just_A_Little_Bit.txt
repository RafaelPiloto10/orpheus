I don't want much, no no  
I just want a little bit  
I don't want it all babe  
I just want a little bit  
Just a [unknown] little bit of your love  
  
Turn your lights down low  
And, honey, slip me a kiss  
Turn your lights down low, baby  
Come on, I can't resist  
I want to a [unknown] little bit of your love  
  
Oh, please right now honey  
I can't wait now  
Baby just gimme, just gimme a little bit of your love now  
I don't want, please, can't wait now  
  
I want you forever  
Not just for peace of mind [unknown]  
Please say you never leave me baby  
Not 'til the end of time  
Oh just a [unknown] bit of your love  
  
Oh gimme [unknown] bit of your love  
I don't want much  
I want a little bit of your love  
Gimme some more, gimme a little taste right now  
Please, please right now, I can't wait  
Baby just a little bit a little bit a little bit, right now right now
