Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me  
  
You're not the first one  
You're not the last one  
You're not even the in between  
You've got the power, this is your hour  
You crawl through Harlem  
On your hands and knees  
It's not the way you look  
The way you walk and the color of your hair  
It's not the way you look  
The way you talk and the color of your hair  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me  
  
Well there is something I feel about you  
A feelin' that just won't let go  
Well in an hour, you have the power  
The power of love over me  
It's not the way you look  
The way you walk and the color of your hair (no)  
It's not the way you look  
The way you talk and the color of your hair  
  
Then you threw it away, you threw it all away  
As you walked right out the door  
You threw it away, you threw it all away  
As you walked right out the door  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
  
It's got a hold on me  
It's got a hold on me  
It's got a hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on me  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me
