I used to live in A room full of mirrors  
All I could see was me  
Well I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors  
Now the whole world is here for me to see  
I said the whole world is here for me to see  
Now I'm searchin' for my love to be  
Hey!!  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!  
  
Broken glass was all in my brain  
Cuttin' screamin' crying in my head  
Broken glass was all in my brain  
Fall in my dreams cut me in my bed  
Fall in my dreams cut me in my bed  
I said A makin' love was strange in my bed  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!  
  
All right  
Ooo ooo  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
No place to stumble  
No place to fall  
Can't find war  
No where at all  
See nothing but sunshine  
All around  
  
Love comes shinin' over the mountains  
Love comes shinin' over the sea  
Love will shine on my baby  
Then I'll know who's exactly for me  
Lord, I'll know who'll be for me  
In the meantime, which is A groovy time
