Befriended, befriended by the King above all Kings  
Surrendered, surrendered to a friend above all friends  
Invited, invited deep into this mystery  
Delighted, delighted by the wonders I have seen  
This will be my story  
This will be my song  
You'll always be my savior.  
Jesus You will always have my heart  
Astounded, astounded that Your gospel beckoned me  
Surrounded, surrounded but I've never been so free,  
Determined, determined now to live this life for You  
You're so worthy my greatest gift would be the least You're due  
This will be my story  
This will be my song  
You'll always be my Savior.  
Jesus You will always have my heart
