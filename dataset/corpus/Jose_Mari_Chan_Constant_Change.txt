We're on the road  
We move from place to place  
And oftentimes when I'm about to call it home  
We'd have to move along  
Life is a constant change...  
  
The friends we know we meet along the way  
Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no  
  
Clouds that move across the skies  
Are changing form before our very eyes  
  
Why couldn't we keep time from movin' on?  
Hold on to all the years before this moment's gone?  
Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace?  
  
We're all like clouds that move across the skies  
And changing form before our very eyes  
  
Have we outgrown our Peter Pans and wings?  
We've simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no
