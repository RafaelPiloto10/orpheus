Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise.  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free.  
  
Blackbird fly (Fly)  
Blackbird fly (Fly)  
Into the light of the dark black night.  
  
Blackbird fly (Fly)  
Blackbird fly (Fly)  
Into the light of the dark black night.  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise.  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
