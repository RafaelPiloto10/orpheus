Where would you be without music  
You would be nowhere at all  
We wouldn't be here doing this now  
If you weren't having a ball  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
  
Can you imagine the silence  
Not even the pink or white noise  
Well thankfully we've got the license  
To have us some fun with the boys  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
  
The melody line's fascinating  
The rhythm is something divine  
It sends our adrenaline racing  
To see you all moving so fine  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
One for the road
