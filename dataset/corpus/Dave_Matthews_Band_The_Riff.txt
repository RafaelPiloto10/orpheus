Funny how time slips away  
Looking at the cracks creeping across my face  
I remember the little kid living in here  
He'll be living here probably until I'm dead.  
  
Please don't leave me, baby  
Please don't leave me yet.  
  
Sitting in a box away from the world out there  
A world piled high with boxes just like this  
But please don't ever leave me alone in here  
Take me out, shake off the dust, shake off the fear.  
  
Please don't leave me, baby  
Please don't leave me yet.  
  
If you stay with me  
That don't mean we gotta stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game  
  
Well I don't know the man that's livin' in my head  
'til you reach down and bring the light back in  
No, I don't know the man that's living in my head  
If I don't know the woman sleeping in my bed.  
  
Remember how we used to kiss, baby  
Kiss like it was everything?  
Remember how we used to love, baby  
Love like it was everything?  
  
You stay with me  
That don't mean we have to stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game  
You stay with me  
I'll follow you and we can start again, baby  
  
I only got a minute or two to spare  
And I gotta whole damn life to fit in there  
So why waste time staring at the T.V. set?  
Like I got dreams to kill and people to forget  
  
Remember how we used to dance, baby  
Just like it was everything?  
  
You stay with me  
And that don't mean we have to stay the same  
You stay with me  
Baby, you and me can make the change  
You stay with me  
But that don't mean I wanna stay the same  
  
You stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game
