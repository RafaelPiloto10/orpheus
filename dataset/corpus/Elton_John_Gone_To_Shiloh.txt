Luther left us first light Friday morning  
Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye  
They're gonna have to share the weight together  
Idle hands will see a good farm slowly die  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Hope springs eternal  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
April's come and the air smells fresh with rain  
They watched his shadow fade around the bend  
He's headed for a different kind of thunder  
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Time passes slowly  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road  
His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free  
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here  
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Men stand united  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
After all of this  
If we should prevail  
Heaven help the South  
When Sherman comes their way
