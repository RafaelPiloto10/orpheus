Catch the play now, eye to eye  
Don't let chances pass you by  
Always someone at your back  
Biding their time for attack  
  
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged  
Double-crossers get your head  
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike  
Kiss of Judas, spider like  
  
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you  
Wolves in sheeps clothing, slow death in consoling  
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected  
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you  
  
Tricksters, jilters play their game  
Sleight-of-handers, all the same  
Masquerader in his lair  
Wants to tangle in your hair
