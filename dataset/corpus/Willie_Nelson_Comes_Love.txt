I can hear the wind blowing in my mind  
Just the way it used to do through the Georgia pines  
And you were there to answer when I called  
You and me, Lord knows, we had it all  
  
Remember how I used to touch your hair, baby  
Looking for the feeling, it was always there  
You're the best thing in my life I can recall  
Yeah baby, you and me, we had it all  
  
I know that we can never live those times again  
And I get old feelings that I'll be there back again  
And I'll stay with you girl just as long as I can  
'Cause it was so good, oh, it was so good, you know  
Yes, it was so good when I was your man  
  
And I'll never stop believing in your smile  
Even though, you didn't stay, it was all worth while  
And I know that beneath of it all, baby  
Just you and me, we had it all  
  
You and me, we had it all  
You and me, we had it all
