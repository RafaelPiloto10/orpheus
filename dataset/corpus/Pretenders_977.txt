Every time I end up waking up  
In some hotel without my  
Set of keys  
Coming to, remembering the way  
Your turned me out when I was  
On my knees  
You think that was  
One up for you  
But I know I scored something too  
  
When I see the way you have to struggle  
Just to do a little simple thing  
I feel apologetic  
Just because I'm not particularly suffering  
So I let you take me down  
I'm like your rent-a-clown  
  
When I saw my baby cry  
I knew that he loved me  
That was some great victory  
He cried because of me  
He hit me with his belt  
But his tears were all I felt  
When I saw my baby cry  
I knew he loved me  
  
When you try and cut me down  
And push me back  
If I attack your attitude  
I rise up to the challenge 'cause  
I like to taste the sugar of your violent mood  
Just like a stormy sea  
You're natural  
Poetry to me  
  
When I saw my baby cry  
I knew that he loved me  
That was some great victory  
He cried because of me  
He hit me with his belt  
But his tears were all I felt  
When I saw my baby cry  
I knew he loved me  
I knew he loved me
