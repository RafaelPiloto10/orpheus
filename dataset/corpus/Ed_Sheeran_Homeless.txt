Could I wake up next to you when it's hitting double figures?  
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors  
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur  
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt  
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides  
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time  
Highbury Estate's fine, smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines  
  
Hey, I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my iPod  
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up, driver turn the lights  
Off  
Lights on, on stage, mics on, song plays, nice one  
Gotta keep my hype strong, truth be, never went to Uni  
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see  
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22,  
Done everything I need to, except get a 2:1  
  
I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
When I feel cold, you keep me warm  
And I'm not looking for some loose change  
Just wanna find a true mate  
Who wants to be my duvet, hey  
  
It's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah
