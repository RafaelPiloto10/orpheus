What's the use of worrying  
If we'll be here tomarrow  
All we need to be is here today  
Don't care if you're rich  
Or if you have to beg and borrow  
You can always find a way  
Dive and breakaway  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high  
  
Mother earth looks peaceful  
As we climb towards the ceiling  
We must be ten thousand feet or more  
Hear the windrush screaming  
While we fight to curb our feelings  
As we stand beside the door  
Let our spirits soar  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high
