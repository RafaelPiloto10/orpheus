Baby, won't you come and tell me  
Tell me what we're gonna do...yeah, baby  
I've tried everything I know just to,  
Just to try and get along with you  
  
Wake up in the morning and already  
You are aimin' for a fight  
No matter what I say or do  
I'm never gonna get it right  
  
But ain't we gettin' kind of tore down  
Always layin' it on the line  
I don't think that when they called it love  
This what they had in mind  
  
[Chorus]  
(Hey) Baby, don't you know that  
I'm on your side  
All you got to do now, darlin...  
  
Take my little heart and open wide  
Hey baby, I know we can work it out  
Might take a little mojo workin, baby  
But ain't that what love is all about?  
  
Hey, Baby, must be somethin bout this  
Push and pull  
Makes me wonder if we stir it up...  
Just to make sure things'll never get dull.  
  
Come on baby take the gloves off  
And then untie those shoes  
I got something more tantalizin  
For you left and right to do  
  
[Chorus]
