Faith-Walkin' People  
By Amy Grant  
Well, it seems with You  
There is something new  
Every time I turn around.  
Oh, I never really know quite what to expect,  
But it won't get me down.  
'Cause I know You bring  
Each and everything  
Just to teach me how to live.  
And the secret of it all is trusting in You,  
And the wisdom You give.  
So say goodbye to the feelings,  
'Cause the feelings go away.  
Say goodbye to the people,  
'Cause the people never stay.  
And say goodbye to the future,  
When it blinds you to today.  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
That's standing in the way,  
Oh, we've got to break away.  
Break away to be  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't rely on everything you feel.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
We must discern what's really real.  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't believe in everything you see.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
Seems like such a mystery.  
Daaa...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dah...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba lat-dah dat dah.  
But in all the earth  
There is nothing worth  
Half as much as life with You.  
'Cause the people and things we're countin' on here,  
They're gonna pass away too.  
But I don't understand  
Everything He's been,  
But I don't really have to know.  
'Cause He's giving me a joy that's filling my heart,  
But I've learned to let go.  
So say goodbye to the feelings,  
'Cause the feelings go away.  
Say goodbye to the people,  
'Cause the people never stay.  
And say goodbye to the future,  
When it blinds you to today.  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
That's standing in the way,  
Oh, we've got to break away.  
Break away to be  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't rely on everything you feel.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
We must discern what's really real.  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't believe in everything you see.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
Seems like such a mystery.  
Daaa...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dah...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dat-dah dat dah.
