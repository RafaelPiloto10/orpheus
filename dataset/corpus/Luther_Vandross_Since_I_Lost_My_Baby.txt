SINCE I LOST MY BABY  
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore  
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)  
  
  
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light  
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright  
But after I've been crying all night  
The sun is cold and the new day seems old  
Since I lost my baby  
Oh since I lost my baby  
  
The birds are singing and the children are playing  
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying  
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying  
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor  
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)  
Oh since I lost my baby  
My baby, my baby, my baby  
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby  
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)  
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)  
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)  
Till I find her I'll be trying to (Till I find her, I'll be trying to)  
Everyday I'm growing kinder  
Tryin'  
Inclined to  
Find her  
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)  
Been looking everywhere (My baby)  
Hey baby I really really care  
  
My determination is fading fast  
So fast, so fast so fast  
Exploration is a thing of the past  
I can't see how my hope's gonna last  
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad  
So sad, so sad, I'm sad, so sad, so sad  
  
Since I lost my baby (since I lost my girl)  
Oh Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)  
I feel so bad, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
I feel so sad, yeah-eh,  
Since I lost my-, since I lost my-, my, my, my, my baby  
Cause everything is gone, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
And it's hard girl, to carry on,  
Since I lost my-, since I lost my-, my, my, my, my baby  
I know it's up to me, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
What's gonna happen to me  
Since I lost my baby  
What's gonna happen to me  
Oh I don't, I don't know, what I'm gonna do no, no, no, no I don't know  
Since I lost my baby,  
I don't know, I don't know, What to do without, my girl, my girl, my girl, I
don't know Since I lost my baby,  
I can't find her no where, no where, no where, no where, no where oh no  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
Yeah, I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where no where, no
where, no where, no where  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where, no where  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where, no where (fade)
