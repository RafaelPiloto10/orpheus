Don't tell me what you can't do  
Never had a hold on you  
And don't tell me where you'd rather be  
Just say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Don't tell me what you can't do, oh no  
  
Give a little, I need a lot  
You never think about what we've got  
Maybe our breakup is long overdue  
If it's over me, it's up to you  
  
Don't make it harder than you need to  
You're old enough to hear the truth  
Don't tell me what you can't do  
  
I'd do anything to make you stay  
I'd be a fool to let you get away  
They say true love never runs smooth  
But when it's gone, what can you do?  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Do what you like, you know that you can, mmm  
  
Don't let her go!  
Maybe I should let her know  
I'll try to be strong  
But it's wrong!  
I'm gonna have to let her go  
If you walk out on me  
I'd be lonely as a man could be  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
Don't tell me what you can't do  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Never had a hold on you  
Tell me you like, you know that you can  
And don't tell me where you'd rather be  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Just say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Girl, you're losing me  
You're losing me  
Just do what you like  
Do what you like, girl  
  
Walk out of me, walk out of me  
Girl you walk out of me  
Say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me
