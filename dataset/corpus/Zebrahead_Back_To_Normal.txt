I'm feeling lost,  
I'm feeling like my heart's  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
  
Awaking and taking the cycle of breaking up  
To a whole new level  
Shaking and faking like you're making a hard choice not to settle  
Imbedded, I'm think headed  
I shredded all the letters you sent  
Don't get it. why'd you let it get this far  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
And I crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
I'll fated,I skated,  
To the party faded,and I saw you there  
I waited, hated, getting ignored  
You stated you didn't care  
Flashes of car crashed and  
Your ashes burning the cement  
The curtain fails, last call, credits roll  
We have reached the end  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save you every time you crash and Burn  
Crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
Tired of fighting  
I'm sick of always trying  
  
I'm feeling lost,  
I'm feeling like my heart's  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
I crash and burn  
I crash and burn
