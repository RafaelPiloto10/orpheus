I can't leave you in the mornin'  
When you wake your childs little head looks so appealin'  
Walking around in your bunny shoes  
And my pajama tops you see that stay home feelin'.  
  
I can't leave you in the night  
'Cause you're afraid to be alone  
And beg these tears to dry  
I could never leave you cryin'  
There must be another way to say goodbye.  
  
Every time I try to pack I double up inside  
Just like the cloths I'm foldin'  
Every empty hanger I put back  
Feels like a cement block my hands are holdin'.  
  
Honey, if it's all the same to you  
I'd love to stay right here at least till you walk by  
Find an easier way of leavin'  
There must be another way to say goodbye.  
  
There must be another way to say goodbye, make the break  
There must be a bypass round the hurting traffic jam to take  
There must be another way to part  
And come unglued each time we start to try  
There must be another way to say goodbye.  
  
There must be another way to say goodbye
