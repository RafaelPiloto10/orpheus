I've been here longer and I'm stronger  
And I've seen as much as any man  
Now many's crossed me but none have bossed me  
And I don't believe they ever can  
Hello son, I see you're wearin' a gun  
And you say, you're on your way into town  
  
You say, your ma told you not to  
But you feel you got to  
Get that man that gunned your daddy down  
From the Sheriff's office to the gallows boy  
That's a mighty mighty short walk  
So, why you worry your horse son?  
  
Let you and I take it easy and have a little talk  
'Cause I've been here longer  
  
Well, I can see that you're angry  
And I guess, you've got plenty right to be  
But the law can handle your daddy's killer  
Much better than you or me  
And remember your promise you made your mother  
That you never would fought on a gun  
  
So go on home to her boy  
'Cause she needs you  
She wouldn't stand to lose her only son  
Well, I see you thought it over  
And I'm glad to see you going home boy  
And you wanna know what they call me  
  
Well, I'm just the river, they call me the Mississippi  
I've been here longer
