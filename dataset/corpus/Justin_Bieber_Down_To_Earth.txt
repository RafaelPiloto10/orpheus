Oh, oh, oh  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how  
No one has a solid answer  
Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's up to you and it's up to me  
That we meet in the middle  
On our way back down to earth  
Down to earth, down to earth  
On our way back down to earth  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
  
Mommy you were always somewhere  
And Daddy I live outta town  
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how  
You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We fell so far away from where we used to be  
Now we're standing, and where do we go  
When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how.
