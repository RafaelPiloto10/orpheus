There you were on the floor cut up  
And all alone I'll help you  
Conceived in a chrome dream I was a crease  
In the shirt that this world wears  
Till I met Blue, I was in obscurity he said  
Loosen up who do you want to be?  
  
We could steal a car and listen to the stars  
I can see you've choked on them too  
Had enough of late night films  
Just enough for an hour or two  
Oh Blue show me something new  
Oh Blue show me something new  
  
Blue, I've got a question every time I hold you  
Yeah, Blue, I've got a question every time I swallow you it's true  
  
Spike danced for 10 days long  
We were just heading for the sun  
You shot him down there's blood on my face  
His heart's in the right place  
What they gonna do to you  
What they gonna do  
Blue don't forget the word I warned you  
Oh Blue don't let them push you don't let them destroy you  
Meanwhile I'm searching with my brain blown eyes  
See the world through my dirty lonely mixed up mind
