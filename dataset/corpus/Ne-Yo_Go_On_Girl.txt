Oh, oh  
Oh, I can't get it back  
But I don't want it back  
I realized that she  
Don't know how to act  
Never been a dumb dude  
No, I'm not dense  
I just had a slight lack of common sense  
I was the good guy  
She was the bad girl  
I'm thinking one girl  
She thinking me, Earl, James, and Jimmy  
Yep, she had plenty  
But love for me, she didn't have any  
  
[Bridge:]  
I was inviting (her into my heart)  
But she was out riding (in some other man's car)  
She was my night time, (thought I was her star)  
Guess I was wrong, but, see, I'm strong  
Won't take me long for me to move on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Please, don't worry 'bout me, I'm fine  
(Please, don't worry 'bout me, I'm fine)  
Only gonna play the fool one time  
(Only gonna play the fool one time)  
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay  
Go on, girl  
(Go on, girl)  
Go on, girl  
(Go on, girl)  
Go on, girl  
  
I can't get it back  
But I don't want it back  
I realized that she  
Don't know how to act  
Tried to settle down and look what I get  
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet  
She at the bar getting drinks from many men  
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends  
Just not knowing, truly not knowing  
I look back now like, man, I was open  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooo, the mistake I made was clear  
(We never should've been together)  
That's the reason you're not here  
(I know that I can do much better)  
Not a single salty tear  
Not a feeling in my chest  
Baby, I'm feeling no stress  
I'm too fly to be depressed  
  
Go on, girl, go on, girl  
Go on, girl, go on, girl  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Go on, girl, go on, girl, go on, girl  
I'll be fine
