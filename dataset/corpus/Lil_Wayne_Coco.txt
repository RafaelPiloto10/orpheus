[Intro]  
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait  
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape  
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape  
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil' homie gon' be straight  
  
[Hook]  
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
And I'm sorry for the wait too  
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Fuck, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table  
  
[Verse 1]  
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who  
Who was there when niggas left? Nigga, me, that's who  
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army  
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony  
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money  
Ain't gotta hold no conversation or my luggage  
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred  
Birdman Jr., more like Ugly Duckling  
  
[Bridge]  
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Think it's over? Bitch I'm thinkin' forward  
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga  
All I got is Young Money, no more Cash, nigga  
  
[Hook]  
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
No longer am I my brother's keeper, Cain and Abel  
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth  
Tell them niggas no love lost cause I ain't got shit to lose  
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
I found a needle in a haystack, put the thread through  
I tried to stitch the wound back up but I just bled through  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's compensation over conversation  
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces  
Lord, this game is a vampire  
But you gotta protect your neck, it'll suck you dry like raisins, lord  
But fuck that, nigga  
Gun drawn out, fuck that, nigga, I'ma ball out  
The day you met me is when Hell froze  
On the day I left is when it thawed out  
I'm still in the buildin', I just have to knock a couple walls down  
Have to kick y'all out  
Life is a movie but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin' and walk out  
  
[Bridge]  
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over  
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga  
And all I do is smoke, fuckin' thrash, nigga  
  
[Hook]  
And this the Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table  
Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you  
You've been down since day 1, it meant nothin' on take 2  
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow and to say too  
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school  
  
[Outro]  
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over  
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over  
If so then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
