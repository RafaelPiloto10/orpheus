Nauseous, raising the stakes  
Increasing the weight  
Got homies I can lay down  
And lift their plate  
So quit trying to invade my space  
Before I call for a face to face  
And gotta rest my case  
  
This is how we do it  
Just recognise  
We can get you right to it  
Look into these eyes  
Look into these eyes  
And you'll see the size of the fame  
Then you might despise  
The size of my game  
Step the fuck back  
Xzibit's on the track  
You shoulda buckled up  
Before your head hit the dash  
You gotta hate that  
A demo from an eight track  
Brought me to a place  
Where platinum comes in eight stack, bitch
