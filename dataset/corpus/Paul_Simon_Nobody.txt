Who knows my secret broken bone  
Who feels my flesh when I am gone  
Who was a witness to the dream  
Who kissed my eyes and saw the scream  
Lying there  
Nobody  
  
Who is my reason to begin  
Who plows the earth, who breaks the skin  
Who took my two hands and made them four  
Who is my heart, who is my door  
Nobody  
  
Nobody but you, girl  
Nobody but you  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody  
  
Who makes the bed that can't be made  
Who is my mirror, who is my blade  
When I am rising like a flood  
Who feels the pounding in my blood  
Oh, nobody  
  
Nobody but you  
Nobody but you, girl  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody, girl  
Oh, oh, nobody  
  
Oh, no-no-no, nobody but you, yeah  
Nobody but you  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody, nobody
