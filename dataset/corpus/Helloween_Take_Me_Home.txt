Now I'm here all alone  
Takin' care of my own  
Down in no man's land  
Got no friend, got no dime  
Only plenty of time  
Where's the saving hand?  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home  
  
It's not true - what you see  
Behind that mask that's not me  
Try to reach my world  
Can't you see I'm so blind  
Stay with me to change my mind  
No more nightmares, girl  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home  
  
[SOLO]  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home
