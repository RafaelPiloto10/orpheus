At least an hour  
And let you dangle in my arms  
Cause love is power  
Can you feel it sky's the limit  
Once you reveal it  
Yout heart was wounded  
God sent me to heal it  
On a mission aint no stress love

Trow this rock up on your hand

This is how we'll start love anew  
This time it's gonna last forever

We're going from Tahiti to France  
To Italy in one night  
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight  
And you can drive it laced in all white  
I'm wearing triple black  
Our gear is top flight  
Trips to Venice  
The man of steel when I'm in this  
A mach made in heaven  
When we blend this  
Lovers everlasting  
In other words endless  
Hey yo face  
What's up on the real  
Was the honey lookin laced  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ladies and gentlemen Howard Hewett  
[bridge Hewett]  
See I never met a girl no, no  
Who satisfied my mental and physical thing  
When I lay down to sleep and I rest assured  
With the thought that you are right  
Right next to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You know what I'm saying baby  
Word is bond

No doubt about it you know what I mean  
Uh lookin hot girl  
Yeah I'm feelin you boo  
You know what I'm sayin I swear  
There's a lot of things I what to do to you  
But first ya gotta take tis ring  
Drop it  
  
So much love between us  
I'll be the one to come running  
Be the one to come running  
I'll come running home to you now,  
Home to you baby  
With a woman like you  
I don't need to play around  
Oh, your more then just one woman  
You blowin my mind with the love  
That you givin

Girl everyday  
  
[Chorus:]
