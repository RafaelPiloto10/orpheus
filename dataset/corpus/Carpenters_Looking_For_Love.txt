Always have said there is a thing called love  
And in my life, I said the word a thousand times  
Looking around I can see lovers, lost in a world that's all their own  
Though people say love is everywhere,  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there  
  
I live my live growing from day to day  
Hoping I'll fined someone who cares  
Though people say love is everywhere,  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there
