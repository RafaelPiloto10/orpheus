Once a year we celebrate  
With stupid hats and plastic plates  
The fact that you were able to make  
Another trip around the sun  
  
And the whole clan gathers round  
And gifts and laughter do abound  
And we let out a joyful sound  
And sing that stupid song  
  
Happy birthday!  
Now you're one year older!  
Happy birthday!  
Your life still isn't over!  
Happy birthday!  
You did not accomplish much  
But you didn't die this year  
I guess that's good enough  
  
So let's drink to your fading health  
And hope you don't remind yourself  
The chance of finding fame and wealth  
Decrease with every year  
  
Does it feel like you're doing laps  
And eating food and taking naps  
And hoping that someday perhaps  
Your life will hold some cheer  
  
Happy birthday!  
What have you done that matters?  
Happy birthday!  
You're starting to get fatter  
Happy birthday!  
It's downhill from now on  
Try not to remind yourself  
Your best years are all gone  
  
If cryogenics were all free  
Then you could live like Walt Disney  
And live for all eternity  
Inside a block of ice  
  
But instead your time is set  
This is the only life you get  
And though it hasn't ended yet  
Sometimes you wish it might  
  
Happy birthday!  
You wish you had more money  
Happy birthday!  
Your life's so sad it's funny  
Happy birthday!  
How much more can you take?  
But your friends are hungry  
So just cut the stupid cake  
  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday, dear...
