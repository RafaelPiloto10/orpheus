Treat me sweet and gentle when you say, 'Goodnight'  
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me  
I get sentimental when you hold me tight  
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me  
  
Missing you since you went away  
Singin' the blues away each day  
Counting the nights and waiting for you  
  
I'm in the mood to let you know  
I never knew I loved you so  
Please say, you love me too  
  
When I get this feeling I'm in ecstasy  
So squeeze me but please, don't tease me  
Yes, squeeze me, mama, don't tease me, no, no  
Oh, squeeze me, mama, please don't tease me  
  
When I get this feeling I'm in ecstasy  
So squeeze me, mama, please don't tease me
