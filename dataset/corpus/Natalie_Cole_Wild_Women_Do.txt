You tell me you want a woman who's  
As simple as a flower.  
Well if you want me to act like that,  
You'd better pay me by the hour.  
  
Don't want to travel in the danger zone  
Take another number  
Don't want a lover who can hold her own  
Baby step aside if you don't want to ride  
Because  
  
[Chorus]  
Wild women do  
And they don't regret it  
Wild women show  
What they're goin' through  
Wild women do  
What you think they'll never  
What you only dream about  
Wild women do.  
  
You think that love is a vision of  
A princess in a picture  
Well let me tell you something, little boy  
You wouldn't know love if it hit ya  
  
Scared of someone who is off the wall  
Kickin' and a screamin'  
Don't you want a lover who can do it all?  
Listen to me Jack  
I ain't holdin' back  
'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on and wild with me baby.  
Everybody come on,  
Everybody get wild.  
  
[Chorus]
