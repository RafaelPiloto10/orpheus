The time is now or never  
The crashing is coming near  
The delphi is on the corner  
And he whispers in your ear  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more  
Now all you hear is crying  
Cause no one's on the phone  
Your feet are just now freezing over  
You know that you are here all alone  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more  
When I think of friends and places  
Things we wanted, hoped we'd be  
All that's left is fading traces  
Memories of what use to be  
Hear their laughter, see their shadows  
Feel the darkness, see the light  
We had lit all but lost so quickly  
We think we won but we lost the fight  
But it's all the same to me  
I've seen all I want to see  
First they laugh at you  
Then they cry  
Say they'll always be there  
Then they die  
So alone yet so alive  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more
