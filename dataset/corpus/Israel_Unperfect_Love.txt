(feat. Slim )  
  
Baby You Know I'm Feeling You  
And You Say You Feel Me Too  
But I Don't Know What We Should Do  
'cus I'm So Crazy Over You  
  
We Try To Find Ourselves Through All  
The Drama In Our Lives  
We Ain't Worth It But  
It's Okay Because  
We'll Work It Out  
  
From The Moment That I Saw You Babe  
Thought That We Could Be So Good  
The Situations Got My Time Of Day  
Find It Hard To Make It Through  
  
I Know We Have A [?]  
'cus When Things Go Wrong  
But No Matter What We Go  
[?] Carry On  
Sometimes I Wanna Let Go  
But Then I Keep Holding On  
So What We Gonna Do Baby  
With This Unperfect Love
