Will you ever say what I fear you're dying to say  
Well, I don't mind, if I don't think about it  
Another sleepless night reading over by the only light  
But I don't mind if I don't think about it  
What scares me most,  
I'll keep from you,  
If you want me to I'll keep from you  
  
Does it makes sense to you, getting old, living life 22  
Well, I don't mind, if I don't think about it  
Let's go far away,  
Let's leave today,  
If you want us to we'll leave today  
Will you ever say?
