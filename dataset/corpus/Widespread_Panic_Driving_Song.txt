The leaves seen through my window pane  
Remind me that it's time to move my life again  
November sun is felt by none  
A chilly breeze has blown my thoughts to what's to come  
A cup of warm coffee, some vitamin see  
A bowl for the cat, a bowl for the dog, a bowl for me  
Choose my bluest tape and unlock my car  
An honest tune with a lingering lead has taken me this far  
  
On the edge of the porch in the warm evening night  
Throwing the bone for the dog I see two passing lights  
Well, I wonder where that driver's bound  
Is there someone, somewhere, someway out there that I've not found  
A touch of smoke ain't what it seems  
Dust and sunshine can also make my eyes look mean  
But there's a brown cat sleeping through this day's show  
Toppin' off the woodpile, breathing slow
