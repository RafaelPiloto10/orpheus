Someone let communication out the door  
Someone decides it's worth fighting for  
Why haven't we learned by what we've done before  
Don't you know history's keeping score  
And just once more  
For every boy and every girl let there be love  
All over the world  
For everyone  
Under the sun  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
Let every voice be heard  
Le there be peace on earth  
Brother to brother  
'til it's felt around the world  
There's only one world in which we all mus live  
Heaven shoe us how to forgive  
And on that marble wall which holds a million names  
Generations of dreams gone down in flames  
Isn't, isn't it a shame  
For every boy and every girl  
Under the sun...  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
(why don't you try just a little harder)  
Let every voice be heard  
(my brother)  
Let there be peace on earth  
(oh, if we could just get it together)  
'til it's felt around the world...  
We're running out of time  
As our leaders roll the dice  
The human spirit cries  
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.  
(Chorus x2)  
Save the babies, save the babies  
If we only get it together  
If we could only get it together  
I think we could make it  
Think we could make it  
Save the children...  
Save the children...
