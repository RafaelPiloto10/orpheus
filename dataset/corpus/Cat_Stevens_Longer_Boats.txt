[Chorus]  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door.  
  
I don't want no god on my lawn  
Just a flower I can help along  
'Cause the soul of no body knows  
How a flower grows  
Oh how a flower grows.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary dropped her pants by the sand  
And let a parson come and take her hand  
But the soul of no body knows  
Where the parson goes, where does the parson go?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Addition verse performed in live version of this song.  
  
Raise your mind up and look around  
You can see them, yes they're looking down  
From a lonely asteroid, in a vacant void.  
Dyin', but not destroyed.
