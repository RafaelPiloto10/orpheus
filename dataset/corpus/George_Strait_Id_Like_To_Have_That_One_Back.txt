Heard somebody speak her name  
They said she was still looking fine  
I could feel that same old flame  
I once felt when she was mine  
Always thought that I was missing something  
But I found out much too late  
There'll never be another who loved me that way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd like to have that one back  
I've never known someone so true  
And a love that's pure and sweet  
Is what a man should never lose  
And if my lips had said I'm sorry  
She might have stopped right in her tracks  
Now I find my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back  
  
I can almost see her standing there  
Tears rolling down her face  
As she packed away her memories  
In that old worn out suit case  
If I'd only known then what I know now  
I'd never open that door  
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back  
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back
