I've been let down  
And I still comin' round  
I've been put down  
And I'm still comin' round for you  
Comin' round for you  
  
Take away everything that feels fine  
Catch a shape in the circles of my mind  
Make me feel like I belong to you  
Make me feel even if it ain't true  
  
Catch a train on a silver afternoon  
A thousand miles and I'm getting there too soon  
Take me there when I should be going home  
Tell me why I still feelin' all alone  
  
I've been let down  
And I'm still coming round  
I've been put down  
And I'm still comin' round for you  
Comin' round for you
