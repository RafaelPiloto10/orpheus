There once was a time when I was dead inside  
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born  
And prayed to the Devil to die  
Just when I thought the Devil had won  
Someone opened up the door  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
[Chorus]  
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I'm free  
Today I'm right where Mama  
Prayed I'd be  
I'm down on my knees  
Now I believe  
What Mama knew for sure  
He's King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
Now, if you're in trouble friend, let me tell you what to do  
I'll tell you what he's done for me  
And I know what he'll do for you  
It makes no difference what you've done  
You've a friend in the One that I adore  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
