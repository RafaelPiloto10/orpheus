All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
  
So I call, your name  
Cross my fingers, uncross the others  
Hesitate, oh I don't think straight  
With nothin' to prove  
  
I don't wanna say I'm leavin'  
I'll stay until the weekend  
You can take all the things, the boxes and rings  
And get goin'  
  
'Cause I've been waitin' for  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes  
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shakin' me down  
  
So I call (I call) you out (out baby)  
Just to feel a little bit better about myself (he does)  
I do (you do), baby  
I do, I do, I do  
  
Until their lips start to move  
And their friends talk music  
I'll say "I've never heard the tune."  
But I have, I just hate the band  
'Cause they remind me of you  
  
Every single night ends up the same  
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name  
(Over and over and over)  
I think it's striking me out  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes  
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down  
  
But not you,  
You still wear boots and your hair is too long  
And then this one, doesn't wanna admit she's fallin' in love  
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do  
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you ?  
  
Ha !  
  
I don't understand your reasons  
Please just stay over the weekend  
You can't take all those things  
They define you and me  
Everything we've become  
You're all that I need  
Please don't make me face my generation alone  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes  
And you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shakin' me down  
  
But not you,  
I feel your faith is destroying the world  
And then this one, never really understood  
The 80's is over and done  
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do,  
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you ?  
  
Say  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
