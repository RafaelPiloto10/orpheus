The way you looked at me tonight  
I've never seen that look  
In your eyes before  
But then again  
I don't think, I've ever looked  
Had the time to spare  
The will to share with you  
What have I missed?  
What have I done?  
I'm gonna turn back the tide  
Like it's just begun  
Time changes, time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all, we've been through  
Love don't come easy for me  
The way you looked into my eyes  
I could see the hurt  
I saw through your disguise  
Just give me time  
I can make it up to you  
Let me heal the pain  
I'm scared of losing you  
What have I missed?  
Where have I gone wrong?  
If I could turn back the time  
So, we've just begun  
Time changes  
Time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all, we've been through  
Love don't come easy for me  
For me  
What have I missed  
What have I done  
I'm gonna turn back the tide  
So we've just begun  
Time changes  
Time changes  
Time changes for the better  
After all, we've been through  
Love don't come easy for me  
Love don't come easy  
After all, we've been through  
Love don't come easy for me  
Love don't come easy
