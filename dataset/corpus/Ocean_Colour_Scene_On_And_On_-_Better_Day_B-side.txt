Even while I've got my word it goes on and on  
On and on, it goes on and on  
Seen my fortune and I lift my words and they are everything  
Oh oh, they are everything  
Sailing boats and open roads can seem to pass you by  
But sailing boats and open roads can pass you in disguise  
Seen my days and oh I swear they go on and on  
Oh oh, they go on and on  
Have??? And it seems to work and it says everything  
Oh oh, it goes on and on  
Repeat first verse
