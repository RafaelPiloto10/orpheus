I get rattled every time we meet  
I get rattled even in my sleep  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
I get twisted, I get turned around  
I get twisted, and Im up then Im down  
I get twisted, baby, over you  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted - shaken - rattled  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted - shaken - rattled  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
I get shaken, Im torn up by the roots  
Yeah, Im shakin, way down in my boots  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
Rattled, baby, over you
