Ah let me, let me  
Let me be your Sunday driver  
Let me be your Monday man  
I'll take you anywhere you want  
Just as fast as I can  
  
It doesn't matter what you want to do  
It doesn't matter where you want to go  
Just gotta decide girl and then you let me know  
  
Oh, did you ever want lovin', so you're callin'  
Up your baby and she's stallin' with the neighbors  
And the night keeps gettin' longer  
And the urge keeps getting stronger  
So you try him and your dyin' and you're wonderin' does she love you  
A knock comes at your door  
Let me in honey  
  
Let me  
Let me be your Tuesday taxi  
Let me be your Wednesday boy  
I'll be your lovin' man  
You'll be my bundle of joy  
  
And oh  
It doesn't matter what you want to do  
It doesn't matter where you want to go  
You just gotta decide girl and then you let me know
