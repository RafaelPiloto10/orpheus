You know as true as trees are tall  
And autumn leaves do fall  
Oh, it sometimes rains in paradise  
And even the warmest heart can turn to ice  
  
I know it happend to us all  
Every kind of people fall  
And after all the tears are gone  
Do we have the heart to carry on  
  
  
Chorus:  
Here and now, still somehow  
Still a friend of mine, oh you're still a friend of mine  
Still a friend of mine, you're still a friend of mine  
Still a friend of mine, oh you're still a friend of mine  
Oh  
  
To think of all the times I hurt you  
And never thought it through  
Oh, I treated you so badly baby  
Could such a cruel heart ever be free  
  
I know it happens to us all  
Every kind of people fall  
Oh, and after all is said and done  
Do we have the heart to carry on  
  
Chorus  
  
I know as long as I've got you  
And we do the things we do  
The next time baby  
That our love breaks down  
I'll do the best that I can  
To turn it around  
  
Chorus  
  
Time and time and time again  
I'm gonna be right here for you baby  
Seasons come and seasons go  
Gonna be right here for you  
  
Repeat x 3 (Fade)
