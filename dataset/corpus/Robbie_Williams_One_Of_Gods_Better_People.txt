You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special  
And I cry so I can talk like this  
From my downbeat existence  
And I know that you can make my wish  
If my wish is pure  
  
But I don't know  
I just don't know  
I don't know  
Let me love you so  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special  
It must hurt to see your favourite man  
Lose himself again and again  
And I know that you're my only friend  
From way back when  
  
My wish was pure  
It was oh so pure  
It was pure  
I couldn't love you more  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
'Cos I don't know no more  
I just don't know no more  
I jsut don't know  
Let me love you so  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special
