Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn - in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath  
Inferno - You're gonna crash and burn  
Inferno - You're gonna burn in hell  
Blood eyes in burning fury  
Flesh peeling from the bone  
The Gods are judge and jury  
Inferno is their home  
You cry - You die  
As you head for the grave  
Welcome to purgatory  
Your soul is fried  
Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn - in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath
