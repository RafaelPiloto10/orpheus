There I go, there I go, there I go  
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control  
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me  
I never can behave  
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic  
Music all around me, crazy music  
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you  
Turns me your slave  
Come and do with me any little thing you want to  
Anything baby, just let me get next to you  
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?  
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies  
How I worry about you  
Just can't live my life without you  
Baby come here, don't have no fear  
Oh, is there a wonder why  
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?  
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?  
So tell me why stop to think  
About this weather, my dear?  
This little dream might fade away  
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby  
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?  
That would make me strong and brave  
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid  
If there's a cloud up above us  
Go on and let it rain  
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane  
Oh my baby  
Won't you please let me love you  
And give a relief from this awful misery?  
Oh pretty baby, you make me feel so good  
Let me take you by the hand  
Come let us visit out there  
In that new promised land  
Maybe there we can find  
A good place to use a loving state of mind  
I'm so crazy daddy  
And I never knew what love's all about  
James Moody, you can come on in man  
And you can blow now if you want to  
We're through
