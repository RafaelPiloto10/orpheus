Dressed up to the nines  
Dancin' three-quarter time  
The champagne is on ice  
No one's gonna guess  
In your brand new dress  
Girl, you sure look nice  
  
Have a good time  
Honey, don't look back  
Stone in the middle of the aftermath  
  
Don't wink, don't blink  
Don't let 'em think  
His leavin's got you down  
Stand straight, hang tough  
When they bring it up  
Baby hold your ground  
  
If they pry, don't sigh  
Pass it off with a laugh  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
You can do it honey  
Keep that smile so sunny  
You can show them what they want to see  
Yes, you can  
  
It's a cold, hard scene  
The singles thing  
Losers everywhere  
And it hurts to the bone  
Headin' home alone  
When someone used to be there  
  
So you take a few falls  
And you learn to bounce back  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
Living through the aftermath  
Baby, don't look back  
It's the aftermath
