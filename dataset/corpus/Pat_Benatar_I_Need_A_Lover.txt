I need a lover that won't drive me crazy  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy  
Some girl that knows the meaning of, ah-  
Hey hit the highway!  
  
Well I've been walking the streets in the evenin'  
Racin' through the human jungle at night  
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent  
Hey - I'm so weak, won't somebody shut off that light?  
  
Electricity runs through the video  
And I watch it from this hole I call home  
And all them stonies are dancin' to the radio  
And I got the world callin' me up free tonight on the phone  
  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
Some girl who'll thrill me and then go away  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah-  
Hey hit the highway!  
  
Well I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm livin'  
I'm gonna quit this job, and go to school, and head back home  
(head back home)  
Now I'm not asking to be loved or be forgiven  
Hey - I just can't face shakin' in this bedroom  
One more night alone  
  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah-  
Hey hit the highway!  
  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
Some girl to thrill me and then go away  
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)  
Some girl that knows the meaning of ah-  
Hey hit the highway!  
  
You betcha'
