I have told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home.  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
I can't find anythin to be sad about.  
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine.  
I have tried  
So very hard as hell  
To stay away from them  
And go upstairs.  
When I see  
All of your remedies  
I try more desperately to go home.  
I can't find anythin to be sad about.  
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine.  
But if I'm seatin here lonely,  
With no one to hold me,  
At least i'll have my health.  
I'm tryin to control myself.  
I hav told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home.  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
I've been acting irresponsibly  
Oh what could possibly go wrong.  
I have choked on all your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
But if I'm seatin here lonely,  
With no one to hold me,  
At least i'll have my health.  
I'm tryin to control myself.
