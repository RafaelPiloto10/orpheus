Baby, take me down to Duke's place  
Wildest box in town is Duke's place  
Love that piano sound in Duke's place  
Saxes do their tricks in Duke's place  
  
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's place  
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's place  
You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat  
You look around and yell waiter  
  
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up  
You're jetting along with your girlie  
It's after three o'clock, but, baby, it's still early  
If you've never been to Duke's place  
Take your tootsies into Duke's place  
Life is in a spin in Duke's place
