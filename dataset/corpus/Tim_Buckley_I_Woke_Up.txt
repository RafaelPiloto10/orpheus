Now the sun sits on my hand  
O where are you ?  
Walking the wind I fly above the shore of the town  
To the hills where I can hear  
The harbor bells ring slavery  
Where the fortune teller sighs to me  
O I see your woman in the raw  
Ride a mare of stone and howl  
  
I woke up  
While morning built  
The world with light,  
Crossing their hearts,  
Twelve sailor boys all stood in a ring  
Round our bed,  
And from the grass a dancer rose,  
Shivering,  
Oh the sailors pointing  
Out to sea  
And the dancer diving  
Up the sky  
'Til we forgot the day
