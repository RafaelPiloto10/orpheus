Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too  
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways  
I say trust Him at once which is something these days  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Did the world just explode?  
Don't recognize anyone  
But you've still got me under your thumb  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy  
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy  
You live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Well I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
But you can't buy me off in this serial world  
Who who who died and made you material girl?  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong  
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality  
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you  
Live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Still I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
