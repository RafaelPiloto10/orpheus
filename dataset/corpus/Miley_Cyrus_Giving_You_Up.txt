What...  
Could you hope to achieve,  
When I'm cryin' and you know why?  
How...  
Do you find your reasons,  
In my deepest, darkest night?  
I keep givin' you up.  
  
I remember when,  
You were my only friend.  
Now I'm not sure you can,  
Feel like that again.  
I keep givin' you up.  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
All the things that you said,  
Well you seem to forget.  
They surround in my head,  
Every night.  
And there's a battle within,  
That I'll never win.  
'Cause it's me,  
That I'm up against.  
'Cause it's my heart,  
Versus common sense.  
Can I give you up?  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find,  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
Strip the layers,  
Make me better,  
Help me get out clean,  
Show your colors.  
I'm slipping under.  
Help me through this,  
Pleaseee!  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find,  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
Yeahhhhh!  
My mind's made up!  
Yeahhhhhh  
I'm giving you up,  
I'm giving you up,  
I'm giving you up.
