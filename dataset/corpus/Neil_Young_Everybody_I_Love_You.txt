Know you got to run,  
Know you got to hide  
Still there is a great life  
Lingerin' deep within your eyes.  
  
Open up, open up, baby let me in.  
  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself, my friend.  
  
Everybody, I love you  
Everybody, I do  
  
Though your heart is in anger  
I need your love to get through  
When I tell you I love you  
You can believe that it's true  
  
Everybody, I love you  
Everybody, I do.
