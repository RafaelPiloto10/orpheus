It's hard to believe that you could ever doubt me  
I try not to hear the things you say about me  
And if you feel like I feel, please, I'd like to explain  
My love for you is more than just a game  
  
I hope and I pray we'll get together someday  
Then you'd see right away how hurt I am when I say  
That if you feel what I feel, you won't go away  
A broken heart can't be the only way  
  
And if you feel what I feel, you won't go away  
A broken heart, a broken heart, can't be the only way  
  
Now you must believe that when I saw you today  
Oh, I just couldn't say, you held his hand the same way  
If you don't feel what I feel, I'll go on my way  
But as I turn my heart still wants to say  
  
I love you, I need you, I do love you
