Piece by piece you're tearin' me apart  
Give to me and try another start  
Brick by brick you really love this game  
Things from which I can't refrain  
  
So many stories have been told  
I give a damn, they're much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams?  
When will I see it all come true?  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it bein' nice as it seems?  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi  
  
Ding by ding can you dig my dong  
It may come short but it might come long  
Limb by limb you're climbing on my tree  
Making things more fun for me  
  
So many stories I've been told  
I give a damn, they're much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams?  
When will I see it all come true?  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it being nice as it seems?  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi  
  
[SOLO]  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
