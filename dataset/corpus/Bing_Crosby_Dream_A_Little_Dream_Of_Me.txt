Ohhh  
Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you  
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say night-ie night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear  
Still cravin' your ki-iss  
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear  
Just sayin' this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Yeah-eah Bob, you ain't just dreamin'  
You is awake  
Mm  
  
Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear  
Still cravin' your ki-iss  
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear  
All I keep sayin' is this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Drea-eam a little drea-eam of me
