For 13 days... we have trained and trained  
We're learning to walk again, we're learning to stretch our skin  
  
Every time THEY bring us back to life  
Little jars come down from the shelves  
Every time we feel the sting  
Every time we feel the Blood going in  
  
Our eyes are now our minds  
Our Souls.. are in our magical skin  
The Blood THEY use must come from our own  
Living just an hour, then we fade again  
  
"In the Darkness we live our lives"  
In the dark we die again  
"In the Darkness we live our lives"  
In the dark we die and die and die again  
  
Darkness...Darkness  
  
Every night Victoria and I  
We spend what's left of the Blood in our systems  
Sitting on opposite shelves  
Talking with our eyes, trying to remember  
It is all that we've got  
  
Our eyes are now our minds  
Our Souls.. are in our magical skin  
We're living through our memories  
And it's worth it...  
  
"In the Darkness we live our lives"  
In the dark we die again  
"In the Darkness we live our lives"  
In the dark we die and die and die again  
  
Darkness...Darkness  
The Puppet Master is hear again  
  
"Tonight you will dance for me Puppet Girl  
Tonight.. no strings attached"  
  
"But I can't, never did I dance, oh I don't have a chance"  
  
"Dance"  
  
"I take a step, oh I try my best  
I stumble into the shelves with all the jars"  
6...6 of them coming down  
Broken glass and Puppet life is on the floor  
  
"In the Darkness we live out lives"  
"Send her far away, far away from here"  
"In the Darkness we live our lives"  
"To the other theater.. tomorrow morning she must be gone  
Send her to Berlin...send that Puppet to Berlin"
