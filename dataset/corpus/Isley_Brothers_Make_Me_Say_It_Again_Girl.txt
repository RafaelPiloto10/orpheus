Oh, I believe you are an angel  
All the heaven I need to see  
You're the promise everlasting  
Where you are, I hope to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Make me say it again girl  
Make me say it again girl  
Make me say it again girl  
You're all I need, oh yes you are  
You're all I need, oh yes you are  
You're all I need  
  
Whatever pains inside, you make it better  
You seem to realize, when I'm concerned  
You are the only one who goes through the changes  
Giving my life directions, when I am turned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How am I worthy of love from an angel  
Princess Imperial of my soul  
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer  
Hoping what I reveal you already know  
  
[Chorus]
