It's too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Don't let's talk or even walk  
If you want to make love, okay  
  
It's too hot for words  
There's nothing like relaxation  
Can't ignore this temperature  
But if you want to make love, okay  
  
Let's find a cozy nook  
Beside a babbling brook  
Let's find a shady tree  
Let the love birds talk for you and me  
  
Cause it's much too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Goodness knows my heart disclose  
All it dares to say  
All it cares to say  
It's too hot for words
