Between the eyes of love I call your name  
Behind those guarded walls I used to go  
Upon a summer wind there's a certain melody  
Takes me back to the place that I know  
Down on the beach  
  
The secrets of the summer I will keep  
The sands of time will blow a mystery  
No-one but you and I  
Underneath that moonlit sky  
Take me back to the place that I know  
On the beach  
  
Forever in my dreams my heart will be  
Hanging on to this sweet memory  
A day of strange desire  
And a night that burned like fire  
Take me back to the place that I know  
On the beach
