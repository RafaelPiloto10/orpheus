I always  
Stayed away from love  
Afraid of what might  
Might happen  
Till I thought  
I heard a sound above  
Singing through my very  
Own heart  
Was a melody  
I never heard  
Like birds singing loud  
To the sky  
  
Never dreamed that  
True love would help me  
Find my way  
Didn't know how deep I'd fallen  
Until you rescued, rescued me  
Suddenly  
Strings began  
I heard the melody again and again  
The sound of music  
Flowing through my head  
So rare  
I'm walking on air  
  
Melody of love  
Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away  
  
One lonely night  
You up and dance into my dreams  
Baby you set my heart on fire  
So I've been burning  
Burning ever since yeah  
Suddenly  
Strings began  
I hear the melody again and again  
The sounds of trumpets  
Flowing through my head  
So rare I'm walking on air  
  
Melody of love  
Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away  
Melody of love  
Oh set me free yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away  
  
Oh melody  
Oh melody  
I can really feel it  
You can feel it, too  
Oh melody  
Oh melody  
  
Melody of love  
Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away  
Melody of love  
Oh set me free yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away
