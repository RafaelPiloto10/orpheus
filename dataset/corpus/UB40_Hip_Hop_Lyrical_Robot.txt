[Chorus]  
Can you dig it, alright I can dig it  
Cause I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat  
Yes I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat  
  
I want the girls to hear me rap  
Cause this mc has got the nack  
I'm your body-popping shell shocking  
Girls hocking eye popping lick me all over like a lollipop  
I'm your juicy fruit  
Alright, alright, alright  
  
I said hey white man, Indian or black  
I'm your number 1 M-C and that's a fact  
I'm a good locking, girl hooking outstanding  
Mile chatting lyrical shock attack  
All M-C's freeze there on the spot  
One false move and you must get drop  
I'm always devastating, fascinating  
Videmaking, pinstaking, watch it man I'm hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its a struggle in life when your skin is black  
The system is designed to hold you back  
how s'ya do shle hands on the shoulder a pat  
One love to my face then a stab in the back  
Seven points in snooker when you put down the black  
But I still thank God for the little I got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't stop rapping to the musical beat  
And I'm in the mood to turn you on  
In the groove that's so complete  
Wind you hips, shake your body  
Or clap you hands even stamp your feet  
Just like a bed that's just been spread  
You know I'm neat, neat, neat  
Just like a tap that's running hot  
Man can't you feel the heat  
Not just now but every minute every hour  
Everyday and every week  
  
I don't give a hoot for loot and shoot  
Or prostitutes in skin tight suits  
Standing on the corner  
They call their beat  
I'm not a pimp drug pusher  
Gambler or even thief  
To the teachers I will preach  
And to the teachers I will teach  
Cause I'm a hip hop lyrical robot  
That is why so unique  
Well police and thieves are playing  
The game of hide and seek  
When an informer gives information  
Then its called a leak  
I jail your a number ruled by governor  
Screws keep you under, want to see you blunder  
When they say "Sit" just take a seat  
And when they say "food" it's time to eat  
If a screw says "Nigger" I don't answer  
Yes sir, no sir three bags full sir  
Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler  
Me a growler, I'm no growler  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot  
I don't stop rapping to the musical beat  
  
Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot and a red cool cat
