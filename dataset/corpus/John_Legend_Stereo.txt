She's a fast love professional  
Crafty, bold and beautiful  
Stage right, locked eyes, I swear it's magical  
Her name is Melanie, says she digs my melody  
Likes how I move, thinks I'm cool, that's what she says to me  
Big stage, bright light, short love, long night  
Frequent flies through the skies to some stars  
I come back to town, she's hangin' around  
But still feels so real but it can't go too far  
  
Her favorite colors be platinum and gold!  
She only loves in stereo! she only loves in stereo!  
I should know 'cause I've seen it before  
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
  
Turn on the video, oh my goodness there she goes  
Now I'm hot, seems I'm not, the only one she knows  
Name dropping everyday, I still want her anyway...  
I like how she moves, think she's cool.. my favorite get away  
  
Big stage, bright light, short love, long night  
Deja vu yeh we'll do it again, off the next town  
She's onto the next round  
Let it go, we both know that its all gonna end oh  
  
Her favorite colors be platinum and gold!  
She only loves in stereo! she only loves in stereo!  
I should know cause I've seen it before  
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
  
She fell in love with the radio  
Wasn't really me, so I had to let her go  
Just ask any DJ back in her hotel  
She likes to get around  
As much as she gets down  
  
Her favorite colors be platinum and gold!  
She only loves in stereo! she only loves in stereo!  
I should know cause I've seen it before  
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
She loves in stereo  
Think I gotta let her  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
She loves in stereo  
Think I gotta let her  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
She loves in stereo  
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh...  
She loves in stereo  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!
