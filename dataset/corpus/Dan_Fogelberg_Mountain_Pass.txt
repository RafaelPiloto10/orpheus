Well, I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
This highway ain't the very best companion  
?Cause I know there's somewhere else I'd rather be  
  
The moonlight on the snow just sets me thinking  
?Bout the way your smile shines upon your face  
And I know this ain't the last beer I'll be drinking  
Before I reach my final resting place  
  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
  
Oh my wheels are running hard against this mountain  
I finally crossed the Archuleta line  
Another hour and I'll be with my darlin'  
To dry those lonesome tears that she's been cryin'  
  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
  
I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
Well this highway ain't the very best companion  
?Cause I know there's somewhere else I'd rather be  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
I am runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again
