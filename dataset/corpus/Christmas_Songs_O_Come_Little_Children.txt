O come, little children, O come one and all,  
To Bethlehem haste, to the manger so small,  
God's son for a gift has been sent you this night  
To be your redeemer, your joy and delight.  
  
He's born in a stable for you and for me,  
Draw near by the bright gleaming starlight to see,  
In swaddling clothes lying so meek and so mild,  
And purer than angels the heavenly Child.  
  
See Mary and Joseph, with love beaming eyes,  
Are gazing upon the rude bed where He lies,  
The shepherds are kneeling, with hearts full of love  
While angels sing loud hallelujahs above.  
  
Kneel down and adore Him with shepherds today,  
Lift up little hands now and praise Him as they  
Rejoice that a Saviour from sin you can boast,  
And join in the song of the heavenly host.
