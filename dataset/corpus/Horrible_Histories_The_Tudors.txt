[Intro]  
Anyone whose lived around these parts,  
Or ever knew'd us,  
Is well aware that you should never mess with the Tudors.  
  
[Verse 1]  
My Grandad Henry Seventh,  
He beat King Richard,  
That's him pictured,  
Defeating the Tyke.  
  
[Verse 2]  
He liked his name so much that,  
To keep alive is memory,  
He called his own son Henry,  
What was he like!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Everyone said Hen-er-y the eighth was a baddy,  
I have to agree,  
Even though he was my daddy.  
(Just popping of to chop some wives.)  
  
[Chorus]  
Cos we're Tudors,  
Britain's biggest feuders,  
And just like barracudas,  
We kill with methods foul.  
  
Tudors  
Each enemy a Judas,  
At least we're not as rude as,  
Simon Cowell.  
  
[Verse 4]  
My reign was quite notorious,  
I liked to hunt and slaughter,  
But then you had a daughter,  
Mary was her name,  
It was a son I wanted,  
So I divorced her mother,  
Then wife two had another,  
A girl? Not again!  
(That's me your talking about! )  
  
[Chorus]  
Tudor,  
Superior to you duh,  
Who followed me as ruler,  
Best not to ask.  
  
[Verse 5]  
It must have been my laddie,  
Yes sicky little Eddie,  
Was I'll and soon got deady  
And who came next?  
  
[Verse 6]  
Your daughters then took over,  
First came Bloody Mary,  
My sisters rule was scary,  
So all hail meeeeeee  
  
[Chorus]  
Tudors,  
The history books reviewed us,  
As nutters and big bruisers,  
Who kill and cull.  
  
[Outro]  
I never had an heir,  
So our reign ended there,  
We my not have been fair,  
But we were never dull
