Been here before a long time ago  
But this time I wear no sandals  
Ages past I gave all you people  
Food and water  
  
Three feet tall so very small I'm no trouble  
I bring thunder lightning sun and the rain  
For all the people in the land  
  
A message of love  
I bring you from up above  
All good children gather around  
Come join your hands and sing along  
  
They call me mad the swine  
I guess I'm mad the swine  
I've come to save you save you  
Mad the swine  
Mad the swine  
So all you people gather around  
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord  
  
I woke up on the water just as before  
I'll help the meek and the mild and believers and the blind  
And all the creatures great and small  
Let me take you to the river without a ford  
Oh and then one day you realise  
You're all the same we've been in life  
All I've come to say just like before  
  
They call me mad the swine  
I'm mad the swine  
I've come to save you save you  
Mad the swine  
Mad the swine  
So all you people gather around  
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord  
Ooh  
  
Oh now  
So all you people gather around  
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord  
Don't ever fail me  
  
Mad the swine  
Mad the swine  
I've come to save you save you  
Oh now  
Mad the swine  
Mad the swine  
So all you people gather around  
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord  
Hands and praise the Lord  
Praise the Lord  
I'll get down on my knees and praise the Lord
