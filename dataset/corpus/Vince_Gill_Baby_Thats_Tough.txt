I know I've said I've changed for you  
But I think I've changed my mind  
I can't be what you want me to  
And we're just wastin' time  
  
And I'm doing the best I can  
Remember I'm just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby that's tough, baby that's tough  
  
I'm doing the best I can  
Remember I'm just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby that's tough, baby that's tough  
  
Well, I'm doing the best I can  
Remember I'm just a man  
And my best thing good in love  
Baby that's tough, baby that's tough...
