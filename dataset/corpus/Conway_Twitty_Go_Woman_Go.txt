Go woman go go woman go  
There you stand to tellin' me you're gettin' tired of me  
You're sayin' that I've changed up not the way I used to be  
Well there's some things I wanna say I think you ought to know  
And then I think I'm gonna let you go woman go  
[ dobro ]  
I stood by and watched you as you tore my honor down  
I even bought the clothes you wore to go out on the town  
I thought you'd have your fling and settle down but now I know  
That all you ever wanted was to go woman go  
[ dobro ]  
Now there you stand to tellin' me you're walkin' out the door  
You're sayin' that you've had it that you can't stand me no more  
You're thinking that I'll take you back the way I did before  
But not this time I've set your free to go woman go  
Woman go woman go woman go woman go
