What good is a dream,  
A plan or a scheme,  
The rainbow that you pursue?  
Its everything, and its nothing  
Without someone to tell it to.  
  
How eager you are  
To get to that star,  
But after the journeys through,  
You're only a lonely dreamer  
Without someone to tell it to.  
  
There'll be blue days,  
Hard to get through days,  
Days when you'll just want to die.  
Soon you're older,  
And the worlds colder,  
When there's no shoulder to cry on.  
  
Castles in air  
Are empty and bare  
With no one to share the view.  
The moonlight is merely moonlight,  
There's no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to.  
  
The moonlight is merely moonlight,  
There's no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to.
