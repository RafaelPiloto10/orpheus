What's that playing on the radio, why do I start swaying to and fro  
I have never heard that song before, but if I don't hear it anymore  
It's still familiar to me, sends a thrill right through me  
Cause those chords remind me of the night that I first fell in love to  
  
Those magic changes my heart arranges  
A melody that's never the same, a melody that's calling your name  
It begs you please, come back to me  
Please, return to me, don't go away again, oh make them play again  
The music I wanna hear is once again, you whisper in my ear  
Oh my darling, aha  
  
I'll be waiting by the radio, you'll come back to me someday, I know  
Been so long since our last goodbye, but I'm singin' as I cry  
While the bass is sounding, while the drums are pounding  
Beatings of my broken heart will rise the first place of the charts  
  
Oh my heart arranges, oh those magic changes, oooh yeah
