I could write my name by the age of three  
And I don't need anyone to cut my meat for me  
I'm a big girl now, see my big girl shoes  
It'll take more than just a breeze to make me  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard  
Fall overboard just so you can catch me  
  
But as strong as I seem to think I am my distressing damsel,  
She comes out at night when the moon's filled up and your eyes are  
Bright, then I think I simply aught to  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard  
Fall overboard just so you can catch me  
You can catch me.  
  
I watch the ships go sailing by  
I play the girl will you play the guy  
And I never thought I'd be the type  
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall to fall  
  
[Chorus]  
To fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard  
Fall overboard just so you can catch me  
You can catch me, you can catch me, you can catch-  
  
I watch the ships go sailing by I be your girl will you be my guy  
And I never thought I'd be the type to fall, to fall  
  
To fall, to fall, to fall...  
  
[Chorus]  
To fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard  
Fall overboard just so you can catch me  
You can catch me, you can catch me
