Magic moments  
There're the things I will remember  
Where's the time we spent together laughing  
Then you walk into my dream dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free, smiling at me  
So long since I've had you near  
  
Now you've come back again  
Where the love never ends  
And you're right here  
When I think of you  
  
When I need you, I just close my eyes  
And you're here  
Right beside me when I'm lost in shadows  
Of the memories of you oh my dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free, smiling at me  
In your eyes I walk without fear  
We're together again  
Where the love never ends  
'Cause you're right here  
When I think of you  
  
Hold on just for a while  
Hold on hold on  
  
I try to forget the night that you left  
It's all so unreal, with you gone  
I can dream once again  
Where the love never ends  
'Cause you're right here  
When I think of you  
When I think of you  
When I think of you
