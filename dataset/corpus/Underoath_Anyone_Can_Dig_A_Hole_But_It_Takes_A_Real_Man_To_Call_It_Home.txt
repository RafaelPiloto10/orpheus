I'm no leader, I'm just a mess  
It's not the way it's supposed to be  
It's just the way that it is  
I'm afraid we are all victims here  
And the one whose in charge  
I've lead us all astray again  
  
Oh, how the plot thickens!  
Are we too far gone?  
  
We always assume the worst  
  
I'm afraid no ones listening anymore  
I'm freaking out  
I'm so sick  
I'm making me sick  
Don't look down  
  
The only thing in my way is myself  
I'm just thinking out loud  
How can I still be alive  
I should have been gone so long ago  
  
I can't get away from it all  
I messed up like I always do  
I gave you nothing  
I took you nowhere  
You're still listening  
  
The world around me  
Has taken a turn for the worst  
I'm left alone  
Climbing to the top  
Should I jump, should I stay  
Can I make another day  
  
I am the one who's wrong  
God forgive me
