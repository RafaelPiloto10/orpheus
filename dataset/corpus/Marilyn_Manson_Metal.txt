On we plow  
The big bully try to stick his finger in my chest  
Try to tell me, tell me he's the best  
But I don't really give a good goddamn cause  
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well  
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well  
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well  
I wanna grow up  
I wanna be a big rock and roll star  
I wanna grow up  
I wanna be  
So no one fucks with me  
I got the pencils in my pocket, try to put me down  
Wanna go out, gotta get out  
To the playground, gonna throw down at the playground  
I wanna go out  
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal  
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal  
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal  
Next motherfucker  
Pow pow pow, pow pow pow, pow pow pow, pow pow pow  
I wanna grow up  
I wanna be a big rock and roll star  
I wanna grow up  
I wanna be  
So no one fucks with me
