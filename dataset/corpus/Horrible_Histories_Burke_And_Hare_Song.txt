I'm Knox a famous surgeon  
And I earn my daily bread  
By studying cadavers  
Which are bodies not long dead  
One day two suave young gentlemen  
Appeared within my view  
I'm Mr Burke, I'm Mr Hare  
How do you do?  
These gents explained that their  
Acquaintance had just passed away  
It seemed the body'd only been  
A goner for a day  
Excuse the curious offer  
Said Hare or was it Burke?  
But would you care to slice this up  
To see how corpses work?  
Well it's always a palaver  
Getting hold of a cadaver  
So I said yes I'll ahve her  
Oh, it's a he!  
  
This body taught me much about  
What makes a person poorly  
Why some men live to 99  
And some die prematurely  
How these thing function perfectly  
And others won't repair  
How everything is, interlinked  
Oh what's that doing there?  
  
'Til one day there was nothing left  
And all my work was spent  
Then Burke and Hare turned up again  
My, how convenient!  
Another slab of fresh  
Human organs, bone and flesh  
Another gory sesh, excellent news  
(Laughs evilly)  
  
As time went on these kind men  
Brought me several guys and gals  
My lab was choca-block  
With all their freshly passed on pals  
I paid them lots of money  
Bodies came from everywhere  
You really are a busy Mr Burke  
And Mr Hare  
  
They seemed such cultured gentlemen  
I never did suspect  
That Burke and Hare were not so nice  
I really should have checked  
Then one day a policeman came  
Asked if I've seen a chap  
I hadn't, but days later  
His corpses turned up in my lap  
  
It seemed that these acquaintances  
Of Burke and Hare actually  
Were not their friends and  
Did not always die naturally  
Burke and Hare had murdered them  
It was plain to see  
Then brought the corpses to my lab  
And pocketed the fee  
  
The two men were arrested  
But one of them set free  
Poor Burke was hanged  
But happily his corpse was sent to me  
Oh bit wiffy!  
Still much to learn
