I got manicured fingers and toes  
I got 4 layers of pee-soaked clothes but I'm still condescending  
Your as and teeth permanent browned  
Your face is permanently frowned and I have everything I want  
Your life's gotta really suck  
You gotta hustle all day just to make the bucks  
To get high enough just to forget about what you've become  
You're the one who lives nowhere  
You think you're life's more than a game of suits and ladders  
When nothing really matters  
You're not just fluous, you're superfluous  
You don't actually do anything, a human redundancy  
  
40 year old Macallans, 40 Old English ounces  
Henry the IV double shot  
I just finished a bottle of Old Crow  
I just bought a case of Chateau Margaux, not the 95, the 96  
Your house is of corrections  
Your house is full of collections of crap you bought from selling others out  
You're the one who has nothing  
Your life is a game of unstable bladders, when nothing really matters  
You woke up today covered in droppings (stock or bird)  
When the bottom drops, my life won't change a bit but yours will turn to shit  
You are a superfluous man, I am a superfluous man  
You're quite a superfluous man, I am a superfluous man
