It isn't quite ready, it's almost 5:30  
Scholars and flunkees  
Faggots and junkies  
Incinerator in a blood red sky  
Kill the head and the body will die  
I can't tell you that I'm happy  
But I can tell you that my clothes are snappy  
It's time to draw the line  
Superman died tonight  
Ate a pound of Kryptonite  
Drank a quart of brotherly love  
Fell straight from the sky above  
And if there's a hell below  
Kenneth Ray ain't gonna go  
He lost his soul in the Korean War  
I lost my concentration when he opened the door  
It's time to draw the line
