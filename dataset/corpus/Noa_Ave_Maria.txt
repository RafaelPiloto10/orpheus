Ave Maria  
Where have you been hiding?  
Don' t you know we need you!  
Things are looking pretty bad down here.  
I know that there is beauty  
Gentleness, and laughter  
These are things you always stood for  
Help us find them too.  
  
Hey, there, Maria!  
Santa Maria... Maria.  
May I take a liberty  
And say that it' s a shame to me  
Not to live in harmony  
Were all just hoping  
Someone will step forward singing...  
Amen, Amen  
  
Ave Maria  
Where have you been hiding?  
Don' t you know we need you!  
Things are looking pretty bad down here.  
I know you hear the fighting  
See the torch we're lighting  
On our quest for peace and freedom  
Help us see this through  
  
Hey, there, Maria!  
Santa Maria... Maria.  
May I take a liberty  
And say that it' s a shame to me  
Not to live in harmony  
We're all just hoping  
Someone will step forward singing...  
Amen
