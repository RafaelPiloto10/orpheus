Fleeting breath, Frailest flesh  
I'm a casualty at best  
And so I sink into Your depth  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Could never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
The treachery of valleys deep  
Has only made me weak  
I clothe this flesh with holiness  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
And when I see Your face I'll know  
All the pain and tears will go  
To the bottom of the sea  
You'll forever be holy, holy  
Holy...[4x]  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
Holy...[8x]  
When all is fallen (You are life to me)  
When all is broken (You are life to me)  
When all is empty (You are life to me)  
Life to me, life to me  
Life to me...  
When I am fallen (You are life to me)  
When I am broken (You are life to me)  
When I am empty (You are life to me)  
Life to me, life to me  
Life to me...Life to me...
