I got the  
I got them love sick blues ya'll  
Man, I can't find my baby  
I think she took off with another man  
I been around the world looking twice  
  
You know I checked in New York City  
On the streets and on the subways  
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me  
I looked out in the Hamptons thought she'd be hangin' with them rich folks  
But no she wasn't anywhere hangin' on the east coast  
  
I wish my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I wish my baby come home  
I want my baby yeah my baby to come back home  
Man you know I love that girl  
  
I checked down to the Southern plains from Alabama to Georgia  
Honey if you hear this, please know I'm looking for ya  
I checked with all my rebel friends  
I've looked around for weeks  
And I swear until I find her I won't eat and I won't sleep  
  
I want my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I wish my baby yeah my baby would come back home  
  
I went from Albuquerque to Maine and didn't find a damn thing  
So I looked in California - up and down the coast  
I looked all over Hollywood - it wasn't even close  
Never found nothin'  
So, I came home, home to Detroit City  
And there she was sittin' on my porch - My baby looked so pretty  
  
Now my baby's back home  
Yea my baby came home  
Yea my baby's back home  
I'm so happy that my baby is finally home
