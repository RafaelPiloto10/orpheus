I kind of knew that she would be  
Waiting for me in her room  
With a sick smile she told me not to  
Be a fool  
Her eyes went hard, staring right into  
My brain  
But I convinced her that I was feeling  
Real fine  
  
Oh, I was lying... Seeing the look in  
Her eyes  
Clearing My mind was important  
  
She believed everything I said  
And then she asked me if I would help  
To bring her outside  
  
Oh, I was lucky... "let us stay for a  
While" she said  
"Bathing ourselves in the moonlight"  
  
So there she was, unprotected by  
"THEM"  
I grabbed her cane, and tore it out of  
Her hand  
"No way, You're not going to escape"  
  
"Now that I've got You. .. Here You will  
Pay for Your deeds  
Your sick mind has come to an end  
Now"  
  
"Stop it"  
  
Nowhere to hide, Grandma' had died  
Alone in the night  
And "THEY" were waiting for me  
Waiting inside  
Hoping that I would come back in  
But I just ran away  
Into the woods, as far as I could  
I saw "THEIR" eyes  
And then I fainted again, going insane  
Dreaming that I was one of "THEM"...  
  
I hear "THEIR" voices all the time
