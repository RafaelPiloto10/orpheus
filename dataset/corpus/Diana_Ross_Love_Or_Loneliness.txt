(r. parker, jr.)  
Had a nice time  
I enjoyed the picture show  
When you walked me to my door  
I knew I wanted more  
When I asked you in  
It was already getting late  
Though I knew better  
I didn't eaven hesitate  
I like the way you hold me  
And make me feel so good  
Though I say I wouldn't  
You kinda knew that I would  
It's been so long since I've  
Been with a man  
Better ask myself  
While I still can  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
And how about you  
Do you really want me  
Or am I just here  
To please your masculinity  
You don't see me emough  
To let me know you care  
You know the worst thing for a woman  
Is a sometime love affair  
Seems like every time  
I satisfy your needs  
You don't call me back  
For two or three weeks  
What am I gonna do  
I just can't fight  
The temptation of loving you  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
Sometimes it's hard  
To tel the difference  
I'm just not sure  
If it's worth it  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
'cause you never show up 'til midnight  
Then you go home early  
Now you know that ain't right  
I've got a question I wanna ask you  
Do you really love me or am I just a fool  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it
