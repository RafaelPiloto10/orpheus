Start making sense  
Of everything I've seen before, well, um  
Somewhere in my life  
Been paying the price  
But that ain't enough anymore, well  
Don't get me wrong now baby  
Don't get me wrong baby  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me  
I don't know if I'm coming or going, baby, well  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things you keep on doing  
Something's getting outta control  
  
Can't help myself  
To everything I'm looking for  
No, no, no  
Sometimes I can't explain  
Why I go insane  
It just isn't fun anymore, well  
Don't get me wrong now baby  
Don't get me wrong baby  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me  
I don't know if I'm coming or going, baby, well  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things you keep on doing  
Something's getting outta control  
  
Outta control  
  
Yeah  
  
Shame on you  
  
Don't get me wrong now baby  
Don't get me wrong baby  
  
Strange, strange, strange

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me  
I don't know if I'm coming or going, baby, well  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things you keep on doing (keep on doing)  
Something's getting outta  
Something's getting outta  
Something's getting outta control  
  
Outta control  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things you keep on doing  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me

Things that happen to me  
To me, to me
