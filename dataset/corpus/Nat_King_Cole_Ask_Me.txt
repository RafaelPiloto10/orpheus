Ask me if I love you  
Ask how much I care  
Count the stars above you  
The answer is there  
  
Ask how much I need you  
Darling, I'd reply  
Can you count the ripples  
In streams passing by  
  
Ask me if I'd miss you  
If our dreams fell through  
Would the summer roses  
Miss the morning dew  
  
Ask me if I'll love you  
When years have flown away  
Darling, I will love you  
Much more than today  
  
Ask me if I'll love you  
When years have flown away  
Darling, I will love you  
Much more than today
