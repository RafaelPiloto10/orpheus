Such a pretty face  
Radiant, I saw you across the room  
I knew I had to have you  
Thus started the chase  
I knew I would do anything to take your hand and make you mine  
But I learned long ago  
If you love someone you have to let it go  
Let it go, Let it go  
The hardest part of letting go is saying  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
  
Feathered away in a makeshift cell  
Beneath the venomous moonlight  
I unleash my plan to watch you fail  
The one I am so ?  
Go to sleep my love  
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips  
Sealed with a kiss  
  
I return to the masquerade ball  
And hear the news of your weeping  
Stone by stone imbued in the wall  
Forever left for safekeeping  
Go to sleep my love  
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips  
Sealed with a kiss  
  
But I learned long ago  
If you love someone you have to let it go  
Let it go, let it go  
The hardest part of letting go is saying  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
(Goodbye)  
(Let it go)
