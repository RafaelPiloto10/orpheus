All my bags are packed  
I'm ready to go  
I'm standin' here outside your door  
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
  
But the dawn is breakin'  
It's early morn'  
The taxi's waitin'  
He's blowin' his horn  
Already I'm so lonesome I could die  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
'Cos I'm leavin' on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh babe, I hate to go  
  
There's so many times  
I've let you down  
So many times I've played around  
But I tell you now they don't mean a thing  
  
Every place I go I'll think of you  
Every song I sing I'll sing for you  
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
'Cos I'm leavin' on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh babe, I hate to go  
  
Yes I'm leavin' on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh babe, I hate to go  
Yes I'm leavin' on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
I'm leaving  
Yes I'm leaving
