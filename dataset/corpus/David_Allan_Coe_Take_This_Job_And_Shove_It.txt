Take this job and shove it  
I ain't working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was working for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't working here no more.  
  
I been workin' in this factory  
For nigh on fifteen years  
All this time I watched my woman  
Drownin' in a sea of tears  
And I seen a lot of good folks die  
That had a lot of bills to pay  
I'd give the shirt right offa' my back  
If I had the nerve to say.  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin' for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more.  
  
That foreman, he's a regular dog  
The line boss, he's a fool.  
He's got a flattop haircut  
Man, he thinks he's cool  
One of these days I'm gonna' blow my top  
And that sucker, he's gonna' pay  
And I just can't seem to wait  
Till I get the nerve to say  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more.  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't working here no more  
My woman done left and  
Took all the reasons  
I was workin' for  
You better not try to stand in my way  
Cause I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
  
Take this job and shove it!
