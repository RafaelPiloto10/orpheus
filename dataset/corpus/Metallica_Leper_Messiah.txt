Spineless from the start, sucked into the part  
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown  
Please, please  
Spreading his disease, living by his story  
Knees, knees  
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory  
You will  
  
Time for lust, time for lies  
Time to kiss your life goodbye  
Send me money, send me green  
Heaven you will meet  
Make a contribution  
And you'll get a better seat  
Bow to leper messiah  
  
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix  
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain  
Chain, chain  
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamor  
Fame, fame  
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power  
We see  
  
Time for lust, time for lies  
Time to kiss your life goodbye  
Send me money, send me green  
Heaven you will meet  
Make a contribution  
And you'll get the better seat  
Bow to leper messiah  
  
Witchery, weakening  
Sees the sheep are gathering  
Set the trap, hypnotize  
Now you follow  
  
Time for lust, time for lies  
Time to kiss your life goodbye  
Send me money, send me green  
Heaven you will meet  
Make a contribution  
And you'll get the better seat  
  
Lie
