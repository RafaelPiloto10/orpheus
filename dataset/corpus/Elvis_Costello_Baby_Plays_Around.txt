It's not open to discussion anymore  
He's out again tonight and I'm alone once more  
He's all I have worth waiting for  
But baby plays around  
And so it seems I've always been the last to know  
To hold on to that girl, I had to let her go  
I wish to God I didn't love her so  
'Cos baby plays around  
  
I try to be strong hold on to my pride  
He doesn't even know it's wrong, how much  
I hurt inside  
And heaven knows I've tried  
But baby plays around. Just a plaything  
It's hard to reconcile the facts I'm facing  
  
It's not open to discussion anymore  
She walks those shiny streets  
I walk the worn out floor  
She's all I have worth living for  
Baby plays, baby plays around
