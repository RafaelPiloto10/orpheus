If we borrow words  
They'll have to be returned  
Keeping them would surely be remiss  
The stars have acquiesced  
By giving us this night  
Let's just kiss  
  
Intellect and thought  
Are good enough for some  
Why waste time with all there is to miss  
In our quiet space  
We'll babysit the moon  
Let's just kiss  
  
Nothing to erase  
As the hour slows  
Nothing to be judged or tried untrue  
Handed us a case  
What a case to close  
It could take all night before we do  
  
We won't have to try  
Somehow we'll just know  
A thousand years before us led to this  
When we're finally through  
We'll usher in the sun  
Let's just kiss
