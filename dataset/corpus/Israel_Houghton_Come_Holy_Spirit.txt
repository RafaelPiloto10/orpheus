C- Come holy spirit, oh how we need You  
Come holy spirit, we need You  
  
1- Come with grace and fire  
Mighty rushing wind  
Comforter and breath of heaven  
Fill my heart again..  
  
Chorus  
  
2- Come with heaven's power  
Let the rains descend  
Times of sweet refreshing seasons  
Fill my heart, fill my heart, fill my heart, fill my heart, fill my heart
again...  
  
Chorus  
  
B- I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Bless me now my Saviour  
I come to Thee  
  
I praise You... I praise You  
  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Praise the name of Jesus  
He's my rock, He's my fortress  
He's my deliverer  
In Him, will I trust  
Praise the name of Jesus  
  
I worship You (4x's)  
I give You praise  
For You are my righteousness  
I worship You almighty God  
There is none like You  
There is none like You  
There is none like You  
There is none like You...
