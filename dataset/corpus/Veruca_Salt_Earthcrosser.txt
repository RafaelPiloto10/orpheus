Sleep little flea  
  
Little boy ?me?  
  
A freak  
  
Am I clean?  
  
([background whisper] sleep)  
  
I feel like men  
  
(sleep little flea)  
  
I feel like boys  
  
(little boy me)  
  
I think I'm peeling  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Disconnected  
  
I am unattached  
  
Unmade bed makes me feel like a failure  
  
Bedroom eyes lead to blurry vision  
  
Blurry vision  
  
Oh...  
  
Oh...  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Too pale, too sick  
  
Too scrawny  
  
But I'll sleep here anyway  
  
And the sheets smell like bodies  
  
Not mine  
  
Not yours  
  
Not yours...  
  
It's 2 am  
  
And it's quiet again  
  
Where's my lip gloss?  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd
