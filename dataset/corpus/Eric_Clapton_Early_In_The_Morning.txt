When a girl reach the age of 18  
She begins to think she's grown,  
And that's the kind of little girl  
You can never find at home.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come and see me early in the morning,  
Just about the break of day.  
Want to see me hug my pillow  
Where my baby used to lay?  
  
One drink of wine,  
Two drinks of gin.  
Pretty young got me  
In the shape I'm in.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pass by the juke joint,  
Look through the door.  
She's doing the boogie-woogie  
In the middle of the floor.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When a girl reach the age of 18  
She begins to think she's grown,  
And that's the kind of little girl  
You can never find at home.  
  
[Chorus]
