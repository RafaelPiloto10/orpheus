We shared a life, we shared a heart  
But what we united seems to be breaking apart  
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core  
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours  
  
I'll keep the same old things I had when we met  
And you'll keep what's yours ?cause that would only be fair  
But what about the heart that we both created together?  
  
[Chorus]  
We used to be the toast of the town  
We used to have the best love of all  
We had blue skies but they came falling down  
What happened to us  
  
You and I once were lovers  
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong  
So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong  
But I know with time things that start to mend  
  
So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again  
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been  
don't worry, I will start all over and then  
We will get back the heart that we both created together  
  
[CHORUS]  
  
Last night I cried but girl you were not here  
So it was just a big waste of tears  
But then I smiled, I heard your voice in my ear  
Tellin' me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning  
  
[Chorus]
