So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didn't really mean  
I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
You had your red flags up and raised  
More traffic than east L.A  
But I drove in anyway  
My common sense on holiday  
  
People fall out of phase  
We were a crashed cause  
We were just, be a place, stuck on your passport  
You travel to some time  
But I hope you'll find  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
You stay in love like vacation homes  
You like summer on the sunny coast  
But when the cold need a winter coat  
You say you will until you don't  
You wore a comb fist around your neck  
A different north in the ever end  
What did you get where you going yet  
We're sure the worst, we're sure the best  
  
I don't know how I fell into your rear view  
Paralyzed, alibi, I couldn't hear you  
So I hope you were right  
And I see you tonight  
With  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didn't really mean  
I'm sorry I'm not sorry
