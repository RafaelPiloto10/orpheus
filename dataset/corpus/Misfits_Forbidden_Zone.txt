Some say that's where man began  
On this wasted piece of land  
Where evolution's yet to show  
Forbidden Zone  
  
Blasting into outer space  
The planet of the apes  
Evolutions's one hero  
  
Crossing a plain into another dimension  
A million years into the future  
Crossing a path into another dimension  
We the unseen  
  
Back on earth it's all you'll read about  
All the evidence destroyed  
Maps and legends mark the firewalls  
We the lost abandoned saviors  
of the forbidden zone  
  
We shall sustain the forbidden zone
