Who would've thought of it  
That I might feel like this  
Some kind of wonderful  
There's nothing quite comparable  
  
The thing about it is  
It's oh so innocent  
I wasn't looking for  
It came knockin' at my door  
  
I'm trying to do things right  
But I'm about to lose this fight  
'Cause spending time with you  
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth  
  
And every day with you  
I swear it brings me closer  
To my only reservation is you  
My sweet temptation, baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, my heart is calling  
I'm falling for you  
Oh, my heart is calling  
I'm falling for you  
  
Who could imagine it  
I found my happiness  
In someone I barely know  
And I like to take it slow  
  
But you're so different, boy  
You're breaking all my rules  
What is it in your smile  
That makes me feel the way I do  
  
I'm trying to live my life  
And I'm trying to live it right  
If I desire you  
It ain't because I'm trying to  
  
Boy, everyday with you  
I swear it brings me closer to  
My only reservation is you,  
My sweet temptation, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've given it consideration (uh huh)  
And it all adds up to you  
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby  
I've given it a lot of thought (uh huh)  
And it all ends up on you  
My sweet temptation  
God knows I'm falling for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is is in your smile, boy  
Is it touch, baby  
I don't know why...
