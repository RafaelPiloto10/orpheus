When the colour of the night  
And all the smoke for one life  
Gives way to shaky movements,  
Improvisational skills,  
A forest of whispering speakers  
Let's swear that we will  
Get with the times,  
In a current health to stay  
Let's get friendship right  
Get life day-to-day  
In the forget-yer-skates dream  
Full of countervailing woes  
In diverse-as-ever scenes  
Proceeding on a need-to-know  
In a face so full of meaning  
As to almost make it glow  
  
O' for a good life, we just might have to weaken  
  
And find somewhere to go  
Go somewhere we're needed  
Find somewhere to grow  
Grow somewhere were needed.

We grow where we are needed.
