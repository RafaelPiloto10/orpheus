New power  
Let down your funky...  
Get off  
Get off baby  
  
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off  
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut 'til it coughs  
Get off, get off  
  
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip  
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship  
Get off, get off (get off baby)  
  
I will still be hip, when the words from your lip  
take a dip in the ratings  
And I'll be stripping your Mercedes of your lubricated lady  
And taking her for a walk, taking her for a walk  
  
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip  
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship  
Get off, get off  
Get off, get off  
  
Uh, is this a dream? No  
Everybody get off  
Is this a dream?  
Is this a dream?  
Get-o-get-o-get-o-get off  
  
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip  
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship  
Get off, get off (I got the best of you)  
Get off (hey, hey sugar)  
Get off  
  
Once I give her back to ya,  
She won't ever want to do ya  
'Cause I wrote the book  
I taught her how to look  
She showed me the money you gave her, I took  
I even ate her cooking, that's more than you did  
  
Get off, get off  
  
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off  
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut 'til it coughs  
Get off (uh, help me)  
Get off  
  
Get, get, get off  
New, new, new Power [Repeat until fade]
