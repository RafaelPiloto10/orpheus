Watchin' television one afternoon  
Lookin' for a movie or a good cartoon  
Stopped by a station's commercial break  
When suddenly I'm faced with a heartache  
The woman of my dreams is plain in view  
Sellin' me a can of liver stew  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
Now I watch TV 20 hours a day  
Just to watch your commercials play  
If someday your love was in reach  
I'd be all yours honey, you could put me on a leash  
You love that dog, could you love a man?  
I make my own gravy when you show that can  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
I figure the only way she'll notice me  
Is if I buy what she's sellin' on TV  
So I stop at the local shopping mall  
Head to the pet store and buy it all  
Go to the bank and empty my savings  
So I can buy more of what Spot is craving  
  
Spent all my money by accident  
Can't buy groceries or pay the rent  
Got evicted now I live on the street  
Crunchy kibble's all I got to eat  
My breath is real bad, my tongue's turning black  
But I've got a nice shiny coat of hair on my back  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
(Dogs barking and howling)  
Yeah, take it for a walk!  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl
