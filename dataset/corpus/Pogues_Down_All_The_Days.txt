Christy Brown  
A clown around town  
Now man of renown  
From Dingle to Down  
I can type with me toes  
Suck stout through me nose  
And where it's gonna end  
God only knows  
Down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
I have often had to depend upon  
The kindness of strangers  
But I've never been asked and I never replied  
If I supported the Glasgow Rangers  
And down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
Down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
And down all the days
