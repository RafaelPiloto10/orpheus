I know, what I know, I know  
On the car ride down  
I hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing I ever--  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
That girl you found  
Keeps that kind of window closed  
She'll turn into  
The only thing you ever--  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
Can't say why I kept this from you  
My those quiet eyes become you  
Leave it where it can't remind us  
Turn this all around behind us  
Oh! Well I know!  
I'll fall right in to keep you out  
I'd like to tell you all about it  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
This last time around  
I'll hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing you ever know  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
Ah yes.
