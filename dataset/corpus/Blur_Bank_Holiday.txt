Grandma has got new dentures  
To eat the crust on pizza  
Been taken out by her daughter  
Because she thought she ought'a  
The kids are eating snickers  
Because they're so delicious  
Then there's sticky fingers  
And mother looses her knickers  
  
[Chorus]  
Bank holiday comes six times a year  
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers  
Bank holiday comes with a six package beer  
Then its back to work a.g.a.i.n.  
  
Bar-b-que is cooking  
Sausages and chicken  
The patio is buzzing  
The neighbors they are looking  
John is down the fun pub  
Drinking lots of lager  
Girls and boys are on the game  
All the high streets look the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back to work a.g.a.i.n.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bank holiday
