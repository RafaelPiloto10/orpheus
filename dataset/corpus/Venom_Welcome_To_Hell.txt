Fight, we will fight right,  
Living low in a world of our own,  
Destined to live right, fight,  
We're taking hell as our home,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.  
  
Kill we will kill death,  
Masturbating on the deeds we have done,  
Hell commands death kill,  
Argue not of feel the death of sun,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.  
  
Leave your souls at his feet,  
Kiss the flames,  
Scorn defeat.  
  
Die we won't die live,  
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know,  
Mortal voids live die,  
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.
