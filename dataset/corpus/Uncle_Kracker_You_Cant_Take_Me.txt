I've been wasting all my time  
And I've been drinkin' all that wine  
And I've been drinkin' all that beer  
And I've been sheddin' all these tears  
  
I can't go but you can't stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go  
  
I've been down this road before  
And I just can not care no more  
I can't see what you can see  
I'm too busy bein' me  
  
See I can't go and you can't stay  
You not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go  
  
I don't need to save no face  
I can't wait to leave this place  
I've been fooled by lesser things  
And I don't care what tomorrow brings  
See I can go but you can't stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go
