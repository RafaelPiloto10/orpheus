An angels kiss is the kiss you gave to me  
An angels touch, has touched my heart  
Your love is something, that's truly heavenly  
Heaven is here in your arms  
I couldn't sleep at night and then you embraced my life  
With your sweet, sexy ways, oh, now I can't even think  
What my life would be, to be without you even one day  
You're the closest thing to heaven in my world  
Never take this heaven from my arms  
Don't take your love from me or you'll take everything  
You're the closest thing to heaven that I've ever seen  
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven, you are, you are  
My happiness is just being next to you  
Your tenderness has touched my soul  
Never knew someone had so much love for me  
I'm never letting you  
I thought no one could care, you answered all my prayers  
With your sweet, sexy ways, oh, you made my life complete  
When you made love to me that's why, I love you more everyday  
You're the closest thing to heaven in my world  
Never take this heaven from my arms  
Don't take your love from me or you'll take everything  
You're the closest thing to heaven that I've ever seen  
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven, you are, you are  
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven, you are, you are  
The one love, I need in my life  
The one touch, I need in night  
You're the answer to all of my prayers  
Promise me you'll always be there  
You're the closest thing to heaven in my world  
Never take this heaven from my arms  
Don't take your love from me or you'll take everything  
You're the closest thing to heaven that I've ever seen  
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven, you are, you are  
You are, you are the closest thing to heaven, you are, you are
