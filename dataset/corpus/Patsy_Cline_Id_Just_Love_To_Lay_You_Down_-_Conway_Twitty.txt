There's a lot of ways of saying what I want to say to you  
There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true  
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground  
I'll come right out and tell you, I'd just love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down  
  
There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home  
You've got a way of doing little things that turn me on  
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown  
With your hair up in curlers, I'd still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down  
  
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face  
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place  
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around  
And if I can I know that I'd still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
