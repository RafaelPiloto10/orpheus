A blank notebook and a back pocket fade  
You used to mock me  
Sometimes I would cry when I was home later  
You hurt my feelings  
Why why why  
Send it down in your notebook  
My wannabe Harriet the spy  
  
And some say your genius  
Is in your madness  
Will you get better  
Then will you leave us?  
How you mixed with the darkness  
At such a young age  
Until in your chemistry  
Science and violence turned  
Silence to rage  
  
Why are you dreaming this,  
One shoe off and a bridge to cross over  
And where is your taxi fare,  
Are you left by yourself or left by your lover?  
For three nights straight now I dream I keep both of my shoes  
But I've forgotten my lines  
And I've misplaced my cues  
And there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,  
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from  
  
There were the secrets  
The big bang and the bigger joke  
You seem to know all of them  
And injustice makes you red with choke  
You love like your desperate  
You don't know what love is  
I thought if there was one thing I could give you  
One thing I could give you,  
Maybe it was this  
  
With your head on the bed board  
The anguished repeat  
The sweat of our sadness  
The twist of the sheets  
I don't want what's best for you,  
Where will I be when you've found it?  
I pray a lot about these bad feelings inside  
But I can't pray my way through or around it
