Music is a mirror  
Near around my soul  
Music is the spirit  
Come on let it roll  
Music is my nature  
People have you heard  
Music is my future  
Music is the world  
Let it all be music  
People sing a song  
Let it all be music  
Let us sing it on and on and on  
Let's play the music  
My kind of music  
Let's play the music  
Play it on and on and on and on  
Music isn't somewhere  
Music turns you right  
Music is a fever  
Leads you day and night  
Music is like heaven  
Where you wanna be  
Music is religion  
Music set's you free  
Let it all be music  
People sing a song  
Let it all be music  
Let us sing it on and on and on  
Let's play the music  
My kind of music  
Let's play the music  
Play it on and on and on and on  
Music is tomorrow  
Music is today  
Music is forever  
Music is the way  
Music is for women  
Music is for men  
Music is for children  
Sing it all again  
Let it all be music  
People sing a song  
Let it all be music  
Let us sing it on and on and on  
Let's play the music  
My kind of music  
Let's play the music  
Play it on and on and on and on
