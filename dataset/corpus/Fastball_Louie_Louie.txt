Sittin' here in your room  
I've been listen' to the freeway and the moon  
Shinin' through  
Broken windows I've been waitin' for ya singin'  
  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to see you cry  
  
Sittin' on the hood of your car  
Starin' up at the sky, wishin' on a fallin' star  
You come so far  
I get no response, I just keep on waiting  
  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to be alone  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to be alone  
  
Sittin' here in your room  
I've been listen' to the freeway and the moon  
Shinin' through  
Broken windows I've been waitin' for ya  
  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to see you cry  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to be alone with myself
