Born to lose I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losin' you  
  
Born to lose it's been so hard to bear  
And when I've waited and I found that you're not there  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose and now I'm losin' you  
  
Mhm all my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm I'm losin' you
