So you wanna see in my life  
So watch but be careful  
I don't give no doubts  
But that it's painful  
  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can understand my pain  
What's it all about  
And I'm not proud  
  
But that's how I've survived  
Living in the shadows  
Walking only in night-time  
Outside  
  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can see I'm not doing well  
Sick and tired of this all  
But I'm not gonna begg  
  
Be me 4...  
Look how I live day by day  
Be me 4...  
This is how I've became of who I am  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can see by yourself  
I'm not insane  
The press is, not me my friend  
  
(I give you this by an honour of Michael) Who we all love so much
