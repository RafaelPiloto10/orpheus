I live in the times  
That you left behind  
I sold 'em my mind for nickels and dimes  
I must have been blind  
  
I search for the cause  
That has no reward  
I've tried to move on  
But everyone's gone on and I  
  
Can't get it back  
No, I can't get it back  
I'm always reaching for the right track  
Where has it gone why can't I get it back  
  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no-one to hold on to  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've nothing to hold onto  
Lost in a daze  
I'll never erase  
  
When radio waves  
Would take us away  
On dreams that we've made  
Like an old song  
  
I just don't belong  
But I try to be strong  
So let the music roll on  
We can't get it back  
  
Yes, I can't get it back  
I'm always listening for the right track  
And when it's gone I want to play it back  
Where have my heroes gone  
  
I've no-one left to hold on to  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
Where have my heroes gone  
  
I've no one left to hold on to, oh  
(Don't let those heroes die  
Their songs have changed our lives  
They came they saw  
  
They conquered all  
Don't let them die  
And say goodbye  
Am I always searching for the right track  
  
Where have they have gone  
Why can't I get it back  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no-one left to hold on to  
  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no one left to hold on to  
They're gone  
  
(Don't let those heroes die  
Their songs have changed our lives  
They came they saw  
They conquered all  
Don't let them die  
And say goodbye)
