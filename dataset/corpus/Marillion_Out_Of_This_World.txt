Three hundred miles an hour on water  
In your purpose-built machine  
No one dared to call a boat  
Screaming blue  
Out of this world  
Make history  
This is your day  
Blue Bird  
  
At such speeds, things fly  
  
What did she say?  
I know the pain of too much tenderness  
Wondering when or if you'll come back again  
Wanting to live for you  
And being banned from giving  
  
But only love will turn you around  
Only love will turn you around  
Only love  
Only love will turn you around  
  
So we live you and I  
Either side of the edge  
And we run and we scream  
With the dilated stare  
Of obsession and dreaming  
What the hell do we want  
Is it only to go  
Where nobody has gone  
A better way than the herd  
Sing a different song  
Till you're running the ledge  
To the gasp from the crowd  
Spinning round in your head  
Everything that she said
