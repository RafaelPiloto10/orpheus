I was just a shadow  
In the beginning  
I was alone  
  
In the beginning, I was blind  
Living in a world devoid of light  
In the beginning  
There was only night  
  
I was shattered  
Left in pieces  
And I felt so cold inside  
Then I called you  
From the darkness  
Where I hide  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
  
In the beginning  
You were evolution  
A river of salvation  
And now I believe  
  
All I wanted  
All I needed  
Was someone to rescue me  
I was drownin'  
I was dying  
Now I'm free  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
  
Here I am now  
I can stand now  
'Cause your love has made me strong  
And forever  
You're the singer  
I'm the song  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you
