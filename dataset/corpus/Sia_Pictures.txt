You have her pictures,  
You have her pictures,  
You have her pictures everywhere.  
  
You're covered in stitches,  
You're covered in stitches,  
You think I can't see them, but I know they're there.  
  
[Chorus]  
Take her down from the wall,  
Let yourself fall,  
You can't keep her frozen, dormant at your court,  
You can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone.  
  
you lost your big heart,  
You lost your big heart,  
You lost your big heart beating bare.  
  
She gave you a new start,  
She gave you a new start,  
But you knew you'd lost her to despair.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your skin burns and prickles,  
Your skin burns and prickles,  
Your skin burns and prickles when she's near.  
  
You try to play it cool,  
You try to play it cool,  
You try to play it cool, but you're filled with fear.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take her down from the wall,  
Let her go make her yours,  
You can't keep her frozen, dormant at your court,  
You can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone.  
You can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone.  
You can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone.  
You can try to move on, or maybe she is the one.
