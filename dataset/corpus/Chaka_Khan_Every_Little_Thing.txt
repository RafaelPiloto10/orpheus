[Chorus:]  
I'll take every little thing I do  
And give it up, give it all up for you  
I mean every little thing, it's true  
Give it up, give it all up for you  
  
Busy, I'm so busy  
Climbing higher, moving further every day  
Gotta keep going, don't you know it  
Can't let sentimental feelings in the way  
  
But there comes a time  
When you want to share your heart  
Give up everything  
And just lose yourself in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep up with the Jones'  
If they got it then you need it right away  
The grass ain't greener, you'll discover  
When you're lonely it don't get better anywhere  
  
'Cause there comes a time in my life  
When I want to share my heart  
Give up everything  
And just lose myself in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Giving you everything  
About to give up everything  
Giving you everything  
  
Good timing is everything  
And right now I'm here for you  
I'll turn the lights down baby  
And lock the door for you
