[Intro]  
I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
  
[Verse 1]  
Girl, I'm watching you  
Loving the way you controlling the scene  
Sexy attitude, talk like you walking  
Your walk is so mean  
They want to hate you  
Hate on you good  
Cause you so damn bad  
I don't condone but I understand it  
Cause it just ain't no fair  
That you look like that  
I'm on it  
  
[Chorus]  
Got me saying  
Where you going? What you getting into?  
I'm coming with you  
Said if it's all good baby girl I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
Cause I'm on you tough  
And I wanna make that move  
I'm coming with you  
I said if it's all good baby girl I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby, pardon me  
If I may come across kind of direct  
My bad baby  
But I been the type to go for what I want  
And I ain't never been checked, no  
But I might let you try  
Girl, what's the business  
I'mma let you decide  
Where it is we go  
Yeah, show me the way you ball so baby  
Sexy to me way you take control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]

Just pick a star and let me take you there  
Baby girl it's you that I want  
And all I know is I'm not leaving here alone  
  
[Chorus]
