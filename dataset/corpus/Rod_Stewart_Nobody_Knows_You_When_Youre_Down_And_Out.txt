Once I lived the life  
of a millionaire  
Spending my money  
Oh I didn't care  
Taking my friends out  
For a mighty good time  
Oh we'd drink that good gin  
Champagne and wine  
  
But oh just as soon  
As my money got low  
I couldn't find nobody  
And I had no place to go  
And if I ever get my hands  
On a dollar again  
I'm gonna hold on  
Till the eagle wins  
Cause I found out  
  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
  
Lord have mercy  
  
Yeah, yeah, now listen  
Now in your pocket  
There's not one penny  
And all of them good friends  
You found out you haven't got any  
Nobody come around  
But the landlord and the taxman  
Your ex-wife who says  
She wants more alimony  
Then there's a knock on the door  
And it's a woman you don't know  
Says she's having your baby  
She'll walk on in  
  
But oh just as soon  
as the money roll in  
Here they all come sayings  
That they're you're long lost friends  
But if I ever get my hands  
On a dollar again  
I believe, I believe I'll hold on  
Till the eagle wins  
Cause I found out  
  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody, nobody, nobody
