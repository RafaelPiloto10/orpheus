The phoenix he helped create,  
Out of control boy without a dad,  
Shot the gun that startled my life,  
While I drove him with a forty-five.  
  
Friends for years images in red,  
Blew off his own mother-fuckin head,  
Confidence, death, insecurity,  
Men fall unrealized,  
Unrealized, unrealized.  
  
Making a decision of death,  
While everyone around you pled,  
Now you fly in peace,  
I hope, my friend,  
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do,  
When he's meant to do it,  
Even if he doesn't really want to,  
My memories are of fun and friendship,  
Of weakness within the strength of youth,  
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined,  
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined.  
  
Friends for years images in red,  
Blew off his own mother-fuckin head,  
Confidence, death, insecurity,  
Men fall unrealized,  
  
Don't you realize,  
Evil, lives in the m-fucking skin,  
Don't you realize,  
Evil, lives in the m-fucking skin,  
  
Unrealized, unrealized.  
  
Don't you, realize, evil,  
Lives in the mother-fucking skin,  
Don't you, realize , that evil,  
Lives in the mother-fucking.
