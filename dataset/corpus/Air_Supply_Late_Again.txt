I'm late again, oh how the evening flies  
You meet old friends and share the secrets they hide  
It's not like me, to be this much unconcerned  
The drinks are free, I know this time I will bur  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here.  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Ooooooohhhh, I'm late again  
  
So I get home, and nothing there seems the same.  
I'm walking slow, and no one remembers my name  
I bring a smile, and, saying I'm losing my mind  
I realize that you've been wasting my time  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Oooohhhhh, I'm late again....Yeah....  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
No one home, yes I'm late again.....  
Our love, guess I'll wait again.....  
  
REPEAT
