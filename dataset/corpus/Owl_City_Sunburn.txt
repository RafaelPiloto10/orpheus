So there we were, back home  
From somewhere inside my head  
Well bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed  
Pillars of post-war books supported my frame of mind  
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind  
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me  
The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see  
Implying that she's the bees knees and I am the cats meow  
It's funny how she recalls when I can't remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
Yeah, but she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
I got a sunburn  
  
So there we were out there  
Unaware of where we'd been  
We kicked off our flip-flops  
And swung from the rooftops again  
It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about  
And it's funny how I recall when she can't remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
Yeah, But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
Oh afterglow, look out below!  
We'd left a trail of dust behind  
As we parted ways, she held my gaze,  
And left an imprint on my mind  
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye  
And hung the clouds above my town  
But I shed a tear when she disappeared  
'Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
She got a tan and I got a sunburn  
Yeah, but she got a tan and I got a sunburn
