It takes time  
To get your gal to see the light  
It takes time  
It isn't always love at sight  
From the first little glance  
Till she's ready for romance  
Remember, little man, it takes time  
  
It takes time  
To make the coffee percolate  
It takes time  
To get your gal to set the date  
From the first moonlight walk  
Till you get the baby talk  
Remember, little man, it takes time  
  
Now, Rome wasn't built in a day they say  
Not to mention the Pyramids and Sphinx  
It took old Rip Van Winkle all of twenty years  
To squeeze the livin' daylights out of forty winks  
  
It takes time  
To turn the winter into spring  
It takes time  
To get the dough to get the ring  
From the first little smile  
Till you're walkin' down the aisle  
Remember, little man, it takes time  
  
It takes time  
To make the coffee percolate  
It takes time  
To get your gal to set the date  
From the first moonlight walk  
Till you get the baby talk  
Remember, little man, it takes time  
  
Now, Rome wasn't built in a day they say  
Not to mention the Pyramids and Sphinx  
It took old Rip Van Winkle all of twenty years  
To squeeze the livin' daylights out of forty winks  
  
It takes time  
To turn the winter into spring  
It takes time  
To get the dough to get the ring  
From the first little smile  
Till you're walkin' down the aisle  
Remember, little man, it takes time
