I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
I'm the colorless sunrise  
That's never good enough  
I'm the wind that's in your head  
It ruffles you up  
You could find the reason  
You could let me know  
I won't blame you  
I'll just turn and go  
  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
Searching to find myself  
And all I find is you  
I could hardly stand myself  
So what am I to you?  
You could find a reason  
You could let me know  
I won't blame you  
I just didn't go  
  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
No matter, no matter  
No matter what we're facing  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
'Cause the reason that I'm here  
Is the same through all these years  
Not changing, not changing anything at all  
  
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night
