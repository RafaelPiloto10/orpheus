I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely  
I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue  
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry  
Wondering what in the world did I do  
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you  
I'm crazy for thinking
