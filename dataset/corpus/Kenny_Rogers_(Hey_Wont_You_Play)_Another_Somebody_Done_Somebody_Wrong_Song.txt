It's so lonely out tonight  
And the feeling just got right  
For a brand new love song  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
  
Hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
So play, play for me a sad melody  
So sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong  
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone  
  
So hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
So, play, play for me a sad melody  
So, sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong  
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone  
  
Hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
I miss my baby
