If you want to go riding  
In the tall green grass,  
Try to not spook the horse.  
  
If you want to pet  
That old hound dog,  
Make sure he ain't  
Rolled in shit.  
  
There's a pretty little girl,  
And she's living down there,  
Down on her daddy's farm.  
  
If you're going to mess  
Around with that chick,  
Be sure to close the barn door.  
  
Try to not spook the horse.  
Make sure she ain't  
Rolled in shit.  
  
There's a field of green  
And an old red barn  
Deep in the valley of hearts.  
  
If you want to go riding  
In the tall green grass  
Try to not spook the horse.  
  
Try to not spook the horse.  
Try to not spook the horse.
