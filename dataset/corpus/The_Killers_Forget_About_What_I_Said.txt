We used to tear it down,  
But now we just exist.  
The things that I did wrong,  
I'll bet you've got a list.  
  
Now I know how you remember  
And those moments that you choose  
Will define me as a traitor,  
Stealing everything you lose.  
  
Forget about what I said,  
The lights are gone and the party's over.  
Forget about what I said.  
Forget about what I said,  
I'm older now, and I know you hear me.  
Forget about what I said.  
  
You'll stay up late tonight,  
You'll turn off your phone.  
Well you were selfish, too,  
But you were never all alone.  
In those ugly pink apartments  
With the hustlers and the kids,  
Mapping out some retribution.  
Do we have to go through this?  
  
Forget about what I said,  
The lights are gone and the party's over.  
Forget about what I said.  
Forget about what I said,  
I'm older now, and I know you hear me.  
Forget about what I said.  
  
All of the stars are wandering around tonight,  
We used to try them on.  
And sometimes I hear you,  
The galaxy sings your song.  
And tonight I sing along.  
  
Forget about what I said,  
The lights are gone and the party's over.  
Forget about what I said.  
Forget about what I said,  
I'm older now, and I know you hear me.  
Forget about what I said.  
  
Forget about what I said,  
The lights are gone and the party's over.  
Forget about what I said.  
Forget about what I said,  
I'm older now, and I know you hear me.  
Forget about what I said.  
  
Forget about what I said,  
The lights are gone and the party's over.  
Forget about what I said.  
Forget about what I said,  
I'm older now, and I know you hear me.  
Forget about what I said.
