Some boys kiss me,  
Some boys hug me,  
I think they're ok  
If they don't give me copper pennies  
I just walk away  
  
Some boys beg and some boys plead  
But they don't see the light  
Only the boy with the  
Cold harsh cash  
Is always Mr. Right  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Some boys moan and some boys groan  
And that's alright with me  
If they can't raise my interest,  
Then I have to let them be.  
Some boys cry and some boys die  
But I don't let them play  
Only boys that save their pennies  
Make my rainy day!  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Boys may come  
And boys may go  
And that's alright you see  
Experience had made me rich  
And they're after me!  
  
Were living in a material world  
And I am a material girl
