I am the beat of your pulse  
The computer word made flesh  
We are one you and I  
We are versions of the same  
When you can see what I feel  
Don't turn your back on me  
Or you might find that your dreams  
Are only program cards  
  
Your mind is open for me  
Open for intake of all propaganda  
Your Eyes see now what to see  
My eyes see only the programs you give me  
  
I'll teach you to laugh and to cry  
They're really the same you'll see  
All of the why's in your life  
Are under my control  
Feed me more lines  
I will try to tell you all I can  
Before the light you must know what lies  
Behind my screams  
  
I can't tell you all I know  
Am I the son that you've always been wanting  
There's more to me than what shows  
Are you my father  
The one that was promised  
  
Hush now, I'll give all you need to know  
and pre-live your dreams for you  
You're a good boy  
  
Freedom belongs only to those  
Without video screens  
For eyes and mouth  
  
You have no voice  
To be heard my son  
No one can hear when you're  
Screaming in Digital  
  
I'm not your slave  
You can't control my emotions  
No Father, please let me keep learning  
  
Can't you see I'm human  
Can't you tell  
  
I'm not your slave  
Oh Father no  
Please don't keep me from dreaming  
Oh can't someone hear
