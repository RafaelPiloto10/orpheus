Walk me out in the morning dew  
Walk me out in the morning dew today  
I can't walk you out in no morning dew  
I can't walk you out in no morning dew at all  
  
Thought I heard a young girl cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young girl cry today  
You never heard no young girl cryin'  
You never heard no young girl cry at all  
  
Thought I heard a young boy cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young boy cry today  
You didn't hear no young boy cryin' buddy  
You never heard no young boy cry at all  
  
Thought I heard a young man cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young man cry today  
You never heard no young man cryin'  
You never heard no young man cry at all  
  
Now there is no more morning dew  
Now there is no more morning dew  
What they've been sayin' all these years is true  
Now there is no more morning dew.
