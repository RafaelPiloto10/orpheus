Sell me candy like it's summer when it's melting in my hands  
I know you're around like the ice cream man  
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear  
You seem like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear  
I'm weak by your touch and when it's melting on my lips  
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips  
You're selling me your fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good it's got me rockin' through the core  
  
[Bridge:]  
Talk to me  
Take in my dreams  
All I need  
Is you beside me  
It's destiny  
Just let it be  
If words can speak  
Baby, tell it to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sell me candy  
Sell me love  
Sell me hope  
Sell me doves  
What's the charge?  
What's the cost?  
(I'm the daddy)  
You the boss  
  
Be a professional, boy, you make a sale  
I try to resist but every time I fail  
The one temptation that I gotta enjoy  
You're runnin' through my gun when you're knockin' at my door  
A thin little kiss, and your call is really sweet  
But the shawty that you're rockin' is nothing like me  
You're selling me a fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good it's got me rockin' through the core (you know?)  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna play more than you know  
So don't you leave, and don't you go  
I want it all until time falls  
His arms I want to roam  
I want to love, give him my trust  
I want to live for both of us  
I want to breathe you, lay on your shoulder  
I want to warm you when nights get colder  
I want love, love, love  
I want love, love, love  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
