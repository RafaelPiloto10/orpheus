General joy I know I know  
You'll take me there  
Where your boys were left behind  
  
General joy it seems you need  
A soldier girl -  
Now "they" have liberty gagged  
  
By boat by tram by motorbus  
Could it be the fates are protecting us  
From the hawks that have stolen the bird from the sky  
  
And I know  
You will always love sorrow  
Is that why  
You gave her dress to happiness?  
Cause it matches her eyes  
When she cries  
  
General joy it seems  
You don't love your bride  
Generally  
You're friends but she is not the love of your life  
  
To dye to perm to change your hair or your wife  
The possibilities are there  
And it's time for you to decide  
  
General joy I know I know  
You'll take me there  
But you'll need strength  
From within  
General joy it seems you need  
A soldier girl  
And a willing coalition  
  
By boat by tram by motorbus  
Could it be the hawks are protecting us  
From the men who have now assumed their name
