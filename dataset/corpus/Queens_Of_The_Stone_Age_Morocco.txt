The astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
The fabric of the universe  
Out of which this earth is woven  
The moon is a mirror alike  
She returns my loving  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
The astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Maybe it won't be that far  
It won't be long before we're getting  
To enjoy this setting  
  
We're getting closer to where we're heading  
We've been chosen  
To enjoy this setting  
  
That astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
Into fata morgana's I melt  
Onto the buckle of orion's belt
