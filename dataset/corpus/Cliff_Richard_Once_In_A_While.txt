I think of this, most every night  
How hard it is to get it alright  
I'm lookin' here and I'm lookin' there  
I see heart broken pieces everywhere  
Wouldn't you try wouldn't you know  
Try so hard still you let it all go  
Too much trouble too much pain  
I think I'm gonna have that luck again  
  
What'll I do if you walk away  
What'll I do if you walk away  
Well I haven't a chance  
No I haven't a chance  
  
Once in a while I get this feelin'  
Now and again I'm all in a daze  
Time after time I ask myself this  
Will you walk away?  
Once in a while I get this feelin'  
Seems all day and night time too  
I don't belong I'm just passin' through  
I guess you're right I think too much  
Still in all, I miss your touch  
A crazy notion a careless thought  
I start to worry and time gets short  
Well think of this my dear young one  
The time to act has just begun  
  
What'll I do if you walk away  
What'll I do if you walk away  
Well I haven't a chance  
No I haven't a chance
