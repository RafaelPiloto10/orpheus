(D. Del, M. Wilkins)  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
  
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
  
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
  
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear  
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries on my bones
