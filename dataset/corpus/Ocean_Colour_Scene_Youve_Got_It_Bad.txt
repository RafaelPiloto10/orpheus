And if I could hold you where would you belong  
Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
And if I could listen to half the words you say  
Would your pathway glisten and help you on your way  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so bad  
Worse than any other  
  
If I was in your shoes would it be the same  
Would you sit in silence while I dish out the blame  
And if the world was laughing would you close your ears  
There is no creed of chanting to make the world more clear  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so so bad  
Worse than any other  
  
If I bought you flowers would you watch them grow  
Spring time is for certain to follow on the snow  
And if I could hold you where would you belong  
Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so so bad  
Worse than any other
