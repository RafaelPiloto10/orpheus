When I met you, you were too young,  
To hang around where the hippies hung,  
To swing and dance where the swingers swung,  
  
Well you're ready now, mmmm you're ready now,  
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.  
  
You grew up fast like over-night,  
You sure have changed, girl, you're out of sight,  
You wanna swing and dance all night,  
  
You're ready now, you're ready now,  
You're ready now, oh, you're ready now.  
  
You pick up quick, I knew you would,  
You move and groove just the way you should,  
You've got that feel of running good,  
  
Well you're ready now, oh, you're ready now,  
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.  
  
Come on near me, (come on baby)

You've got that wiggle in the way you walk,  
You've got, i see, what gets to me,
