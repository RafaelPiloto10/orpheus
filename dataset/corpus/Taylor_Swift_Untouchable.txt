Untouchable like  
A distant diamond sky  
  
I'm reaching out  
And I just  
Can't tell you why  
  
I'm caught up in you  
I'm caught up in you  
  
Untouchable burning  
Brighter than the sun  
And when you're close  
I feel like coming undone  
  
In the middle of the night  
When I'm in this dream  
It's like  
A million little stars  
Spelling out your name  
You gotta come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
Little taste of heaven  
  
It's half full  
And I won't wait here  
All day  
I know you're saying  
That you'd be here  
Anyway  
  
But you're  
Untouchable burning  
Brighter than the sun  
Now that you're close  
I feel like coming undone  
  
In the middle of the night  
When I'm in this dream  
It's like  
A million little stars  
Spelling out your name  
You gotta, come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
  
In the middle of the night  
Wakin' from this dream  
I wanna feel you  
By my side  
Standing next to me  
You gotta, come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
Little taste of heaven  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
I'm caught  
Up in you  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
It's your  
Untouchable burning  
Brighter than the sun  
Now that you're close  
I feel like coming undone  
  
In the middle of the night  
When I'm in this dream  
It's like  
A million little stars  
Spelling out your name  
You gotta come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
Oh, oh  
  
In the middle of the night  
When I'm in this dream  
It's like  
A million little stars  
Spelling out your name  
You gotta, come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
Come on  
  
In the middle of the night  
We can form this dream  
I wanna feel you by my side  
Standing next to me  
You gotta, come on, come on  
Say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on  
Little taste of heaven
