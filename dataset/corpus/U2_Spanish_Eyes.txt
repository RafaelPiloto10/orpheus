Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Empty heart, beat tight as a drum set  
Empty love, she'd shine like a song  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on (to anything)  
  
Our love shines like rain  
In those Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
Wey hey hey, here she comes  
She comes in colors  
You know she gonna turn the daylight on  
'Cause I love the way you talk to me  
And I love the way you walk on me  
And I need you more  
Oh, than you need me  
  
Our love shines like rain  
In those Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
I'll cross the world for green and gold  
But it's those Spanish eyes  
That get me home...home again  
  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Wey hey hey, you know that  
The night is young  
Dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes  
I'm standing in the shadows  
And wait for the night  
Forever in fever, forever in heat  
You pick me up to put me out on the street  
  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on  
'Cause I love the way you talk to me  
And I love the way you're mean to me  
And I need you
