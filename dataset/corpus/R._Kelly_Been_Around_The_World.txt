[Chorus]  
I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me  
  
I been around the world and back like what up  
East side to west side touring like what up  
And even though the price for the house was so much  
I still roll with them from the hood like what up  
Cause when it comes to being the realest I'm sure 'nough  
I'm a straight up industry villain for sure 'nough  
And I can't satisfy some a y'all no matter what  
And some of y'all cats are so jealous  
Said we livin in a cold cold world  
Ain't nothin' but fake faces fake people fake friends  
Said we living in a cold cold world  
Where there ain't nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas  
Yea I know I need a hug but y'all need a hug too  
'cause god gunna judge me the same day he judge you  
And even though we have our struggles that's alright  
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ja Rule]  
Sometimes this world can be so cold  
When you looking through the windows of the soul  
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds  
Cause I been around this globe and back  
Enough to know the fact  
Who loves me  
And who loves me not  
We be shit's so hot  
You could put it in red tops  
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block  
Until they heart stops  
That's why they fiend for me  
And I thank you for every blessing that you giving me lord  
And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords  
And all these haters I keep shaking 'em off  
Rubbing they face in fame  
I'm sorry I changed the game  
But its mine and I can't complain  
Rule and are Kelly  
Been around the world  
Putting it on women  
Bumping and grinding these bitches  
But we always on time when a woman fed up  
And that's love  
That's why they all fuck wit us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said my lyrics is my testimony  
That's how I live  
I had to get rid of a lot of fake homies  
Over the years  
You see me on TV sometimes  
Not how it is  
Y'all gotta start learning how to separate me from showbiz  
When I'm rolling through your city  
Show me love  
And ladies when you see a boy  
Give me love  
And though I'm not conceited (right)  
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)  
Said I got so many friends in them area codes  
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows  
Ja lets break bread together  
Pray together  
That we grow strong together  
Its clear forever  
Help each other through the stormy weather  
Lets hurt together  
Lets cry together  
And even if we grow together  
Then together we'll make it better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me
