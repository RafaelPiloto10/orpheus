It's mine but you can have some  
With you I'd like to share it  
'Cause if I share it with you  
You'll have some too  
Well if I have a cake to eat  
If I have a tasty treat  
If you come to me and ask  
I'll give some to you  
It's mine but you can have some  
With you I'd like to share it  
'Cause if I share it with you  
You'll have some too  
And if I have a book to read  
If I have a block you need  
If you come to me and ask  
I'll share it with you
