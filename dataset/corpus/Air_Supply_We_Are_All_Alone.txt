We are all alone that's the way it seems to be  
Love is in my sight and I can see it if you can  
Where do we come from, I've been waiting for so long  
We are all alone, say you will.  
The lights have all gone home and are safely tucked away  
There's nothing to come between us but the words we've got to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Where do we come from I've been waiting for so long  
We are all alone.  
And now we are both here are we really within reach  
Of the things we need to do see'est a ou see'est la vie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now we can both spend all the time that's come our way  
I'm not going to let you go for another single day  
  
[Chorus]
