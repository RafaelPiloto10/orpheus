I know we're both married  
Yet we're both alone  
He's always working  
And she's never home  
If we got together  
It would be so good  
But under these conditions  
I don't think we should  
  
'Cause we both have children  
And they need us around  
Although we're both willing  
We can't let 'em down  
As much as we want to  
You know where we stand  
Under these conditions  
I don't think we can  
  
We love each other  
But it's only in dreams  
But we have to get used to the fact  
It's just one of those things  
We'll never know how  
This love could feel  
And under these conditions  
We never will
