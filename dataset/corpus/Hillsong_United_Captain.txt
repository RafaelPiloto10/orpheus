Through waters uncharted my soul will embark  
I'll follow Your voice straight into the dark  
And if from the course You intend I depart  
Speak to the sails of my wandering heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Like the wind You'll guide  
Clear the skies before me  
And I'll glide this open sea  
Like the stars, Your Word  
Will align my voyage  
And remind me where I've been  
And where I am going  
  
Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog  
Your truth is the compass  
That points me back north  
Jesus, my Captain  
My soul's trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jesus, my Captain  
My soul's trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours
