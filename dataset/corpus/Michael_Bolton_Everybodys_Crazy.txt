Sweet little girl, she's the high school queen  
She lives tonight, in every school boys' dream  
Oh, but nobody knows how she's cryin'  
She's just a child goin' on seventeen  
She gets so confused by her friends and their scenes  
They don't mean what they say  
They don't say what they mean  
She reads the signs, reads between the lines  
But it makes no difference  
There's no reason or rhyme  
Just hold on girl, as long as you can  
In time you'll learn what you don't understand  
It's the human condition, it's the nature of man  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
This city boy, he don't want no control  
He just wanna party and play his rock 'n' roll  
But here they come to turn the pressure on  
Say'n son, your partyin' days are gone  
The time has come now to be a man  
Find your place in the world, gotta take what you can  
You've got no ambition, take a look at yourself  
When ya gonna straighten out, be like everybody else  
The boy said listen dad, you're bringin' me down  
I am who I am, I've had a good look around  
There's one thing in the world I can tell you I've found  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
There ain't no wonder things are so outta hand  
Sooner or later, ya come to understand  
The human condition, it's the nature of man  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy
