I see you baby  
Every single day  
Holding on to my best friend  
But you don't see me  
  
So I make the same request now  
Every single night  
Going out from me to you  
On the dedication line  
  
I wonder if you're listening  
To the words that keep me wishing  
That one day I'll be kissing you  
  
Wo wo wo

My secret admiration  
I won't reveal  
I wouldn't want to hurt no one  
By tellin' how I feel  
  
The DJ knows my voice now  
He even knows my choice now  
He never says my name  
He just says "From the one  
Who loves you baby"

One night you'll hear a song  
And then you'll know just who it's from  
  
(Rap) I see you baby, every single day  
Holding on to my best friend  
But you don't see me  
I wonder if you're listening  
To the words that keep me wishing  
That one day I'll be kissing you  
  
Wo wo wo
