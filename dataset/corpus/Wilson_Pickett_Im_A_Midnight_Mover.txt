I'm a midnight mover  
All night through  
I'm a midnight teaser  
Real soul pleaser  
I'm a midnight hugger  
All night long  
And a lover  
Trust in me when you're down and out  
I will always bring you up  
They call me the midnight mover  
I'm a midnight walker  
Sweet soul talker  
I'm a midnight creeper  
All day sleeper  
I'm a midnight rover  
Have to look things over  
Leave your love light shinin' bright  
Makes me know that everything's all right  
I'm a mover, groover, teaser, pleasure  
Hugger, lover, walker, talker  
Got to be a midnight mover  
Got to be a midnight groover  
Got to be a midnight teaser  
Got to be a midnight pleasure  
Got to be a midnight hunger  
Got to be a midnight lover  
Got to be a midnight walker  
Got to be a midnight talker  
Got to be a midnight creeper
