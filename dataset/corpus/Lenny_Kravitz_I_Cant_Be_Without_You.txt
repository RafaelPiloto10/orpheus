Sometimes I don't feel alive  
Why do I keep running from the truth?  
I can see it in my eyes  
Where's the happiness that I once knew?  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I keep my head to the sky  
Waiting for the day that you'll come through  
I am free within my mind  
'Cause I know that it is coming soon  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know another day with you, ah
