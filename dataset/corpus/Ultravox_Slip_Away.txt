Enter me gently  
I break in the light  
Cover my eyes  
With the rags of my life  
Was I dreaming?  
Or did you say  
"The frontiers are falling  
It's time to be slipping away  
Let's slip away, let's slip away"  
All things fall from me  
The bonds and the veils  
All things blow by me  
My sorrows have sails  
Was I dreaming?  
Or did you say  
"The empires are fading  
It's time to be slipping away  
Let's slip away, let's slip away"  
What am I to do? Don't leave me  
What is there to say? I really  
We're just wasting time  
Let the night takes its place  
Color my eyes  
With the dusk of this wonderful day  
Let's slip away, let's slip away  
Letters from lovers  
Are lining my grave  
Some came too early  
And some came too late  
Were you speaking?  
Or did I say  
"The frontiers have fallen  
It's time to be slipping away"  
"As you call me  
My hands they fall open  
My mouth, it is frozen  
The [Incomprehensible] stumbles  
I'm falling slow-motion, dissolve"
