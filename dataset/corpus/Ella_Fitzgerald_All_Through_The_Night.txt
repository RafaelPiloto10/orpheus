The day is my enemy, the night my friend,  
For I'm always so alone  
Till the day draws to an end.  
But when the sun goes down  
And the moon comes through,  
To the monotone of the evening's drone  
I'm all alone with you.  
  
All through the night,  
I delight in your love,  
All through the night, you're so close to me.  
All through the night, from a height far above,  
You and your love brings me ecstasy.  
  
When dawn comes to waken me  
You're never there at all.  
I know you've forsaken me,  
Till the shadows fall.  
But then once again  
I can dream,  
I've the right  
To be close to you  
All through the night.
