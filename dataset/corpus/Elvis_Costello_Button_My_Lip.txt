Don't want to talk about the government  
Don't want to talk about some incident  
Don't want to talk about some peppermint gum  
Don't want to talk about the time to come  
  
Button my lip  
'Til I'm smart enough  
  
Don't raise your hand  
'Cos I'm not offering  
It serves you right  
Now you are suffering  
Give me a chance  
To see it though  
It all depends on what you hold is true  
  
Button my lip  
With your kiss  
  
Don't want to hear some little sniveling  
You just don't get what I'm delivering  
Maybe you want me  
But you know you can't  
I'd say, 'I want you?  
But you know I don't  
  
Button my lip  
'Til I'm old enough  
'Til I'm smart enough  
'Til I'm?  
Button my lip  
  
Don't want to come at your beckoning  
For any day they'll be a reckoning  
Don't want to hear what is impossible  
Baby, you've become invisible  
  
Button my lip  
  
I've seen those clowns vacant and insolent  
I stand accused but I am innocent  
I am the mighty and magnificent
