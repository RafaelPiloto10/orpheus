And so we say  
We ain't got life  
Don't want a cardboard cut-out  
Don't want a plastic knife  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
And so we say  
Have you no use  
For eight million hands  
And the power of youth  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
It's gonna be a burn out!  
  
And so we say  
We ain't diggin' no graves  
We're diggin' a foundation  
For a future to be made  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
It's gonna be a burn out!
