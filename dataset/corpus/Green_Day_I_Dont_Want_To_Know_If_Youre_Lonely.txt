[Verse:]  
I'm curious to know exactly how you are  
I keep my distance but that distance is too far  
It reassures me just to know that you're okay  
But I don't want you to go on needing me this way  
[Chorus:]  
(And I)  
Don't wanna know if you are lonely  
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely  
Don't wanna know if you are lonely  
Don't wanna know, don't want to know  
[Verse 2:]  
The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad  
Still I'm not sure about all the doubts we had  
From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last  
Decisions have been made, the die has been cast  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:]  
[Verse 3:]  
The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 am  
If it's your friends, well I don't wanna hear from them  
So leave your number and a message at the tone  
Or you can just go on and leave me here alone  
[Chorus:]
