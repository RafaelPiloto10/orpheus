What can I do  
What can I do  
Much of what you say is true  
I know you see through me  
But there's no tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
  
Right and wrong  
Right and wrong  
Never helped us get along  
You say you care for me  
But there's no tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
  
You and me were such good friends  
What's your hurry?  
You and me could make amends  
I'm not worried  
I'm not worried  
  
Honesty  
Honesty  
It's such a waste of energy  
No you don't have to lie to me  
Just give me some tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
You don't have to lie to me  
Just give me some tenderness
