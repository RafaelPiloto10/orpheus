So this is Christmas  
And what have you done  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun  
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones  
The old and the young  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas (war is over)  
And what have you done (war is over)  
Another year over (war is over)  
And a new one just begun (war is over)  
And so this is Christmas (war is over)  
For weak and for strong (war is over)  
For rich and the poor ones (war is over)  
The war is so long (now)  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
War is over, if you want it  
War is over now  
War is over, if you want it  
War is over now
