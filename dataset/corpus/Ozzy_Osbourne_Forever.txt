There's no present there's no future  
I don't even know about the past  
It's all timeless and never ending  
To take it in it's all too vast  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
The time is coming but also going  
And it's leaving never to return  
Maybe forever it could be heaven  
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
I got to travel forever  
It's all within my mind  
An endless path to endeavour  
But forever is A long long time  
There's no secrets and no corruption  
In the centre of infinity  
There's no limits in non-Existence  
And no begining to my destiny  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
Journey to the centre of eternity
