I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrender  
All I am is Yours  
I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrendered  
All I am is Yours  
I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered  
All I am is Yours  
I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered  
All I am is Yours  
I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered  
All I am, all I am is Yours  
I'll stand, I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned  
In awe of the one who gave it all  
I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered  
All I am is Yours
