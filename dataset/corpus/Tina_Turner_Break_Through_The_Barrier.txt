Look for empty roads to travel  
And grab some peace of mind  
When my life seems to unravel  
Strength from you I'll find  
Like the ocean and the sunshine  
I'll keep trying till you're all mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Till the moment is right  
I won't give up the fight  
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
Like a phoenix arises  
Ain't no mountain too high  
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
  
Like the eyes of total strangers  
Our future is unknown  
In a world of hidden danger  
Don't want to be all alone  
Like a rainbow and the starlight  
I'll keep holding on till you're mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it seems that odds are all against you  
Gotta reach inside and find the strength to pull you through  
  
It's not enough to love each other, baby  
To make it right is gonna take some time  
If I could only break through your barrier
