(Shout)  
(Shout)  
Look in these eyes  
These eyes don't lie  
And they say that if you don't blink,  
Then you don't die.  
  
Now feel this heart  
It beats so tough  
And if you ever gonna doubt my faith  
Then I'll call your bluff  
Cause you ain't that tough  
  
The lies in your eyes can't defeat me  
I ain't ever goin' down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you can't beat me  
Oh, and that's why I gotta stay  
And that's why I gotta say  
  
I'm undefeated  
And standing tall (tall)  
I don't want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all.  
I'm undefeated  
I got this scar (scar)  
I will wash this blood away,  
Live to fight another day  
Undefeated!  
(Shout!)  
I'm undefeated!  
(Shout!)  
  
I feel your pain  
I hear your words.  
But there ain't nothing you can say to me  
I ain't already heard  
  
These cuts run deep  
Close to the bone  
But I gotta keep getting up  
Cause I been down so long  
So let's get it on  
  
The lies in your eyes can't defeat me  
I ain't ever goin' down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you can't beat me  
Oh, and that's why I gotta stay  
And that's why I gotta say  
  
I'm undefeated  
And standing tall (tall)  
I don't want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all.  
I'm undefeated  
I got this scar (scar)  
I will wash this blood away,  
Live to die another day  
  
I walk through the fire  
With the flames on my skin  
I wanna be the last man standing  
I'll never surrender, I'll never give in  
I just got to win  
  
The lies in your eyes can't defeat me  
I ain't ever goin' down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you can't beat me  
Oh, and that's why I gotta stay  
And that's why I gotta say  
  
I'm undefeated  
And standing tall (tall)  
I don't want to be the loser  
When the winner takes it all.  
I'm undefeated  
I got this scar (scar)  
I will wash this blood away,  
Live to fight another day  
I'm undefeated!  
  
It's stand or fall! (fall)  
You can laugh and walk around me with my back against the wall  
I'm undefeated  
I got the prize (prize)  
If you got the will to win  
You got to take it on the chin  
Stay undefeated!  
(Shout!)  
Yea undefeated!  
(Shout!)
