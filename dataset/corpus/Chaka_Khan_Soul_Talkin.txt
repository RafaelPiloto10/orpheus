Some girls need emotion  
Some girls just want some fun  
Some look for devotion  
Some just wanna run  
Some crave for affection  
Burnin' up inside  
Some need the direction  
For the world outside  
You can dance the dance 'til the mornin' comes  
But I'll tell you where I'm comin' from  
CHORUS:  
I wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
It's the heart of the matter  
It's the root of the cause  
It's the still of the moment  
It's that heavenly pause  
Well I don't need a savior  
And I don't need a slave  
I just want to hear you  
Through that magnetic wave  
What I need is a link to the inner mind  
If you want to know my bottom line
