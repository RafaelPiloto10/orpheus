In a western town, beneath the northern lights,  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night,  
You believe in cards and you believe in signs  
And I'll be leavin' soon, but I'm here tonight  
  
On a mountainside, well below the stars  
Keep your lovers eyes in mason jars  
And I should be scared but I feel no fear  
Cause I'll be leavin' soon, tonight I'm here  
  
And even if you are the one  
And even if the cards are all true  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
  
Well the southern pea moved her family down  
Then along came me to her sleepy town  
I don't believe in cards, I don't believe in signs  
But I'll be leavin' soon. I'm here tonight  
  
And even if you are the one, and even if I tried to be true  
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
  
In a western town, beneath the northern lights  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night  
Don't believe in me, did I make that clear?  
Cause I'll be long gone soon, but tonight I'm here  
  
And even if you were the one  
I didn't wanna walk out on you  
But when the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?
