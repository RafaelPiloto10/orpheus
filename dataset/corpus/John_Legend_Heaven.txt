Heaven only knows[x5]  
  
Last night was the worst night  
Beginning of the end  
Or maybe it began  
Before it here we go again  
Things got so dramatic  
Things got out of hand  
We said words we couldn't imagine  
I don't understand  
  
There you go with the same old thing  
When things go wrong, you always seem to blame me  
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind  
Where the end will go  
Will I ever know?  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven only knows  
Heaven only knows  
Heaven only knows  
Heaven only knows  
  
So let's make this night the best night  
It's time for second chance  
Turn the beat up on repeat, and we can start to dance  
  
Sometimes when we talking words  
Drowned on by the sound  
Let's get back to touch, and we'll get back on solid ground  
  
Let's hold hands  
Like a young romance  
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did  
Can we make love  
Like back way in the day?  
We can lose control  
Baby, don't say no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So will you come back to me?  
Heaven only knows  
So will you come back to me?  
  
Make this night the best night  
It's time for second chance  
Turn the beat up on repeat, and we can start to dance  
  
[Chorus]
