[Verse:]  
Stare in the face of the grim death  
Screaming monsters bring me to deafness  
My dagger and swagger are useless in the faze of the mirror  
When the mirror is made of my face  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of daemons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms from a daemon... S  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Hide yo heart in yo gut  
But for what? When they're waiting to pull you apart like a scarecrow  
On death row, soon now all of your secrets are shown  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of daemons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms from a daemon... S  
  
[Bridge:]  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even
