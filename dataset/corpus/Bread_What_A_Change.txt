You could be the answer to my lonely dream  
It's my only dream  
Dream it every night  
It's about a girl who makes the waters still  
Takes my troubled mind  
And makes it all seem right  
  
Oh what a change, what a change that would be  
I can feel it comin' over me,  
Maybe it's strange, strange to say  
But I can't remember how  
How it used to be.  
  
You could be the answer or another dream  
Just another dream  
How will I know  
I'm afraid to wake up now and face the day  
Comes the light of day  
She'll have to go or stay  
  
Oh what a change, what a change that would be  
Just to wake and find you still here,  
'Cause every time, time before  
When I open up my eyes  
You always disappear.  
  
We could sit and hope that you'll be seen  
We could talk about the world and in between,  
And when the morning light was through  
Then I could see if it was really you.
