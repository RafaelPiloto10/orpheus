Yo  
Check this here  
There nothin' that  
I'd rather do  
Than spend some time  
With you  
So why don't  
We just chill?  
Make it coco sexy  
You know  
You sure make it right  
Spend some quality time  
You make me want to  
Cha cha cha  
  
Oh baby, you sure like to  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
We've been hangin' out  
Everyday this week  
How about I fix you  
A little something to eat  
And just chill  
We got a while  
Right now just chill  
Parle lil' momma, right here  
Sippin' on Chardonnay  
Slip on that  
Victoria Secret lingerie  
'Cause I ain't gonna  
Throw my money away  
If I can see you talk it  
Out for me  
  
[Chorus]  
(Talk'n it out)  
Layin' in the cut  
Kissing and rubbin  
Makin' sweet lovin'  
Damn the club tonight  
Girl let's work it out  
(It'll be)  
Just me on you  
(All night)  
From eleven till  
Six in the morning  
I know you like when  
I do you like that  
Just work it out  
  
Now that I got you  
All soaking wet  
I bet you know  
What's coming next  
(You)  
Gonna twerk it out  
Ah baby  
Let me tell you how  
What do you think about me  
Twerkin' it from your  
Front to your back  
And kickback  
Relax come sit  
Here on my lap, shorty  
Tonight I'm takin' you  
All the way  
Won't stop until you  
Scream my name  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Morning is coming and  
I don't want to let you go  
Let's just lay her in this  
Bed of red rose pedals  
I know that we spent  
But one kiss  
Could make this start  
All over again  
If you want it baby  
Come with me  
  
It's way to trill the way  
You making it feel  
The way you twerkin' is  
Oh so sexy  
Oh baby, you sure  
Love the part  
It's way to trill the way  
You making it feel  
The way you twerkin is  
Oh so sexy  
Oh baby you sure  
Love the part  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Let me twerk it  
I won't hurt it  
Damn the club tonight girl  
Let's work it out  
Let me work it  
I won't hurt it  
I know you like when  
I do you like that  
Just work it out  
  
[Chorus until fade]
