Hey, California you don't know me, New York City you can't show me  
Anything I haven't seen at least a hundred times before  
I still love you, New Orleans, Mississippi River Queen  
?Cause when it comes to lovin' you beat all I've ever seen  
And I've seen a lot of ladies in my time  
I've had me a few women that were fine  
Ah, but I don't need no city woman messin' with my mind  
So goodbye San Francisco girl, I'm leavin' you behind  
And I've had some senoritas down in Mexico  
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho  
I've had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose  
If the good Lord made any better that you  
He's the only one who knows
