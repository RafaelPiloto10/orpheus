Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails  
He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells  
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico  
The only thing we've owned is this old house here by the road  
  
And when he dies he says he'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
She walked through springtime when I was home  
The days were sweet, our nights were warm  
The seasons changed, the jobs would come  
The flowers fade, and this old house felt so alone  
When the work took me away  
  
And when she dies she says she'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And she will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
Highway 90, the jobs are gone  
We kept our garden, we set the sun  
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow  
And once a year they come and go  
At this old house here by the road  
  
And when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
Yes when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away together  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
