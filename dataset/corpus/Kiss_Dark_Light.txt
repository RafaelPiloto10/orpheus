Look out, 'cause there's something wrong  
And you don't know what it is  
Watch out, or it's Sodom and Gomorrah  
The malevolent order  
Right now, before it's much too late  
Before it's much too late  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, the devil gets his due  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, is coming for you  
Now look up, well the skies are black  
And they're getting darker all the time  
Watch out, for the things that you believe in  
You're gonna be attacked,  
And you won't know what it is  
Wise up, you better watch your step  
You better watch your step  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, of perversion and hate  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, there's no time to wait  
Look out, for the death of love  
There will be no more love  
Watch out, it's yourself that you are fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Shout it out, it's a terrible thing  
Such a terrible thing  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, the sun is turning cool  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, is shining at you  
Dark light, dark light  
Is shining at you, dark light
