The tour bus came yesterday  
The driver's a mess today  
It's a dump of a destiny  
But it's got a view...  
Now the kid in the see-through blouse  
Is moving in hard on his holy vows...  
Since the preacher's not dead  
Dead drunk will have to do!  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets?  
The widow is dancing  
Down on the beach  
  
The starlight is steaming  
He'd like to be dreaming  
His senses are screaming  
Not to be denied...  
But if the spell of the night should win  
He could lose his bus  
For the same sweet sin  
That took his church from him  
Then how will he survive?  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets?  
It's the widow and her lover-boys  
Down on the beach  
  
The night is so fragrant  
These women so flagrant  
They could make him a vagrant  
With the flick of a shawl.  
The devil's in sweet sixteen  
The widow's good looking but she gets mean  
He's burning like Augustine  
With no help from God at all
