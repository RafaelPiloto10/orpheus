I'm a shy girl, my mother calls me flatchest,  
I'm a heavy boy, my father calls me a fathead,  
I'm a small guy, my friends call me an armrest,  
I'm a big girl, the boys call me a waterbed.  
  
I love all of me, I love all of me,  
I love all of me, I just wanna be.  
  
I'm a yellow girl, you choose to call me slanted eyes,  
I'm a white boy who fights for his roots and ties,  
I'm a red woman who cries over her child's hunger,  
I'm a black man who's come to terms with his anger.  
  
I love all of me, I love all of me,  
I love all of me, I just wanna be.  
  
I'm a nomad who writes his words in sand,  
I'm an aborigine who wishes to save his clan,  
I'm all people who cry for their land,  
People of the world walking hand in hand.  
  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of us,  
(I love all love me)  
We just wanna be.  
  
Live and let live, live and let live,  
Live and let live, live and let live  
  
"Phew, the cross we carry is so heavy.  
I wanna sit down for a second. do you mind?  
Not lie down, just sit down,  
Not too long, just so long.  
Hey! I got an I dare, can't we just burn the crosses instead of people?  
I happen to think that's healthy, and it's not blasphemy.  
So brush your wings, shine your rings,  
And we can sing.  
Are you ready?"  
  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of us,  
(I love all love me)  
We just wanna be.  
  
Once more!  
  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of me,  
(I love all love me)  
I love all of us,  
(I love all love me)  
We just wanna be.  
  
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
