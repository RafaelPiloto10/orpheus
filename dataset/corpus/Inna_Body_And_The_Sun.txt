[Verse:]  
It's a shame how winter came too soon  
Tried to love you but the love falls too  
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
You've been thinking 'bout me  
All the things that we've done  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
You've been thinking 'bout me  
We were nothing but fun  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun
