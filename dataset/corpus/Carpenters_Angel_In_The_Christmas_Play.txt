Poured the goldfish bowl into daddy's hat,  
Then I painted stripes on the family cat,  
Broke two teeth only yesterday,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
In department stores, do it "just because",  
Pull the whiskers off of the Santy Claus,  
I bite his leg and I run away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
Daddy laughs, he bends in half,  
When I wear angel hair,  
But wait until he takes a spill,  
My halo's on the stair.  
  
Well, I gotta go, before the mailman stops,  
And he feels that glue in the letter box,  
See you all when it's Christmas Day,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
Made a snowman holding a Christmas wreath,  
Used my grandpa's specs, and my grandma's teeth.  
Cut the hair off my dad's toupee,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
And in school today, brought a jar of ants,  
You should see my teacher do a dance.  
Hope she don't take my part away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
I put on my angel gown,  
And boy, did momma laugh,  
She didn't guess, it was her best dress,  
The one I cut in half.  
  
On the roof today, gave 'em all a scare,  
I put on my wings, tried to fly through the air.  
Hope that bump's gonna go away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.
