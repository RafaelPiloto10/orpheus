Hey Lordy mama  
I heard you wasn't feeling' good  
They're spreadin' dirty rumors  
All around the neighborhood  
They say you're mean and evil  
And don't know what to do  
That's the reason that he's gone  
And left you black and blue  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do now  
  
They say he's left you all alone  
To weather this old storm  
He's got another woman now  
Hangin' on his arm, yeah yeah yeah  
That old fool's tellin' everybody  
He's sick and tired of you  
Hey Lordy Lordy mama  
What you gonna do  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do  
  
They say you love to fuss and fight  
And bring a good man down  
And don't know how to treat him  
They say you ain't behind him  
And just don't understand  
And think that you're a woman  
But actin' like a man  
Hey Lordy mama  
What you gonna do now  
  
Get your nerves together, baby  
And set the record straight  
Set it straight  
Let the whole round world know  
It wasn't you  
That cause his bitter fate  
All these years you loved him  
And he knows it's true  
'Cause what you're wantin'  
For your man  
Is what he's wantin', too  
Hey yeah  
Tell me what you gonna do now  
  
When you love a man enough  
You're bound to disagree  
'Cause ain't nobody perfect  
'Cause ain't nobody free  
Hey Lordy mama  
Tell me what you gonna do  
What you gonna do
