If you'll only give me time  
All the heartache that he left behind  
Will fade from my mind  
I'll be free to love again  
  
If you'll only give me time  
I'll forget I even knew his name  
Forget that he came  
I'll be no good till I can  
Try to understand  
But when I'm sure I need him no more  
That's when I'll reach out for your hand  
  
So darling give me time  
And you will see that i'm  
Ready to love you  
Just as you love me  
Wait awhile  
'til I can find my smile  
And I'll be yours for as long as I live  
If you'll only give me time, yeah  
  
So darling give me time  
And you will see that i'm  
Ready to love you  
Just as you love me, oh  
Wait awhile  
'til I can find my smile  
And I'll be yours for as long as I live  
If you'll only give me time
