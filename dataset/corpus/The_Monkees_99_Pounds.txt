I tell ya she's a heart breaker  
And you can't tell me she ain't  
There's a little devil in her  
Under all that powder and paint  
And she can hang you up every night  
And get you so uptight  
She's ninety nine pounds, I said ninety nine pounds,  
She's ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
  
I tell you half a ton of sugar ain't half as sweet as her  
She can change and rearrange you  
Till you can't tell what you were  
And it don't even pay to fight  
'Cause she don't know wrong from right  
She's ninety nine pounds, I said ninety nine pounds,  
She's ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
  
And she may look like an angel  
But she's made out of TNT  
She's a little bitty thing and she ????  
Yeah but when she holds you tight  
She's some kind of outta sight  
She's ninety nine pounds, I said ninety nine pounds,  
I said ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
I said ninety nine pounds, I said ninety nine pounds,
