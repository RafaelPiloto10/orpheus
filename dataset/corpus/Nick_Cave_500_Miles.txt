If you miss the train I'm on  
Then you know that I'll be gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four  
Lord I'm 500 miles away from home  
500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles,  
Lord I'm 500 miles away from home  
  
Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name  
Lord I can't go-a-home this-a-way  
This-a-way, this-a-way, this-a-way, this-a-way,  
Lord I can't go-a-home this-a-way
