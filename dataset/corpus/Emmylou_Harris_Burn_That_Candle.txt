Keep that candle burnin' bright, mama  
I'll be kind of late tonight, mama  
There's a yellow moon above me, mama  
Shinin' on the one I love, mama  
  
[Chorus:]  
Burn that candle, night and day  
Burn that candle, honey light our way  
Keep that doorway open wide  
Until we come slowly strollin' side by side  
  
While that candle's shinin' high, mama  
I'll be with my sugar pie, mama  
We'll be comin' home you know and mama  
Lookin' for that candle glowin', mama  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After we have had the wedding, mama  
To that candle we'll be headin', mama  
So before we're winin' and dinin', mama  
Keep that candle light a-shinin', mama  
  
[Chorus x 2]
