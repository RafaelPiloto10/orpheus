Darkness falls  
Around your window pane  
A light still burns  
But just a smouldering flame  
Is it the end of another affair  
An open engagement with gloom  
Or will you be smiling  
When the sun conjures up  
A broken spell au clair de lune?  
  
Silhouette  
As you draw the shade  
Cloak of night  
You know it's tailor-made  
G-Plan gymnastics  
By an everglow fire  
Could never mean the same  
As summer enchantment  
By an old mill steam  
From courtly love to costly game  
Maybe I'm wrong for seeming  
Ungrateful, unforgiving  
Oh how it hurts now you're finally leaving  
I couldn't take anymore  
  
Now's the time!  
Let's hide away  
Sacred hours  
Saved from yesterday  
Boo-hoo willows weep around you still  
Mirror reflections of dew  
But waterfall pages of an open book  
Could shower new horizons soon  
Call the tune  
Will you swoon  
As I croon  
Your serenade
