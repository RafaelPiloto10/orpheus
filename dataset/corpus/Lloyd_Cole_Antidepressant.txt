I'm serving 12 to 15, working the coffee machine  
I've got a license to fly underneath the radar  
She's about 50 feet north, 'As Seen On TV' store  
I know she's gonna tune me in sooner or later  
With my medication, I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be, I will be fine  
I said, ?I'm trying to write my novel?  
She said, ?Neither am I?  
And either way I saw you reading 'No Depression'  
you're doing nothing, I?ll come over  
We?ll watch '6 Feet Under'  
And then we?ll maybe get around to your condition  
With my medication, I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be, I will be fine  
First she's gonna tire of my fixations  
Then she's gonna tire of my face  
I'm gonna need a new affectation  
I'm gonna need a new one everyday, everyday  
With my medication I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be fine  
With my medication, I will be, I will be fine
