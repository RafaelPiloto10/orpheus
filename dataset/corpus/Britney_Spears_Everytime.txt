Notice me  
Take my hand  
Why are we  
Strangers when  
Our love is strong  
Why carry on without me  
  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
It's haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I make-believe  
That you are here  
It's the only way  
That I see clear  
What have I done  
You seem to move on easy  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
You're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I may have made it rain  
Please forgive me  
My weakness caused you pain  
And this song's my sorry  
  
At night I pray  
That soon your face will fade away  
  
[Chorus]
