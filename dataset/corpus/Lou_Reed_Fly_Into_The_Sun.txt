I would not run from the holocaust  
I would not run from the bomb  
I'd welcome the chance to meet my maker  
And fly into the sun, fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into million pieces and fly into the sun  
  
I would not run from the blazing light  
I would not run from its rain  
I'd see it as an end to misery  
As an end to worldly pain  
An end to worldly pain ...  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
To end this worldly pain  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
And fly into the sun  
  
The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking  
The stars split to their core  
And every proton and unnamed neutron  
is fusing in my bones  
And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising  
As man burns from his tomb  
And I look at this as a blissful moment  
To fly into the sun  
  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd burn up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun  
To end this mystery answer my mystery  
I'd look at this as a wondrous moment  
To end this mystery  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun
