Send me 'cross the river  
Take me 'cross the ocean  
I just need to be somewhere  
To sort out my emotions  
You know it's up to you  
You know exactly what to do  
I can't take it anymore  
I don't want to come back  
  
[Chorus]  
Knocking on your door  
Down there on the floor  
I don't want to come back  
Knocking on your door  
Breaking every law  
I don't want to come back  
Knocking on your door  
  
Love to see me shiver  
You'd like to see me break down (break down)  
I've just got to hide my face  
Won't see your satisfaction  
You know it's down to you  
You know this thing i'm going through  
I can't take it anymore  
I don't want to come back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know it's up to you  
You know exactly what to do  
I can't take it anymore  
I don't want to come back  
  
[Chorus until fade]
