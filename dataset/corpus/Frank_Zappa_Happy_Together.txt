Say!  
Imagine me and you,  
I do,  
I think about you day and night  
It's only right,  
To think about the girl you love  
And hold her tight,  
So happy together  
If i should call you up,  
Invest a dime  
And you say you belong to me,  
And ease my mind  
Imagine how the world would be,  
So very fine,  
So happy together  
(just like a big rock-show)  
  
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  
When you're with me, baby,  
The skies will be blue for all my life  
(everybody sing along like a big rock-show, come on!)  
Babababababababababababababa...  
One more time!  
Babababababababababababababa...  
  
We'd like to thank you very much for comin' to our concert tonight  
I know that ah...in a way it's sad that bill graham is closin'  
Down the fillmore, but ah, i'm sure he'll get into somethin' better  
It's been lovely, workin' for you this evenin'  
Good night, good night, good night boys and girls!  
Good night, good night boys and girls, good night!
