Well a hard headed woman a soft hearted man  
Been the cause of trouble ever since the world began  
Oh yeah ever since the world began ah oh oh oh oh  
A hard headed woman is a thorn in the side of man  
Now Adam said to Eve listen here to me  
Don't you let me catch you messin' round that apple tree  
Oh yeah ever since the world began...  
  
[Guitar ]  
  
Now Samson told Delilah loud and clear  
Keep your cotton pickin' fingers out of my curly hair  
Oh yeah ever since the world began...  
  
[Piano ]  
  
Well I heard about a king who's doing swell  
Till he started playin' with that evil Jezabel  
Oh yeah ever since the world began...
