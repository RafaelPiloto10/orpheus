She walked her way down  
It brought my mind back  
From where I was trapped  
How long will it take  
For tension to break?  
  
Feel it sliding off  
Shimmy-like cloth  
I left on the ground  
  
And I know what the answer is  
And I'm happy to be here tonight  
  
But when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
Before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
And the drummer's counting out the start  
She walked her way down  
  
In silver and black  
The tension is snapped  
I picked up the trace  
A scent I can't place  
Remembering desire  
Higher and higher  
Lift off the ground  
  
And I know what the answer is  
But I'm happy to be here tonight  
  
And when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
But before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
The drummer makes the same mistake, and my eyes are on the shape  
That is captured in the light  
All went quiet on the floor when she walked her way down  
  
As we happen to be here tonight  
But don't we make a beautiful sight  
  
And when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
But before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
If you're tamed by all the pressure, everything you want to become  
The drummer always comes in late, and my eyes are on the shape  
That is captured in the light  
  
And I want to feel the weightless grasp upon my heavy life  
Yeah, uh, uh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh
