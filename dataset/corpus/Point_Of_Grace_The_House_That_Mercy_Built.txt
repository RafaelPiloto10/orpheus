A light in the distance  
Welcomes those wayfaring souls  
Come this far  
A heart grows tired, faith grows cold  
Wandering down the winding road  
Just simply knock, the door will open  
  
There is a house that mercy built  
There is a place where brokenness is healed  
There is a voice saying peace be still  
There is a house that mercy built  
  
Mercy will find you  
Though you've given up  
In the middle of what seems like nowhere  
He'll shelter you beneath his wing  
His love will cover every need  
Just simply seek and you will find  
  
There is a house that mercy built  
There is a place where emptiness is filled  
There is a voice saying peace be still  
There is a house that mercy built  
  
There is a house that mercy built  
With blood and tears  
We've nothing left to fear  
We live in grace  
Here in the safe embrace of god  
The mercy of god  
  
There is a house that mercy built  
There is a place where grace has  
Been revealed  
There is a voice saying peace be still  
There is a house that mercy built  
Rest in the hope  
Rest in the peace  
There is a house that mercy built
