Just got home from Illinois locked the front door oh boy!  
Got to sit down take a rest on the porch  
Imagination sets in pretty soon I'm singin'  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
There's a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearin' high heels  
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?  
Doo, doo doo  
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?  
Doo, doo doo  
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrow  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy!  
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrow  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door
