Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me,  
My lover stands on golden sands,  
And watches the ships that go sailing.  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
She's there watching for me,  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing.  
  
It's far beyond a star,  
It's near beyond the moon.  
And beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon.  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore,  
We'll kiss just as before,  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea,  
And never again I'll go sailing
