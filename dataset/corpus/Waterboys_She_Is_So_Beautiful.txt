She is so beautiful  
I've got no words to describe  
The way she makes me feel inside  
I'm flying solo  
  
As free as light as a bird  
yet I could lay my wings down in a moment  
To guard and comfort her  
She is so beautiful  
  
light-filled, loving and wise  
Laughter dancing in her eyes  
All my road is before me  
And I never did plan on a wife  
  
Yet she's the most beautiful soul  
I ever have met in this life  
For she is like a song  
She is like a ray of light  
  
She is like children praying  
Like harps and bells and cymbals playing  
And she is like a wind  
Moving, soothing, bringing joy  
  
And here am I, destroyed  
She is so beautiful  
I don't know what I'm going to do when I leave  
Except grieve
