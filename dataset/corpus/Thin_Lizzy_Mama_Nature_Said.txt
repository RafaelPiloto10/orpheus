Mama Nature said  
"It's murder what you've done"  
I sent you forth my brightest world  
Now it's nearly gone  
  
Birds and bees  
Been telling me  
You can't see  
The forest for the trees  
  
You cover up your lies  
With sympathies  
And I got no solutions  
To your persecution  
  
Mama Nature said  
"I can't believe it's true"  
I gave you life and food for thought  
Look what did you do  
  
You're killing my rivers  
Drowning my baby streams  
Day by day by day by day  
I hear them scream  
  
I'm so disillusioned  
I'm so disillusioned  
  
Mama Nature said  
"You're guilty of this crime"  
Now it's not just a matter of fact  
But just a matter of time  
  
Cruel will be the vengeance  
So savage is the deed that's done  
And I've got no solutions  
To your own pollutions
