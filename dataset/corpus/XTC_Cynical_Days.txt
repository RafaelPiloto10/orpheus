Another year's gone by,  
The world's grown older,  
Sometimes I heave a sigh,  
People grow colder.  
  
Every day I do my best to show,  
I can make it in this world I know,  
But all the bad thoughts that people bring,  
My faith in human nature's  
Getting pretty thin.  
  
Help me get through these cynical days.  
Help me get through my cynical ways.  
You say it's just a passing phase,  
You've got to help me get through, these cynical days.  
  
Another see through scheme,  
People are shallow.  
The dark night's closing in,  
My dark thoughts follow.  
  
I try and make my world a better place,  
(my efforts seem in vain),  
But I'm competing in a human race,  
(falling deeper down the drain),  
That value things that just don't count,  
Makes me wonder what it's all about.  
  
Help me get through these cynical days.  
Help me get through my cynical ways.  
You say it's just a passing phase,  
You've got to help me get through these cynical days.  
  
Yeah, you say it's just a passing phase,  
You've got to help me get through these cynical days.  
  
Yeah, you say it's just a passing phase,  
You've got to help me get through these cynical days.  
  
Yeah, you say it's just a passing phase,  
You've got to help me get through these cynical days.  
  
Cynical days.  
Cynical days.
