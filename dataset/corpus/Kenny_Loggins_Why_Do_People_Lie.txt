Why do people lie?  
Lying only breaks their hearts  
And tears their lives apart  
Making them cry  
Tell me why  
  
Even if I try  
Even if I lie to little babe  
I know she'll never leave me  
She'll stay by my side  
  
Tell me why do the people say  
She ain't loving you anyway  
So while you keep believing it brother  
She'll keep making her time  
Right before your eyes  
Tell me why they gotta lie  
  
[Chorus x2]  
When I looked I had to look again  
In my eyes a revelation  
In her arms the fascination  
Of a friend  
  
Now I let them know  
When people say I told you so  
I say, learning don't come easy, baby  
I've been making like a fool  
  
Tell me why  
Why is it true?  
Why?  
Tell me why do people lie?  
  
Tell me why  
Why do they lie?  
Oh, why do they lie?  
Tell me, tell me why  
  
Why do people lie to me  
Somebody here is lying to me  
I just don't know whether to believe them  
Whether to give them an account  
To form a doubt, don't want to be counted out  
  
Follow your heart babe  
Follow your heart yeah  
Follow your heart right on  
Follow your heart
