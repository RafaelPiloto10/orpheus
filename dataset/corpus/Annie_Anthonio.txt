Oh Anthonio,  
It's been nearly one year since  
Our Rio  
Nights of forever  
Pictures of you and me  
Dancing and memories  
  
Through the masquerade  
You led me by the hand  
Whispered the words  
"This Is Forever"  
Said from the silver tongue  
Thats where it started from  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?  
Did you even know my name?  
Did you ever really care?  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Do you ever wonder why,  
Or where I am now?  
Do you ever feel ashamed?  
Do you even feel a thing?  
  
Oh  
  
There I was under stars  
Hearts made in the sand  
Lying from the boy  
From Ipanema  
Tide comes rushing in  
Time and time again  
  
Now that summer has gone  
Where did you run?  
All my letters are  
Returned to sender  
For eternity  
You're a part of me  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?  
Did you even know my name?  
Did you ever really care?  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Do you ever wonder why,  
Or where I am now?  
Do you ever feel ashamed?  
Do you even feel a thing?  
  
Oh  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
You got everything you ever wanted from me,  
I was just another girl  
It was just another night  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
There is only one thing,  
That I'm trying to say  
It may come as a suprise  
My baby has your eyes.
