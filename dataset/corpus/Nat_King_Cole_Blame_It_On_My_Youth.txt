If I expected love when first we kissed  
Blame it on my youth  
If only just for you I did exist  
Blame it on my youth  
  
I believed in everything  
Like a child at three  
You meant more than anything  
All the world to me  
  
If you were on my mind all night and day  
Blame it on my youth  
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray  
Blame it on my youth  
  
If I cried a little bit  
When first I learned the truth  
Don't blame it on my heart  
Blame it on my youth  
  
If you were on my mind all night and day  
Blame it on my youth  
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray  
Blame it on my youth  
  
If I cried a little bit  
When first I learned the truth  
Don't blame it on my heart  
Blame it on my youth
