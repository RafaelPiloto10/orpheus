I've traveled all around the world  
And there are places that still stand out to me  
But nowhere else can quite compare  
To my island in the sea  
  
My personal utopia a place to run to  
Where I can hide away  
Where I can truly reign supreme  
somewhere fresh and clean  
Where a man can dream  
  
Chorus  
I'm king, king of somewhere hot  
(Don'tcha know)  
I'm king like every man should be  
I'm king, king of somewhere hot  
(Way to go)  
Where the music in my soul  
makes me start to lose control  
I could melt right on the spot  
I'm king of somewhere hot  
  
Someday I hope to find my queen  
I know she'll come my way  
I'll give her all my love  
It's not a complicated thing  
just a place where I can swing  
Where a man can be a king  
  
Chorus  
I'm king, king of somewhere hot  
(Don't cha know)  
I'm king like every man should be  
I'm king, king of somewhere hot  
(Way to go)  
O don't care how hard you look  
you won't find me in the book  
I could melt right on the spot  
I'm the king of somewhere hot
