In my fantasy, I'm a pantomime  
I'll just move my hands and everyone sees what I mean  
Words are too messy  
And it's way past time  
To end in my mouth  
  
Paint my face white and tried  
Reinvent the sea one wave at a time  
Speak without my voice  
And see the world by candlelight  
  
I ain't afraid to let it out  
I'm not afraid to take that fall  
But I have found beyond all doubt  
We say more by saying nothing at all  
  
In my fantasy, no such thing as time  
Minutes bleed into days, avant garde  
Show me your heresies  
And I'll show you mine  
We only speak in pantomimes on this carpet ride  
  
I ain't afraid to let it out  
I'm not afraid to take that fall  
But I have found beyond all doubt'  
We say more by saying nothing at all  
  
In my fantasy, you look good entwined  
In my hair and skin and spit and sweat and spilled red wine  
You're my deep secret, I'm your pantomime  
I'll just move my hands I promise you'll see what I mean
