Love me or leave me and let me be lonely  
You won't believe me but I love you only  
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else  
  
You might find the night time the right time for kissing  
Night time is my time for just reminiscing  
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else  
  
There'll be no one unless that someone is you  
I intended to be independently blue  
  
I want you love, don't wanna borrow  
Have it today to give back tomorrow  
Your love is my love  
There's no love for nobody else  
  
Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely  
You won't believe me but I love you only  
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else  
  
You might find the night time the right time for kissing  
Night time is my time for just reminiscing  
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else  
  
There'll be no one unless that someone is you  
I intended to be independently blue  
  
Say I want your love, don't wanna borrow  
Have it today to give back tomorrow  
Your love is my love  
My love is your love  
There's no love for nobody else
