I take my life one day at a time  
So many dreams that come and go in my mind  
Is this a new beginning a time when fools are winning  
Everybody needs something to believe  
The world we see is changing so fast  
No guarantees how long does a feeling last  
One look can tell a story  
My future's waiting for me  
Let it be with you make it all come true  
And find me a family  
Somewhere to go where I can belong  
That special place that I can call my home  
You know I'm gonna find it someday  
Please let me stay  
Find me a family  
I gotta know that somebody cares  
I need a chance I got so much to give  
If you can find me a family  
Find me a family  
I live and hope and whisper a prayer  
When I come home that you will be waiting there  
It's just a breath away and all you have to say  
Is stay with me tonight  
You know it sounds so right  
chorus  
Find me a family x6
