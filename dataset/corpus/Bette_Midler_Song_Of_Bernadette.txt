There was a child named Bernadette.  
I heard the story long ago.  
She saw the queen of heaven once  
And kept the vision in her soul.  
  
No one believed what she had seen.  
No one believed what she heard,  
That there were sorrows to be healed  
And mercy, mercy in this world.  
  
So many hearts I find  
Broke like yours and mine,  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo.  
I just want to hold you.  
Come on, let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do.  
  
We've been around, we fall, we fly.  
We mostly fall, we mostly run.  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that we've done.  
  
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest.  
I've got this joy here, here inside my breast.  
To think that I did not forget  
That child, that song of Bernadette.  
  
So many hearts I find,  
Hearts like yours and mine,  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo.  
Well, I just want to hold you.  
Come on, let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do.  
  
I just want to hold you.  
Won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do?
