Who are you with, where have you been  
Imagination turns thoughts, reason can't change  
Staring at the walls, think I know what I see  
Anger and coffee, feeling mean  
Drinking black coffee, black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring at the
wall  
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring at the...  
Stab through my heart, stab through my heart, stab through my heart  
But its all in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Just in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Its just in my mind, yeaaaaaaaaa  
My heart is pounding, as stare at the wall  
Its my turn to be jealous, now I don't stand for it all  
In fact I'm pretty stupid, I'm feeling small  
Anger and coffee, feeling mean  
Drinking black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring at the...  
Stab through my heart, stab through my heart, stab through my heart  
But its all in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Just in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Its just in my mind  
Yeaaaaaaaa  
Drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring
at the wall  
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring at the...  
Stab through my heart, stab through my heart, stab through my heart  
But its all in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Just in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Its just in my mind, yea  
If the night goes on, paranoia adultery  
Why should I be so stupid, when I can't really see  
The other side of the wall, is eating away at me  
Anger and Coffee, feeling mean  
Drinking black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee, staring at the wall  
Black coffee, drinking black coffee, drinking black coffee, staring at the...  
Stab through my heart, stab through my heart, stab through my heart  
But its all in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Its just in my mind, mind, mind, mind  
Its just in my mind
