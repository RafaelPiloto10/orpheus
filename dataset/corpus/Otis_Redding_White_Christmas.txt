I, I'm dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas, y'all  
Just like the one that I used to know, oh  
Honey, it's where the treetop, treetop listen  
Little bitty, little bitty, little bitty children should  
  
They try to listen  
To hear, before the sleigh bells that are ringing  
through the snow  
  
I want to tell you one more time what I'm thinking about  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, yeah  
With every Christmas, call that I write you, oh now  
  
I want you to know  
May all your days, May all your days  
Be so very merry, merry and bright  
Darling I wished all of them  
  
One more thing  
And may all, all of your Christmases  
And be all, and be all of your Christmases  
  
Baby may your days, may your days  
Be so merry, merry, merry and bright  
Lord have mercy, I wished all of them honey  
And may all your Christmases  
  
Be so wide  
Dreaming of a white, dreaming of a white Christmas  
Dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas  
Baby, baby, oh I'm dreaming, dreaming of a white Christmas...
