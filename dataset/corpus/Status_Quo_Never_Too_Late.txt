The world is in a mess, it's finished more or less  
It doesn't really matter  
And it's never too late to change it  
It's never too late to change it  
  
Did you take a look? Any sort of look?  
I'm sure you would remember  
'Cause it wouldn't need much explaining  
'Cause it's never too late for changing  
  
The world is in a mess, and finished more or less  
It doesn't really matter  
And it's never too late to change it  
It's never too late to change it  
It's never too late for changing  
Never too late for changing  
  
Now this old sea dog's gonna get away 'cross the water  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
  
But now it's getting late, too late to hesitate  
I can't wait any longer  
So there's no use in you complaining  
''cause it's never too late for changing  
  
Did you take a look? Any sort of look?  
I'm sure you would remember  
'Cause it wouldn't need much explaining  
'Cause it's never too late for changing  
  
I've told you once or twice it could be paradise  
So listen when I'm talking to you  
Shouldn't take much explaining  
The world is gonna need some changes  
Never too late to change it, never too late for changing  
Never too late to change it, never too late for changing  
  
Now this old sea dog's gonna get away 'cross the water  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye
