What's wrong? What are you afraid of?  
The Love Below  
  
She stays alone, never sheds a single tear  
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year  
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win  
She comes back to the cooler side of town  
but she lives in my lap  
  
[Chorus]  
She lives in my lap [Repeat: x6]  
Forever my fiance  
She lives in my lap  
Don't need no chain  
She lives in my lap  
I'll get the courage one day  
  
Make me want you, make me miss you  
make me wonder where you are, then forget you  
Girl remind me, just who we are  
We're oh so close, but yet so far  
  
Baby why are you acting like this?  
I don't care about any of them  
I care about you!  
Baby I Love you!  
  
You've got me open wide (I love you)  
Just Come inside (baby)  
It's yours (it's yours)  
I'm yours (I'm yours)  
For sure (for sure)  
Play baby play  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
