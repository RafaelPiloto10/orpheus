You got to learn how to fall  
Before you learn to fly  
And mama, mama it ain't no lie  
Before you learn to fly  
Learn how to fall  
  
You got to drift in the breeze  
Before you set your sails  
It's an occupation where the wind prevails  
Before you set your sails  
Drift in the breeze  
  
Oh and it's the same old story  
Ever since the world began  
Everybody got the runs for glory  
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan  
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan  
  
You got to learn how to fall  
Before you learn to fly  
The tank towns they tell no lie  
Before you learn to fly  
Learn how to fall
