Yeah ooh uh  
  
This one's for the mothers who have lost a child  
And this one's for the gypsies who've left their hearts behind  
This is for the strangers sleeping in my heart  
Who take what they want (yeah) and leave while it's still dark  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
All by themselves (all by themselves)  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved)  
  
This one's for the bridesmaid, never the bride  
This one's for the dreamers who lock their faith inside (who lock their faith
inside)  
And this is for the widows who think there's only one  
For the dying fathers who never told their sons  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
Follow your heart (follow your heart)  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry (one last cry)  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved (unloved)  
The unloved  
  
Oh tomorrow the sun will shine  
And dry the tears in your eyes  
Suddenly love comes alive  
Suddenly love comes alive  
  
For one last cry  
Just one last cry  
Ohh  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
This is a song for the unloved (loved)  
This is the music for one last cry (one last cry)  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
(This is this is)  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved  
Song for the unloved (the unloved)
