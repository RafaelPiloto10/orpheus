I'm sure I could make your hand fit mine  
If I deliver these custard trays on time  
Four-thirty A.M. ding-dong rise  
I kiss her photo with the beam from the ash tray light  
I'm sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended I'd never met her  
She said she'd love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Seven months in a ditch for the ring kept for her to decide  
If my milk truck's going to be her chariot ride  
Four-thirty A.M. ding-dong rise  
Morning sun makes my sour heart pasteurise  
I'm sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended I'd never met her  
She said she'd love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Welsh rarebit with a new dress on  
If that ain't enough to make you smile  
Every Kintail Road kid knows  
When she's around then cheese goes dry
