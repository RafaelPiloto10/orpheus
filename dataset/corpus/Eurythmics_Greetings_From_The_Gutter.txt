That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
Greetings from the gutter  
I've been here since yesterday  
Sweet dreams in the gutter  
All the skeletons come out to play  
At times I feel so logical inside  
So just give me the keys  
And I'll drive myself back home  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
I stand in the mirror counting the scars I let you see  
A little soft edged but bitter  
You're a star you don't talk to me  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over
