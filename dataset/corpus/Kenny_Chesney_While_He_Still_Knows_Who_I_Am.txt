Drive a Chevy 'cause he drove Chevys,  
Like him I'm a baseball fan  
I'm going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
Mama says he can't remember  
Daddy thinks that he still can  
I'm going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
This time I'm gonna hug him  
Instead of just shaking hands  
Gonna tell him that I love him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
I only knew him as my father,  
I'm gonna get to know the man  
I'm going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
This time I'm gonna kiss him  
Instead of just shaking hands  
Gonna tell him that I love him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
I know I can't turn back time  
We'll slow it down while we can  
I'm going home to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
While he still knows  
Who I am
