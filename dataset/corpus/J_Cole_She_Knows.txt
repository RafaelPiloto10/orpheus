She knows, she knows  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
You know I got a girl back home  
You got a man what you want, what you want  
What these bitches want from a nigga  
On some DMX shit  
I know them other niggas love tricking  
On some BMX shit  
But not me  
Now I'm sure you done heard about me  
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli  
Good southern bad hoes try me, they try me  
This is Martin Luther King in the club  
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch  
In his ear sayin' she down for whatever  
In the back of his mind is Coretta  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
I'm passing up on bad hoes  
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want  
What she want from a nigga  
To put a ring on it  
Got a bitch on my dick right now  
And she just want to sing on it  
Got me up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire  
'Cause I told her I was sleeping  
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose  
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
My niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Rest in peace to Aaliyah  
Rest in peace to Left Eye  
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya  
Just as soon as I die  
  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright
