You could have been more  
Than a name on the door  
On the thirty-third floor in the air  
More than a credit card  
Swimming pool in the backyard  
  
While you still have the time  
You could get away and find  
A better life, you know the grind Is so ungrateful  
Racing cars, whiskey bars  
No one cares who you really are  
You're the keeper of the cards  
Yes I know it gets hard  
Keeping the wheels turning  
And the wife she keeps the keys  
She is so pleased to be  
A part of the arrangement  
  
You could have been more  
Than a name on the door  
On the thirty-third floor in the air  
More than a consumer  
Lying in some roam trying to die  
More than a credit card  
Swimming pool in the backyard  
You could have been more than a name on the door  
You could have been more than a name on the door  
You could have been more  
You could have been more  
You could have been more
