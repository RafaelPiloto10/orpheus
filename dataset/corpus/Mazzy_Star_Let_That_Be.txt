I don't care if you're leavin' on the train  
I think all of your music's done in vain  
And I don't care about the girls that you lay  
I'm not the one who sees you anyway  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Won't you let that be  
I don't care if you're going home  
I think all of your music's done all wrong  
And I don't care if you live in misery  
Things apparent are the things you just can't see  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Won't you let that be
