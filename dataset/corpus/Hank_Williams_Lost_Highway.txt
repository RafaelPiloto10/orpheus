I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost  
For a life of sin I have paid the cost  
When I pass by all the people say  
Just another guy on the lost highway  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine  
O the day we met, I went astray  
I started rolling down that lost highway  
  
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two  
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you  
And now I'm lost, too late to pray  
Lord I paid the cost, on the lost highway  
  
Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round  
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound  
Take my advice or you'll curse the day  
You started rollin' down that lost highway
