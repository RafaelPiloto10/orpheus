Yes I am the dictator the more guns I got the better  
Yes I am the liquidator I carry the old Beretta  
You know there once was freedom  
You know how dangerous that can be  
The people used to dance and sing  
And they used to run wild in the streets  
But now I am the voice  
Howling from your radio  
From my armor plated Cadillac  
You'll hear what I say goes  
  
Yes I am the dictator I satisfy the U.S. team  
I always do my killing in the woods and keep the city gutters clean  
Cause I need a few more dollars  
For my fighter pilot to be free  
To dive bomb on the population  
If they go running wild in the streets  
Yes I am that voice, etc  
  
Yes I am the crusader I spent twenty years in exile  
But now I am the invader and I'm never never gonna die  
Yes I am the dictator my name is on your ballot sheet  
But until my box has your cross you know the form is incomplete  
And you know, etc
