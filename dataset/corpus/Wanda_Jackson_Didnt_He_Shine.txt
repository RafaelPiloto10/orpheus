To a world of fear and darkness came a light as bright as day  
With a song of love and words of kindness he came to show the way  
Oh his face was not recorded but the color of his skin  
But his words wrote down upon the darkness and touched the hearts of men  
  
All the people called him Jesus he was the man for all time  
Just a simple man called Jesus but didn't he love didn't he shine  
Let his light come brightly shining let it shine on you and me  
Let it wash away all fear and sorrow let it set us free  
All the people called him Jesus  
  
Didn't he shine didn't he shine didn't he shine  
Didn't he shine didn't he shine didn't he shine  
Didn't he shine didn't he shine didn't he shine
