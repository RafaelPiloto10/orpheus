As I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
These words could never say  
  
Like a fool I let my pride mislead me  
In this world I call myself a man  
But without your love to guide me  
Who could ease the pain inside me  
Somethin' only you could understand  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
'Cause I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
So I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
What I'm feeling now  
These words could never say  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
Oh, I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
There is so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
I've got so much love to give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
Please stay
