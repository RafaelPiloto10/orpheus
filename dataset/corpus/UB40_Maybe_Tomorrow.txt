I don't know how many stars there are  
Up in the heavenly sky  
I only know my heaven is here on earth  
Each time you look into my eyes  
The way you do baby  
Thank you, thank you baby  
  
My beautiful bird, you have flown away  
I held you too tight  
I can see  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
'Cause  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing  
(Gonna sing it to you)  
You are the 4 seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow  
You'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow  
You'll come back to my arms girl  
  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing  
(Gonna sing it to you)  
You are the 4 seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow  
You'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow  
You'll come back to my arms girl  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, yeah)  
You are the song that I sing  
(Sing it , sing it, sing it, yeah)  
You are the 4 seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow  
You'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow  
You'll come back to my arms girl  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing  
(Gonna sing it to you)  
You are the 4 seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow  
You'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow  
You'll come back to my arms girl
