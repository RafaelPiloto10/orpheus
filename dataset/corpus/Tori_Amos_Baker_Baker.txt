Baker baker baking a cake  
Make me a day  
Make me whole again  
And I wonder what's in a day  
What's in your cake this time  
  
I guess you heard he's gone to L.A.  
He says that behind my eyes I'm hiding  
And he tells me I pushed him away  
That my heart's been hard to find  
  
Here there must be something here  
There must be something here here  
  
Baker baker can you explain  
If truly his heart was made of icing  
And I wonder how mine would taste  
Maybe we could change his mind  
  
I know you're late for your next parade  
You came to make sure that I'm not running  
Well I ran from him in all kinds of ways  
Guess it was her turn this time  
  
Time  
Thought I'd make friends with time  
Thought we'd be flying  
Maybe not this time  
  
Baker baker baking a cake  
Make me a day  
Make me whole again  
And I wonder if he's ok  
If you see him say hi
