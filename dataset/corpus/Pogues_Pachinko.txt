I'm walking down Roppongi  
The night is hot and smoggy  
I drink a little coffee  
A sake and a beer  
I run into a ginja man  
He speaks but I don't understand  
He grins at me and takes my hand  
And whispers in my ear  
  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
In my pachinko dream  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
In my pachinko dream  
  
My senses all asunder  
I stand and stare in wonder  
There's bright light and there's thunder  
In pachinko land  
  
Well versed in the way of zen  
My pockets lined full of yen  
I walk the aisle and back again  
And sit at domo's hand  
  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
In my pachinko dream  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
In my pachinko dream  
  
I'm on the lexus fever  
My hand tight on the lever  
I'm shrieking like a diva  
Staring in a trance  
  
Turn the handle to the right  
A stream of silver balls in flight  
It screams and howls a blaze of light  
The earth moves below me  
I'm laughing tears of sheer delight  
As i go uchi domi  
  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
I play deji pachi  
In my pachinko dream  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
I go uchi domi  
In my pachinko dream
