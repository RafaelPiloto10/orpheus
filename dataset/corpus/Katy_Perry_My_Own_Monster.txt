I turn my head  
There's nothing there  
All I own is my thoughts  
For my fears  
I close the door  
To keep out the bad  
I plug my ears  
To keep out these fears  
  
And I cry  
  
So hold me close  
For I'm so tired  
Of holding myself  
So very tired  
And tired  
Tired and tired  
Just hold me  
(Repeat)  
  
I listen to these voices  
Or is it this house  
That's giving me chills,  
As I lie upon  
This little girls bed  
Who's at the door?  
Who's walking near?  
Or has  
My imagination spilled?  
This little girl  
All grown up still fears  
  
Oh and I cry  
  
Chorus(2x)  
  
Where can I go  
Where can I hide  
From these evil sufferings?  
Oh these images  
Painted on my walls  
They say there's a place  
That I can hide  
In the shadow of your wings  
Oh Lord, bring me  
To this place of refuge  
  
No more tears.  
  
Chorus(4x)
