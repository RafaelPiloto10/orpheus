Too bad we was thrown downstairs  
You never got a chance to sing  
We were quite polite  
With one invite  
To keep us off the street  
We mingled for a minute or two  
With the high class clientele  
And then somebody said who invited them  
That crowd of refugees  
  
What an insult to be shown the door  
Before we could shake a leg  
I was most intrigued by the colored queen  
Leaning on the kitchen door  
Then I was ushered with my friends  
By the butler who was twelve feet tall  
Well let me please explain  
That were not to blame  
We just don't have the right accent  
No, no  
  
All we wanted to do was to socialize  
Oh you know its a shame  
I was always getting the pain  
  
All we wanted to do was to socialize  
Oh you know its a shame  
How we always get the blame  
  
Twenty girls, damp hotels  
Is where I'm gonna stay  
Cause now I see what it's all about  
I didn't at the old school side  
Don't worry we had more fun  
Waiting for the all night bus  
Too bad my regional tongue  
Gave us away again
