I've got a brand new skillet and a brand new lid  
I ain't got no stove, but I'll bake my bread  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I'm gonna lock my doors, keep my windows all down  
You know about that, I want no bones around  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I ain't got no flour, I ain't got no meal  
If you got no man, you've got to rob and steal  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I'm might tell you somethin', don't know if I'm right  
But if you want my bread, you got to stay all night  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
Come here, come here, won't you come here now  
Boy, I ain't got time cause my bread ain't brown  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no
