I've had nothing but sorrow  
Since you said we were through  
There's no hope for tomorrow  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Every sweet thing that matters  
Has been broken in two  
All my dreams have been shattered  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Got no plans for next Sunday  
Got no plans for today  
Every day is blue Monday  
Every day you're away  
  
Though our pathways have parted  
To your memory I'm true  
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Do you wonder about me  
Like I'm hoping you do?  
Are you lonesome without me?  
Have you found someone new?  
  
Are you burning and yearning?  
Do you ever get blue?  
Do you think of returning?  
How's the world treating you?
