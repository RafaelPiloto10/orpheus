Away... Away  
  
I just can't wait to fall asleep  
I can't wait for night each day  
'Cause when the lights are low  
No matter where you go,  
You're only forty winks  
Away... Away  
  
No matter how far you may be,  
Believe me darling when I say,  
The oceans in between  
I cross them on a dream  
'Cause you're just forty winks  
Away... Away  
  
There's a land of enchantment  
Just beyond my pillowcase,  
And I go there 'cause I know there  
I'll be in your sweet embrace.  
  
So till you come back home again,  
Until you're in my arms to stay,  
It's kinda nice to know,  
I turn the lights down low,  
And you're just forty winks  
Away... Away...  
[Fade out]  
Away... Away
