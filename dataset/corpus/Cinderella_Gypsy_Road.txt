I used to be not what you see now, lord I try  
And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by  
Some fast talkin' mama goin down to put a smile on my face  
I'm drivin' all night  
I end up in the same old place  
  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I drive all night just to see the light  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright  
  
And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky  
I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by  
Some fast talkin' jerk wiped the smile off my face  
I'm drivin all night  
Just to keep the rat in the race  
  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I drive all night just to see the light  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright  
  
Sometimes I feel so old  
Got my lights burnin' bright  
But I'm lookin' pretty sold  
Sometimes I feel so cold  
So cold  
Lets go  
  
Got to get on home  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
My gypsy road can't take me home, t-t-take me  
  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I drive all night just to see the light  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright  
  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I drive all night just to see the light  
My gypsy road can't take me home  
I keep on p-p-pushin'  
My gypsy road  
My gypsy road  
My gypsy road  
My gypsy road  
My gypsy road
