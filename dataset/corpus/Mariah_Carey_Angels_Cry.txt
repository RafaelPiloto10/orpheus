I shouldn't have walked away  
I would've stayed if you'd say  
We could've made everything okay, but we just  
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport  
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground  
  
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall  
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor  
Super natural love conquers all, remember we  
Used to touch the sky  
And lighting don't strike  
The same place twice, when you and I,  
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry  
True love's a gift,  
But we let it drift in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
  
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?  
Bring it back and we gon' make it right  
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love  
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear  
In a whirlwind  
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling  
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow  
  
I know I can stand just pull me back up  
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us  
I'm willing to live and die for our love  
Baby, we can get back that shine  
  
'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice  
When you and I, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry  
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm  
Every night, I feel the angels cry  
  
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived  
Bring it back and we gon' make it right  
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (Don't let our love)  
We gotta ride it through,  
I'm reaching for you (Baby I'm missin' you)  
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (You can)  
We gotta ride it through, (We gotta ride it)  
I'm reaching for you (And I'm gonna say)  
  
Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice  
You and I, said goodbye, felt the angels cry  
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip, in a storm  
Every night, I feel the angels cry,  
Oh babe don't let the angels cry
