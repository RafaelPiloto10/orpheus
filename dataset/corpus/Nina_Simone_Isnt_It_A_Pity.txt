Isn't it a pity  
You don't know what I'm talking about yet  
But I'm gonna tell you soon  
It's a pity  
Isn't it a pity  
Isn't it a shame  
Yes, how we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to remember  
Just forgetting a note of thank you  
Isn't it a pity  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same  
We're all guilty  
Because all the tears  
Our eyes just can't hope to see  
But I don't think it's applicable to me  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Child, isn't it a pity  
How we take each other's love  
The most precious thing without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to keep open the door  
But I understand some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see, we're just the same  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
God, isn't it a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds us  
And we don't see it  
We think things are just the same  
We've been programmed that way  
Isn't it a pity  
If you want to feel sorry  
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a pity  
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us  
Because of all our tears  
Our eyes can't hope to see  
Maybe one day at least I'll see me  
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'  
And till that day mankind don't stand a chance  
Don't know nothin' about romance, everything is plastic  
Isn't it a pity  
My God
