All our mind's attention  
All our hearts affection  
Every heart-cry, every rhyme  
Everybody's worshipping something  
All our life's devotion  
Has been set in motion  
Religions dozen for a dime  
Everybody's worshipping something  
'Cause that's what we were made to do  
  
[Chorus]  
And I choose You  
All my attention, affection  
And all my devotion's for You  
If everybody's worshipping something  
I choose You  
You are beyond conception  
Defying definition  
And You knew me before time  
Centuries of pagans  
Idols fill the nations  
But You are Lord to me and mine  
Everybody's worshipping something  
'Cause that's what we were made to do...oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Before I chose You, You first chose me  
I worship You, You alone are worthy  
You alone deserve it-all of my worship  
Lord I choose You
