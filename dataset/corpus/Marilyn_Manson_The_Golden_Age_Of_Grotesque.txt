All our monkeys have monkeys  
We drive our death crush diamond jaguar limousines  
We're not fantastic motherfuckers,  
But we play them on TV.  
It's a dirty word Reich,  
Say what you like.  
It's a dirty word Reich,  
Say what you like.  
  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
  
The devils are girls with van goh's missing ear  
You say want you want but filth is all that they hear  
And I've got the jigger  
To make all of you bigger, so  
"ladies und gentlemen...drop your pissroom bait  
And make sure you're not late, you tramps and lunatics."  
Here's a trick that's gonna make you  
Click.  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
  
It's a dirty word Reich,  
Say what you like.  
It's a dirty word Reich,  
Say what you like.  
So my bon mots, hit-boy Tommy trons, rowdy rowdies,  
Honey-fingered goodbye dolls:  
"hellzapoppin, open your third nostril,  
Put on your black face and your god is gone."  
  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
We're the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
  
We sing...  
  
We sing...
