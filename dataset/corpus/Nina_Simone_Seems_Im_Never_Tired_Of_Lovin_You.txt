Darling, you always needed  
And your tenderness is needed too  
And it seems that I'm never tired  
Loving you, loving you  
Never was a feeling stronger  
Aching for the sweet things you do  
And it seems that I'm never tired loving you  
Should the mountains crumble to ashes  
And the rain should cease to fall  
And if the river stopped it's flowing  
You'd still be my all in all  
And if the clouds cover the sky  
So the sunlight won't come through  
Then I will never, never, never, never, never,  
Never, tire loving you
