Used to see him hanging around everywhere  
In a world of his own  
See him hanging round street corners where  
We would meet  
He was a lonely kid  
Now they tell us that he's moved on  
Aint been seen for so long  
Don't know here he's gone  
It's been so long, but I'm on the road  
And though it ain't been easy  
At least I made it on my own  
My tongue's been tied for far too long  
And now your gonna hear me  
At least I now where I belong  
S.O.L.O. I'm on the road  
Hello hello, I'm on my own  
Ah y'see everybody's got someone  
To lay their troubled lives upon  
I'm really glad I've only got my own  
Once upon a time, well I had lots of friends  
I moved freely through their lives  
But two's a couple and, well three's a crowd  
I was just left out  
Hanging around  
I've had as much now as I can take  
There ain't no need to stay  
S.O.L.O. I'm on the road  
Hello hello, I'm all alone  
Ah yes everybody smiles at me  
As I go walking by  
But I'm really glad I've only got my own  
S.O.L.O. I'm all alone  
S.O.L.O. I'm going down the road
