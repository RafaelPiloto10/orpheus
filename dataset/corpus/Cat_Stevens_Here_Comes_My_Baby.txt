In the midnight moonlight I'll be walking a long and lonely mile.  
And every time I do, I keep seeing this picture of you.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.  
  
You never walk alone, and you're forever talking on the phone.  
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.  
  
I'm still waiting for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna
start.  
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'til then this is all that I can say.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.
