Out of bed at 6:15 In a rush and you can't think  
Gotta catch the bus and train  
I'm in a rush and feelin' insane  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Go to work, it's such a drag  
Face the boss, he's such a nag  
In a suit and in a tie  
  
I look so late I wanna die  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
I punch the clock at 9:05  
I know I'm late, but still alive  
Everyone just stares at me  
(I'm last in line for this party)  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Five o'clock rolls around  
I feel so glad I kiss the ground  
Ain't enough hours in the day  
There's go to be a better way  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
