I know it's not like me to  
Hold back but this time I knew  
You must be silent to increase the volume  
  
In your head  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I'm the dictator  
The motivator shut up, shut up  
And do it to yourself  
I'm just an innocent bystander  
  
You left your own self in two  
Swear I had nothing to do  
With what's been done  
You know you can't but you can  
  
In your head  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Standing at the edge here  
Enough for me to have here  
Enough you see I miss you in my head fear  
So run when we'll never be clear  
  
Enough's enough [Repeat]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm just an innocent bystander [Repeat]
