Mmmm  
I love it when you play it like that  
Come on... Play  
  
Sittin' here alone I'm lookin' back on where I've roamed  
And laughing how I swore I'd win and not get burned  
Left my family  
Left my home  
I worked my fingers to the bone  
And there was not a stone I did not leave unturned  
And I was havin' a good time  
  
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster  
We're one day older and one step closer  
Roll on there's mountains to climb  
Roll on we're on borrowed time  
Roll on Roller coaster  
Roll on tonight  
Roll on tonight yeah  
  
Money and success  
I don't complain about the stress  
I wanted this and now it's here  
So I don't bitch  
And I swear that time's a trick  
It disappears in oh so quick  
Man I was just sixteen  
And now I'm starin' at thirty-six  
But I'm still havin' a good time  
  
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster  
We're one day older and one step closer  
Roll on there's mountains to climb  
Roll on we're on borrowed time  
Roll on Roller coaster  
Roll on tonight  
Roll on tonight  
  
And I know it's hard to see with the sun in your eyes  
But one day you're gonna say I saw the light  
  
And now headin' for the hill  
And I just cannot wait until  
My children grow up to have children of their own  
And I'll be telling them about  
The times I turned the party out  
And how I stood against an army all alone  
Drinkin' wine and stayin' high  
And realized it couldn't last  
And how I turned myself around  
And went down another path  
And the signs we must observe  
When life's changes do occur  
But most of all I'll tell them  
Just how proud I am of them  
And always have a good time  
It's all love and good times  
Let's all have a good time Yeah  
  
Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster  
We're one day older and one step closer  
Roll on there's mountains to climb  
Roll on we're on borrowed time  
Roll on Roller coaster  
Roll on tonight  
Roll on tonight
