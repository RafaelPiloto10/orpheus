I woke the same as any other day  
Except a voice was in my head  
It said seize the day, pull the trigger,  
Drop the blade  
And watch the rolling heads  
  
The day I tried to live  
I stole a thousand beggar's change  
And gave it to the rich  
  
The day I tried to win  
I dangled from the power lines  
And let the martyrs stretch  
Singing  
  
One more time around  
Might do it  
One more time around  
Might make it  
One more time around  
Might do it  
One more time around  
The day I tried to live  
  
Words you say never seem  
To live up to the ones  
Inside your head  
The lives we make  
Never seem to ever get us anywhere  
But dead  
  
The day I tried to live  
I wallowed in the blood and mud with  
All the other pigs  
  
I woke the same as any other day you know  
I should have stayed in bed  
  
The day I tried to win  
I walled in the blood and mud with  
All the other pigs  
  
And I learned that I was a liar  
Just like you
