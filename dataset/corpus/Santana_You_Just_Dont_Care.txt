I told you  
You'd have to leave  
And you listened with a cryin stare.  
Now you've got the nerve  
To tell me baby  
Yeah, yeah, a no, no  
You don't care  
You just don't care baby.  
Sun  
Turns back at the sight of you  
And your evil only clouds the air.  
  
You you just laugh at what you do.  
Hey, hey, hey, hum  
Now you don't care.  
Hey  
You don't care for me.  
  
Your feelings smashed  
Now you're leaving to find  
Someone who'll dare  
To change all the wrong  
Like you done to me  
Hey, hey, hey, no, no  
You don't care.  
Hey, hey, hey, you don't care.
