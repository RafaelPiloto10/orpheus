He needs me  
He doesn't know it, but he needs me  
And so no matter where he goes  
Though he doesn't care  
He knows that I'm here  
  
He needs me  
I ought to leave him, but he needs me  
I know that I ain't very bright  
Just to tag along  
Oh, but right or wrong  
I'm his and I'm here  
And I'm gonna be his friends or his lover  
  
Cause my one ambition is  
To wake him and make him discover  
That he needs me  
Ive got to follow where he leads me  
Or else hell never know that I need him  
Just as he needs me
