I could stay awake just to hear you breathing,  
Watch you smile while you are sleeping,  
While you're far away and dreaming,  
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,  
I could stay lost in this moment forever,  
When every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure.  
  
[Chorus]  
I Don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep,  
Cause I'd miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing,  
Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do,  
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing.  
  
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating,  
And I wonder what you're dreamin', wonderin' if its me you're seeing,  
And then I kiss you're eyes and thank God were together,  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't wanna miss one smile  
I don't wanna miss one kiss  
I just wanna be with you  
Right here with you, Just like this  
I just wanna hold you close  
And feel your heart so close to mine  
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time, yeah ah ah ah ah  
  
[Chorus: x3]
