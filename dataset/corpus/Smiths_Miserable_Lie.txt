So, goodbye  
Please stay with your own kind  
And I'll stay with mine  
  
There's something against us  
It's not time  
It's not time  
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
  
I know I need hardly say  
How much I love your casual way  
Oh, but please put your tongue away  
A little higher and we're well away  
The dark nights are drawing in  
And your humor is as black as them  
I look at yours, you laugh at mine  
And "love" is just a miserable lie  
You have destroyed my flower-like life  
Not once - twice  
You have corrupt my innocent mind  
Not once - twice  
I know the wind-swept mystical air  
It means : I'd like to see your underwear  
I recognize that mystical air  
It means : I'd like to seize your underwear  
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?  
Just a rented room in Whalley Range  
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?  
...Whalley Range !  
Into the depths of the criminal world  
I followed her ...  
  
I need advice, I need advice  
I need advice, I need advice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The world  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The world  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh, oh...  
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
I need advice, I need advice
