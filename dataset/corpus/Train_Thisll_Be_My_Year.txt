In eighty five  
Tuesday morning  
Came alive  
I didn't know you  
Route sixty six is gone  
And Reagan's here  
It won't be long  
  
Nintendo comes  
Live Aid too  
Back to the Future  
Where were you  
While I spent all my days  
In Catholic school?  
  
In eighty nine  
The dream begins  
First in line to California  
Pete Rose is banned for good  
The Simpsons come to Hollywood  
Russia leaves Afghanistan  
Flight one o three ends Pan Am  
Bush is here  
This is the year  
That I feel most alone  
  
No more  
Countin' down the hours  
No more  
Wishin' you were here  
I stopped believin'  
Although Journey told me don't  
Before I call it a day  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
  
In ninety two  
A boy is born  
The skies were blue  
In Ohio  
Boris Yeltsin chills  
Freddie dies  
But Queen is still  
Barcelona has the games  
Lady Di is single again  
Clinton wins  
And I still dream  
That I'll find you someday  
  
In ninety seven  
A baby girl  
Adds some heaven to the world  
Tony Blair tips the scales  
Elton sings for the Princess of Wales  
Microsoft buys into Mac  
My dad has a second heart attack  
And Train leaves San Francisco  
In a thousand-dollar van  
  
No more  
Countin' down the hours  
No more  
Wishin' you were here  
I stopped believin'  
Although Journey told me don't  
Before I call it a day  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
  
Two thousand and one  
The towers fell  
The World is stunned  
I wish I knew you  
I was on a plane  
The world would never be the same  
The artificial heart is born  
Ironic when New York's is torn out  
Woah-oah-oah-oah  
  
Two thousand and four  
Began in May  
On tour when I met you  
Facebook joins the Internet  
Oldsmobile joins the cassette  
I met your family  
It took a while until you kissed me  
But when you did  
I finally felt at home  
  
I stopped believin'  
Although Journey told me don't  
Before I call it a day  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
Maybe this'll be my year  
  
Two thousand and twelve  
And all I know  
Is everybody comes and goes  
Everybody sings and cries  
Makes the grade and takes the prize  
In somethin' nothin' I don't care  
Because I always know that you'll be here  
With me
