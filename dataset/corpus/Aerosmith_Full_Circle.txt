Yeah  
  
If I could change the world  
Like a fairy tale  
I would drink the love  
From your holy grail  
  
I would start with love  
Tell ol' Beelzebub  
To get outta town  
Cause you just lost your job  
  
How did we get so affected  
Cause I think  
Love is love reflected  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
And if  
There's a spell on you that  
I could take away  
I would do the deed  
Yeah, and by the way  
Here's to Heaven knows  
As the circle goes  
It ain't right  
I'm uptight  
Yeah, get on my toes!  
  
I used to think that every little thing I did was crazy  
But now I think the Karma cops are comin' after you  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
Every time you get yourself caught up  
Inside of someone else's crazy dream  
Own it, yeah, that's a mistake  
Everybody's gotta lot o' nada killing  
Them instead of killing me  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
Circle, circle...
