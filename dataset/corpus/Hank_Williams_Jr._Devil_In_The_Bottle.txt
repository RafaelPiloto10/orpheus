I Come Home Late At Night  
With My Boots In My Hand  
Stumble In The Back Door  
Being Quite As I Can  
And I Know She's There In Bed  
Cold And All Alone  
And She's Cryin'  
Because I'm Breaking Up Our Home  
  
[Chorus:]  
And She Knows  
The Hell I'm Going Through  
In This World  
Inside My Head  
There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
I Fall Into Her Arms  
And She Helps Me With My Clothes  
I Guess She Stays On With Me  
Because She Really Knows  
That I'm Tryin' Lord  
To Find My Freedom  
By Escaping To The Only  
Freedom I've Ever Known  
  
Repeat [Chorus:]  
  
Yes,There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
And It's Killing Her  
Watching Me Die This Way
