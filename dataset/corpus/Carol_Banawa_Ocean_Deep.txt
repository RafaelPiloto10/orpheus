Love can't you see I'm alone  
Can't you give this fool a chance  
A little love is all I ask - a little kindness  
In the night  
Please don't leave me behind  
don't tell me love is blind  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
  
Oh love I've been searching so long  
I've been searching high'n'low  
A little love is all I ask - a little sadness  
When you're gone  
Maybe you need a friend  
Only please don't let's pretend  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings - but I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls the pretty girls go sailing by  
  
Ocean deep - I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  
Maybe he has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep - ocean deep  
  
Love can't you hear when I call  
Can't you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feeling when we touch  
Why am I still alone?  
I've got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask - and that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings - but I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls and pretty girls go sailing by  
  
Ocean deep - I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  
Maybe he has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep - ocean deep  
  
I'm so lonely lonely lonely...  
Maybe..
