[Z-Ro]  
I'm sick of being lied to, giving it my all, you know I tried to  
Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to  
Do anything for my peeps  
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep  
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though  
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke  
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay  
In the mean time they hate you everyday  
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off  
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off  
When three's company and four is a crowd  
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around  
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges  
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it  
Got you looking at your people meaning shit  
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife  
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block  
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got  
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs  
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge  
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe  
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo  
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me  
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me  
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright  
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright  
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright  
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night  
Give me a split that's what I'm asking  
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing  
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me  
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love  
  
[Mr. 3-2]  
It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar  
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler  
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody  
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati  
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages  
Stacking big faces and travel to many places  
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon  
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?  
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right  
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight  
It's whenever when we were boss want to do  
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[H2O]  
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes  
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more  
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun  
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun  
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga  
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas  
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit  
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living  
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison  
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time  
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind  
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot  
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot  
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit  
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at  
  
[Chorus - 6x]
