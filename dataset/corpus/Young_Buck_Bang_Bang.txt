Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That aweful sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Don't nobody want to die, but everybody want to ball  
Somebody gotta go, when them killa's call  
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it  
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it  
The streets talk, the beats mark, 'cause that heat comin'  
And if they know that you did it, you better keep runnin'  
I think I see sumthin, there go my enemy  
Only lord knows where this nigga f'nd to be  
Tennakee, still the price is as real if you look it  
Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it  
Nigga anything goes, my shop never close  
From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo  
The real niggas feel me, the haters want to kill me  
But I'm holdin' down my city, me and this 9 milli  
While your throwin' bricks, and hidin' ya heads  
Homie, I know where you hang  
Ain't no thang to walk up and let that chopper go...  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That awefull sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangsta's pray  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Just think if I ain't empty the clip, and he killed me  
Would I still be livin'?, would my homeboy's miss me?  
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to?  
Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you  
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left  
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe  
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery  
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me  
I'd probably be in the penitentary  
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me  
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas  
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers  
Before I let this police kid harass me  
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me  
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed  
He made a move and I heard a blast  
That's what you get, bitch  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That awefull sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangsta's pray  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
It's goin down around here nigga  
Get ya muthafuckin head bust  
Them muthafuckin street lights go out  
And them real niggas come out  
All the bitch niggas go in the house  
Just not a game, man  
Don't fuck around and lose your brain  
And hey, all my real niggas pray  
  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me
