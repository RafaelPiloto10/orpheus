Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky.  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Maria's eyes.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
Well, you know about the sugar cane  
That comes from way down South.  
She's got one end in her hand,  
She's got one end in her mouth.  
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
She took me out walking  
To the corner of the world  
Where everyone was a-talking  
About such a pretty little girl.  
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky.  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Maria's eyes.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.
