There were barefoot dreams of catching outlaws  
There were school dreams of catching footballs  
There were young dreams of finding great romance  
There were armies and I took the chance  
There were avenues of glory and some deep despair  
That put subtle shapes of silver in my hair  
Well I'm forty now and I'm a man but I can't resist the urge to put dreams in
my plans  
So many hopeless dreams and I broke some vows  
Maybe life begins for me I'm forty now  
There were summer nights and there were good days life was water and I made
waves  
Oh I was crazy then so I made some breaks maybe God can look the other way  
Either good outweighs the bad or we forget the bad  
I'm thankful for a few friends that I've had  
Cause I'm forty now and I'm a man...  
Well I'm forty now
