I got my red shoes on  
Got my red gloves too  
Made my decision  
Gonna see this one through  
Too late, I can't stop now  
Open the door, I'll get through somehow  
  
Deep in my darkest night  
I always had a star that shone so bright  
Star of hope, shine on me  
I can take what comes my way  
Whatever goes down, whatever they say  
Star of hope shine on me  
  
'cause I'm ready  
Oh I'm ready  
  
Deep in my darkest night  
I always had a star that shone so bright  
Star of hope, shine on me  
I can take what comes my way  
Whatever goes down, whatever they say  
Star of hope shine on me  
  
'cause I'm ready  
Oh I'm ready
