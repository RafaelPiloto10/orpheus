We're just a stone's throw  
From burning hellfire  
Does anybody know  
Where did all the heroes go?  
  
We've had our fill of  
This gallery of scoundrels  
The leaders of the world  
Those power hungry liars  
  
Rise up and sound the sirens  
Send out the searching parties  
All we need is a few good men  
  
Send the S. O. S. And red alerts  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men?  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men?  
  
In some village far away  
Or in a little town pub  
High on a mountain top  
There must be an honest man  
Calling all honest men  
  
Throw out the tyrants  
The aged fat cats  
Outlived their usefulness  
They have led us to this mess  
  
Make them answer  
Hold them to their promises  
And throw them in the street  
If they won't tell the truth  
  
S. O. S. And red alert  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men  
(Calling all honest men)  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men?  
(Where's your honest men?)  
To your stations  
Man the ramparts  
The barricades  
  
We need new heroes urgently  
We need a few good honest men  
Calling all honest men  
Calling all honest men  
  
Call to him  
He lives next door  
Across the street  
On the upper floor  
It's our only hope we need him now  
  
Send the S. O. S. And red alert  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men  
(Calling all honest men)  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men  
(Where's your honest men?)  
  
Strike a blow, save the ship  
We need a few good honest men  
Calling all honest men  
Calling all honest men  
  
S. O. S. Across the universe  
Where's your honest  
We need your honest  
Calling all honest men  
  
Calling out all over the world  
(Sending out an S. O. S.)  
Where's your honest men  
Looking out all over the world  
(Sending out to save the world)  
We need your honest men  
  
Calling out all over the world  
(Sending out an S. O. S.)  
Where's your honest men  
Looking out all over the world  
(Sending out to save the world)  
We need your honest men  
  
Honest men, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
Save the world, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
  
Honest men, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
Save the world, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
  
Ooh, calling all honest men  
Ooh, calling all honest men
