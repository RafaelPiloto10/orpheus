Like bees with out the honey  
Or a sun that isn't sunny  
Eat a cookie without milk  
I wouldn't  
And it seems that you can't wear  
Just one shoe you need a pair  
Even if I wore them, Which I don't  
I couldn't  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky  
  
Every kind of game takes two  
I can't play without you  
I guess I better put my ball away now  
Even Bouncing is not as funny  
When you can't annoy your buddy  
I'd fix things  
If I just could figure out how  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky  
  
(Harmonica)  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same  
(Underneath the same sky)  
So good to know we're under the same sky  
(Underneath the same sky)  
(Underneath the same sky)  
  
Though my head is full of fluff  
This much I know is true  
It's lonely on my only  
Without you
