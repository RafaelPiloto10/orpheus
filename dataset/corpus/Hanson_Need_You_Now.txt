Your deep brown eyes  
They watch me as I sleep  
And long dark hair  
That washes over me  
  
Like a ray of sunlight  
That warms me as I wake  
'Cause I need you now  
  
Nothing ever goes the right way  
Got to live life day by day  
Hearts will bind you they're there to remind you of  
Where you stand  
  
A freckled nose  
That nudged me as I sleep  
A heart of gold  
That holds me as I dream  
  
Tucked away in silence  
But wake me when you come  
'Cause I need you now  
  
Nothing ever goes the right way  
Got to live life day by day  
Hearts will bind you they're there to remind you of  
Where you stand  
  
I'll never see you home  
'Cause then I'd sleep alone  
Each morning as I wake  
The sun is always brighter when you stay  
  
Oh Ooh
