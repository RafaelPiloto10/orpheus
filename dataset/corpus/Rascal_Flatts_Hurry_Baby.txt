I don't wanna wait, it's been too long  
I don't wanna lay here all alone  
I don't wanna need this phone  
To hear you breathe  
  
Every second feels just like a year  
Every moment you're not here  
Is like a lifetime of lonely  
Please  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Every single car that passes by  
My heart beats faster everytime  
I pray it's your headlights coming home  
If I could just speed up that clock  
I'd get you here then make it stop  
I'd wrap you in my arms  
And love you real slow  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Hurry baby, hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me  
Is got me goin' crazy
