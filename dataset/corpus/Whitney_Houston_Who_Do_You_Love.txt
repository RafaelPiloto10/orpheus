Who do you love do you love love love  
Who do you love do you love  
I got a feeling you're the boy for me  
I bet your love can set me free  
I feel a love thing going  
It started weak then got oh so strong  
  
Strong enough to rock the world  
Straight up I want to be your girl  
So I keep praying to the stars above  
That it's me who you're gonna love  
  
Am I the one (yeah)  
Is she the one  
Who do you love  
  
[Chorus]  
(Who) Who do you love  
I want to know  
Could it be me  
Won't you tell me so  
Who do you love  
You've got to say  
Don't want to go  
Why can't I stay  
  
I keep pushing so you'll be mine  
We'll be loving baby over time (heh)  
My sensitivity gets so high  
It keeps me dreaming that you're my guy  
  
Then I have to stop and check myself  
Could it be that you love someone else  
I can't give in to jealousy  
So touch me now if you love me Am I the one (ha ha ha come on now)  
Is she the one (make up your mind)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (who do you love huh)  
Is she the one (ow)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (am I the one)  
Is she the one (Is she the one)  
Who do you love  
Am I the one (I'm waiting)  
Is she the one (I'm waiting ha ha ha)  
Who do you love  
  
[Chorus]
