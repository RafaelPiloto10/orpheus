Enter the arena and hit the lights  
Step up now you're in for a ride  
this is war, ain't no fun and games  
we get it up, you go down in flames  
Party time, going down  
you better not mess us around  
the stakes are rich, take a hit or stay  
the price is high, someone's gonna pay  
Heads I win, tails you lose  
out of my way I'm coming through  
roll the dice don't think twice  
and we crush, Crush'em  
Looking for trouble, now you've found it  
you're a drum and we're gonna pound it  
Last one standing wins the fight  
hear us scream and shout all night  
down on the floor and eat the grit  
this is gonna hurt a little bit  
Heads I win, tails you lose  
out of my way I'm coming through  
roll the dice don't think twice  
and we crush, Crush'em  
Now we lay you down to rest  
you'll never be more than second best  
step inside you're in for a ride  
and we crush, Crush'em  
Don't need reason, don't want names  
just a John Doe to put to shame  
step aside let me explain  
the name of the game is pain  
Now we've found you  
We're gonna pound you  
We're gonna beat you  
Gonna defeat you  
We're gonna bust you  
We're gonna crush you  
We're gonna Crush'em
