(Go on!)  
He's romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
He'll be here  
Smiling on time  
He's romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
He'll be here  
Smiling on time  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladder's a planet  
Roy is a star, and  
I am a satellite  
(But that's alright)  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require (even longer)  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require (even longer)  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladder's a planet  
Roy is a star, and  
I am a satellite  
I will be set alight  
Don't say you'll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Don't say you'll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Oh...  
  
You're up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Foot in a bucket  
We trust you to wreck it  
Even when it's under your nose  
Well, you just can't  
See it, can you?  
Well, it's here  
Right under your nose  
And you just can't  
See it, can you?  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Oh...  
La la la la...
