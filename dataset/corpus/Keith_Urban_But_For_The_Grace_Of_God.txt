I can hear the neighbors  
They're arguin' again  
And there hasn't been peace on our street  
Since who knows when  
I don't mean to listen in  
But the shoutin' is so loud  
I turn up the radio to drown it out  
And silently I say a little prayer  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I must've been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I can see that old man  
He's walking past our door  
And I've been told that he's rich  
But he seems so poor  
'Cause no one comes to call on him  
And his phone it never rings  
He wanders through his empty home  
Surrounded by his things  
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I must've been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God yeah  
  
Ooo ooo I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God, yeah  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
