Met the girl I I love in a town way down in Dixie  
Beneath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl I ever did see  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the guitars played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Guitar  
  
All the world was bright as I held her on that night  
And I heard her-er say  
Please don't you go away  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the bagpipe played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Bagpipe  
  
Well I met the girl I I love in a town way down in Dixie  
Beneath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl I ever did see  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the fiddles played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Fiddle  
  
All the world wa-as bright as I held her on that night  
And I heard her-er say  
Please don't you go away  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while everybody played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Everybody  
  
Yes I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while everybody's playin'  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
  
Yes I held her in my arms, I told her of her many charms, and I  
Kissed her while everybody's playin'
