Busted flat in Baton Rouge waitin' for a train when I was feelin' near as
faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed the diesel down  
Just before it rained  
Rode us all the way to new orleans  
Well I pulled my harpoon, outta my dirty red bandanai's playing soft while
bobby sang the blues  
Windshield wipers slappin' time, i's holdin' bobby's hand and mine  
We sang ever song that driver knew  
Freedom's just another word, for nothin' left to lose  
Yeah, nothing, and I know, I know that it ain't free  
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, oh yeah, I really sang the blues  
You know feelin' good was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and my bobby mcgee  
From the ken-tucky coal mine, to the california sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my sole  
Through all kinds of weather  
Through everything that we had done  
Yeah bobby baby, kept me from the cold  
Now one day near salina, I let him slip away  
He's lookin' for that home that I hope he finds  
Yeah i'll trade all of my tomorrows, for one single yesterday  
To be holdin' bobby's body next to mine  
Yeah freedom's just another word, for nothin' left to lose  
Yeah, nothing, and I know, I know that it ain't free  
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, oh yeah, I really sang the blues  
You know feelin' good was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and my bobby mcgee  
La da da.....(fading out).....
