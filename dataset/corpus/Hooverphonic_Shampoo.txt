You're the shampoo in my eyes  
You are the salt in my wounds  
A necessity in life  
But always in the wrong place  
  
You're the thorn in my side  
You ache and ache and ache  
Still I can't live without  
You will be in me  
  
You're the warmth and the ice  
Not knowing what to do  
Should you laugh or should you cry  
You lead me to the wrong place  
  
You're the thorn in my side  
You ache and ache and ache  
Still I can't live without  
You will be in me
