There was a time  
When I was so brokenhearted  
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine  
The tables have turned - yeah  
'Cause me and them ways have parted  
That kinda love was the killin' kind  
All I want is someone I can't resist  
I know - all I - need to know  
By the way I got kissed  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dryin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do down on me  
Now there's not even breathing room  
Between pleasure and pain  
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love  
Must be one and the same  
It's down on me  
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing  
It's been on my mind, girl I gotta say  
We're partners in crime  
You got that certain something  
What you do to me takes my breath away  
Now the word out on the street  
Is the devil's in your kiss  
If our love goes up in flames  
That's a fire I can't resist  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do to me  
'Cause what you got inside  
Ain't where your love should stay  
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love  
'Til you give your heart away  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' just to let you  
Do what you do, what you do down on me  
Baby, baby, baby  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do down to, down to, down to  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery
