Jill, came tumbling down  
At the bottom of the hill  
Jack busted his crown  
Ah, my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my..  
I got to thinking  
Things aren't as good as they can be  
I got to drinking  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Tommy Prince, kissed a few there on the lips  
She woke him with a cold sore, she ain't so pretty no more  
Ah, my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my..  
I got to thinking  
I'm not as sweet as them all  
I got to drinking again  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
My fairytale love story  
Ooo, My fairytale love story  
Yeah, you're my fairytale love story  
Ooo, my fairytale love story  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Rapunzel let down your hair, I'll cut it off
