I will not be the one  
Who turns his back and runs  
When things get rocky down the line  
And I will not be the one  
Holdin' the smokin' gun  
If our love don't stand the test of time  
  
I'll love you forever  
I will be your man  
Beside you always  
I will stand  
  
I didn't say "I do"  
To take control of you  
I have no chains to hold you down  
If you'll let me spread my wings  
You'll get the best of me  
Deep in your heart is where I'm bound  
  
I will not forsake you  
I will take your hand  
Beside you always  
I will stand  
  
No matter what happens  
This feeling will stay  
Till the day that I die  
You'll fill up the heart of my soul  
That I'll take to the other side  
  
And you'll be the only one  
When all is said and done  
I'll keep you close to me I swear  
If ever you are down  
No need to look around  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
  
I'll love you forever  
I will be your man  
Beside you always  
I will stand
