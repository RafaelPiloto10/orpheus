Rockin' chair money  
Now I got rockin' chair money  
But I got it the hard, hard way  
I fought in every battle  
From the start to the VJ day  
Now I'll rock, yeah, rock  
Oh baby rock, rock on down the line  
Now some folks seem to be jealous  
Some don't seem to care  
But I got rockin' chair money, honey  
To rock on away from here  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
I rocked away out on the ocean  
I rocked from here and there  
My baby stepped out while I was gone  
Now she don't get my rockin' chair  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
I'll soon get my big check, baby  
And then we'll have some fun  
This rockin' chair money, honey  
Is better than totin' a gun  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line  
Now honey, let's go honky-tonkin'  
Let's honky-tonk all night  
Let's lolly gag and smooch and love  
And do it all upright  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line
