I''ve been missing you and  
I don't know what there is for me to do,  
But hope and wish and pray  
Love will find it's way from me to you one day  
And I would stay inside your world forever more  
  
There's no place to hide. I could never run,  
From what I feel inside.  
Seems all I have is you, and I want to make  
You love me deep and true.  
And if you do, I want to learn to be a part of you  
  
When there's no one to believe in  
My fantasies run wild.  
I make it easy on myself.  
I just dream of how the world would be  
If there were only you and me and no one else.  
  
I could easily believe in love 'cause  
You would never let me down.  
You bring such happiness to me  
And to prove how true my love would be,  
I'd hold you very high, for the world to see.  
  
I'll be missing you,  
And I don't know what there is for me to do,  
But I'll remember you.  
It seems I'm in the world alone with only you.  
For me to love, and to be loved  
There's only you  
There is only you
