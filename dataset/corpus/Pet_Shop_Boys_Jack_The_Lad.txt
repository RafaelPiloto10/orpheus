Oh oh  
Lawrence in the desert, how was he to know  
Under so much pressure from the men back home?  
  
Play with fire, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
Play with guns, you must be bad  
Or hiding something, Jack!  
  
Telling lies in public, breaking codes at home  
Underneath the blankets, for another role  
  
Tell these lies, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
To feast with panthers every night  
You must be careful, Jack!  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let them try to restrain you  
This is your only religion  
Don't let them try to detain you  
You're not the only fool  
We all fall, even Jack the Lad  
We all fall, even Jack the Lad  
  
Will fall  
  
Philby in the desert  
looking for a phone  
Waiting on the pavement  
for a call from home  
  
Play with fire, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
Turn your back on friends you had  
They must have hurt you, Jack!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Will fall
