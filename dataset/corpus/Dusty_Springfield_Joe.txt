(Hey, does anybody know)  
(How I can get in touch with Joe?)  
  
If I have to catch a subway  
Or catch a plane on a runway  
I've got to find out some way  
Where did he go?  
  
Yesterday was bright and sunny  
All his jokes were oh-so funny  
Now he's gone and left me  
Honey, where did you go?  
I've been searchin' here and there  
Lookin' for you everywhere  
'Cause your love I want to share  
  
Hey, does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?  
  
I will try to wait forever  
It could take till the twelfth of never  
How I pray we'd be together  
Where did he go?  
  
My heart was pure  
How could you bruise it?  
Gave him mine  
He just used it  
My mind was clear  
And he confused it  
Where did he go?  
I've been searchin' here and there  
Lookin' for you everywhere  
'Cause your love I want to share  
  
Hey does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?, ooh  
Does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?  
I can get in touch with Joe?, ooh Joey, Joey  
Somebody tell me  
Where did he go?, Joe  
Come back baby, Joe, oh, oh, Joey, Joey, Joey
