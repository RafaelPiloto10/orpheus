You don't know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Relying on rhetoric...  
Not well versed on topics...  
Any idea what you're talking about?  
Revisions of history  
Fair well in some company  
But don't shove that bullshit down my throat  
  
You don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
To find something to swear to...  
Till you don't know what's right from wrong  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Left suppresses right  
Right suppresses left  
So what's the left, and what's right?  
You're told what to wear,  
You're told what to like  
I'd be nice if you'd think for yourself sometime,  
But you don't.  
  
Now you don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
  
Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity  
You'll play it safe every time  
So life turns up empty  
And you're so dissatisfied  
Who are you blaming this time?  
Don't you know?
