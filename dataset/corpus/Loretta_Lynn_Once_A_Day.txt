When you found somebody new I thought I never would  
Forget you for I thought then I never could  
But time has taken all the pains away  
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day  
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn  
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long  
[ piano ]  
I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time  
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind  
She sat around and cried her life away  
Oh lucky me I'm only cryin' once a day  
Once a day all day long...  
Once a day every day all day long
