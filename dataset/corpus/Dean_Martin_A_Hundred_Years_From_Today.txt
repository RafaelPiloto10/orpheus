Don't save your kisses, just pass them around  
You'll find my reason is logically sound  
Who's gonna know that you passed them around  
A hundred years from today  
  
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen  
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green  
If you had millions, what would they all mean  
A hundred years from today  
  
So laugh and sing, make love the thing  
Be happy while you may  
There's always one, beneath the sun  
Who's bound to make you feel that way  
  
The moon is shinin' and that's a good sign  
Cling to me closer say you'll be mine  
Remember darlin', we won't see it shine  
A hundred years from today  
A hundred years from today  
  
The moon is shinin' and that's a good sign  
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine  
Remember darlin', we won't see it shine  
A hundred years from today  
A hundred years from today, today, today
