Hello mister, how you're doing?  
I didn't catch your name!  
No I'm not from here,  
I've just moved in, it's only been a few days.  
No, I don't mind, that could be fine,  
We could hang out some time, oh!  
But I gotta run now, hope to see you soon!  
Oh, oh!  
  
Bridge:  
Wake up in the morning, get that paper  
Walking on the hallway heading forward,  
And we pass by, and this is how  
He doesn't know what he does to my heart!  
Gotta catch him by the afternoon,  
If I miss him I don't know what I do,  
Yeah it might sound crazy, but it could be my baby!  
  
Chorus:  
I think I'm in love with the boy next door,  
Don't ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me,  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door!  
Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah!  
  
I check the man everyday  
But about the same time I know he's there!  
So I can catch a quick glimpse of his smile!  
Make it seem as a coincidence,  
I know I can see right through my eyes that I'm falling for him  
And that's no lie, no, no!

Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah!  
  
I get butterflies when he's around,  
And I can't help to wonder if he knows!  
But when I feel my... Sweaty,  
... Says let's go I'm ready,  
Can't remember having a crush like this before!  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
I think I'm in love with the boy next door,  
Don't ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door!  
Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah
