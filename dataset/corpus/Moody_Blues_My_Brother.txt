My brother  
If you could cast a little light on someone  
It's not too soon  
You took me halfway round the world  
I'm running out of time and reasons  
My true friend  
If you could tell me what it is that keeps you  
From coming down  
You left me way up in the clouds  
The higher you fly the less I see you  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean, an ocean  
My brother  
If you could take a little time to slow down  
It's more your style  
It takes a lifetime to decide  
I'm running out of time and reasons  
I'm running out, I'm running out  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean, an ocean
