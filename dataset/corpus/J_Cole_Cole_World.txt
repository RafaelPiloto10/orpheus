I think it's gonna be a hell of a night  
A hell of a night  
So we can do whatever you like  
Hey, hey  
  
It took me all day to find some inspiration  
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation  
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation  
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation  
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all  
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more  
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight  
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all  
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved  
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall  
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle  
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble  
Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary  
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae  
Told her I be dealin' with some real life shit  
She be askin' "when?", bitch! When I feel like it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cole World, Cole Life, Cold Blooded  
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it  
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me  
How that feel? Very happy!  
Hey  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
  
Uh, turn up the eight o eights for me  
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me  
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story  
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry  
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly  
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me  
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue  
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew  
See, when you're spittin' so real  
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal  
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal  
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell  
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' bout diplomacy  
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see  
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be  
I think they scared of me, and they should be  
  
[Chorus]
