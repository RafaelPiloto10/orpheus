I fished the everglades for a while  
Lookin' through the darkness at those alligators' eyes  
Three days in the sun boys ah it made me well  
But back in Nashville they're just a givin' me hell  
Singing (he's gone to hell in a basket) one of those hand woven caskets  
You got a deep question please don't ask it but I've gone to hell in a basket  
Them air boat boys have got their nerve  
Right now they're eatin' all of 'em terrible preserves  
Singing my new song for a six pack of beer back in Music City this is all you
can hear  
(He's gone to hell in a basket...  
Okefanokee ain't so much they say the grass ain't so tough  
These sawgrass neighbors know what life's all about  
Meanwhile back in Nashville they're still wearin' me out  
With (he's gone to hell in a basket...  
What you say (he's gone to hell in a basket...  
Yeah I know he's gone to hell in a basket...
