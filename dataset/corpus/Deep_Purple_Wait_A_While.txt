Wait before you go,  
So you will know, what I am feeling as you leave  
I understand, your need for some time  
Some solitude  
  
Wait a while, before you go  
You should know by now, my heart belongs to you  
  
I know that you must leave  
And I can see, that it's not easy for you, now that I'll be here, I know that
my soul  
Is always near you  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while For you  
  
The sand of time is slipping through my fingers  
You and I, still the memories linger on  
And on  
  
Now I know that if I can only let go  
And wait a while, you'll be here again with me  
The same old friends we've always been  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while  
Wait a while  
Wait a while  
For you
