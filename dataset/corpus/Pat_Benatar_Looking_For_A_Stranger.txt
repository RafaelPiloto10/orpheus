I had it with the same old routine  
I had it with the same old faces, places  
Every night, in my life  
I started feeling washed up, washed out  
Hung up, wrung out, left to dry out  
Every night  
But I know  
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere  
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight  
  
I'm tired of the same old  
"Hello baby, how ya doin'? Come here often?"  
Where have you been all my life?"  
Every night  
  
But I know  
That someday, somewhere  
I'll turn around and you'll be there  
Ooh...In my life  
Every night  
  
But I know  
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere  
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight  
  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight
