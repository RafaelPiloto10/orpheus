I stayed in town for a while  
Watching cars pass me by  
And I'm trying not to get too high  
But then I realized  
  
Is there only one direction  
Is there only right from wrong  
Got to make the right connection  
On my own  
  
I never said you would cry  
But I lied, now I lied  
Now he's crying just to get by  
Just to find, find out why  
  
There is only one direction  
There is only right from wrong  
Got to make the right connection  
On their own  
  
I stuck around for a while  
Watch the grass getting high  
And I try not to think for a while  
But then I had to smile  
  
'Cause there's only one direction  
Is there only one way home  
Got to make the right connection  
On their own
