Leave  
Me alone  
I won't pick  
Up the phone  
  
And I won't listen to messages  
Sent by someone who calls up and says:  
  
I don't like how  
You're living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
You're living a dream  
Don't you be a slob  
  
Leave  
Me again  
Don't hang out  
In my den  
  
Waiting for little clues to appear  
That I drank some of grandaddy's beer  
  
I don't like how  
You're living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
You're living a dream  
Don't you be a slob  
Slob  
Slob  
  
Waiting for little clues to appear  
That I drank some of grandaddy's beer  
  
I don't like how  
You're living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
You're living a dream  
Don't you be a slob  
Slob  
Slob  
Slob
