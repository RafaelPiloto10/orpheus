[Brian:]  
I won't tell nobody  
I'll just scream it in my mind  
Nothing good in life is scripted  
It's not like we predicted  
That the one you want  
Is gonna be the one you thought  
  
[Nick:]  
I won't tell nobody  
But I won't live like a prisoner  
Nothing has to be so perfect  
Can you tell me was it worth it  
Because her heart can't lie  
And even though her face may try  
Love can keep you up all night  
  
[Chorus (mainly Nick):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Brian:]  
If I don't tell a living soul  
Still everyone would know  
Yes they would  
It's always three am somewhere  
You know it when you get there  
  
[AJ:]  
Some people try to cover it up  
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)  
  
[Chorus (mainly AJ):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Nick:]  
I don't mean to scare you  
But everybody has a first time  
One day when you're old and gray  
Don't look back and never say  
You should have tried  
Stayed up all night  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
  
[AJ:]  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
  
[All:]  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
To the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[AJ:]  
Love will keep you up all night
