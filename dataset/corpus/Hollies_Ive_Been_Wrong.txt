I, I've been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So I'm telling your girl  
Stand by me my love  
And I'll give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And I'll give you everything  
And I'll give you everything  
Break  
Stand by me my love  
And I'll give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And I'll give you everything  
And I'll give you everything  
I, I've been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So I'm telling your girl  
Cry  
So I'm telling you girl  
Cry  
So I'm telling you girl  
Cry
