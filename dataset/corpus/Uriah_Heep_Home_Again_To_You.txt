Don't throw it all away  
Hear what I've gotta say  
Because you're always on my mind  
I've got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I don't want to waste my time  
So won't you hear my out  
Because it's all about when  
I come home again to you  
You're such a little child  
You're gonna drive me wild  
As I just don't know what to say  
I got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I don't want to get in your play  
Hesitate, because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
You make me feel so old  
Just like I have been told  
Because it's always up to you  
Oh baby, hear me out  
I've done all my time  
And I don't want to be misused  
So please don't hesitate  
Because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
Can't waste all my time  
Give me all today  
Well it's on my mind  
You can't own me  
When all I want to be  
But I don't want to waste all my time  
Hear me out  
Because I'll scream and out  
When I come home again to you  
Home to you ...
