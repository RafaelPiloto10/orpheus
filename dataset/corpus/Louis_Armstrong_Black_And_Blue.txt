Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead  
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
  
No joys for me, no company  
Even the mouse ran from my house  
All my life through I've been so black and blue  
  
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case  
Cause I can't hide what is on my face  
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn  
My heart is torn. Why was I born?  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
  
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case  
Cause I can't hide what is on my face  
How will it end? Ain't got a friend  
My only sin is in my skin  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
Tell me, what did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?  
What did I do to be so black and blue?
