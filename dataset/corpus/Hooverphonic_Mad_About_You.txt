Feel the vibe,  
Feel the terror,  
Feel the pain,  
It's driving me insane.  
I can't fake,  
For God's sake why am I driving in the wrong lane  
Trouble is my middle name.  
But in the end I'm not too bad  
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you  
  
Mad about you,  
Mad  
  
Are you the fishy wine that will give me a headache in the morning  
Or just a dark blue land mine that explode without a decent warning.  
Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bed,  
Into never seen passion, never seen passion  
That is why I am so mad about you  
  
Mad about you,  
Mad  
  
Trouble is your middle name.  
But at the end you're not too bad  
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you  
  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
  
Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bed,  
Into never seen passion, never seen passion  
That is why I am so mad about you  
  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you  
Mad about you
