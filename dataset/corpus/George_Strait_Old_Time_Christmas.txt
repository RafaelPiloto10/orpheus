Tricycles, Bicycles  
Candy canes and candlelight  
Tryin' to stay awake all night  
To catch a glimpse of Santa's reindeer  
Mama bakin', sister makin'  
Angels in the fallin' snow  
Now it seems so long ago  
I wish they all were here  
  
[Chorus]  
We'd have an old time Christmas  
An old time Christmas  
Just like the ones from yesterday  
We'd leave the world behind us  
Let the spirit find us  
And have an old time Christmas  
For old times sake  
  
Friends singin', bells ringin'  
Snowman standing in the yard  
It's a living Christmas card  
Captured in our hearts forever  
Friends scatter, it's won't matter  
The magic never melts away  
It only takes a Christmas Day  
To make it reappear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So leave the world behind you  
Let the spirit find you  
And have an old time Christmas  
For old times sake
