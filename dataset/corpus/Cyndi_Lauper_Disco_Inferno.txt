People getting loose now, getting down on the roof

(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno, yeah  
(Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down  
  
Satisfaction, it came in a chain reaction  
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct  
I tell ya', I tell ya' now, now...  
The heat was on, it was a rising to the top  
Well now, everybody's going strong, yeah that's when my spark got hot  
I heard somebody say
