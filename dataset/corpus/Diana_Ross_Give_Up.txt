Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
You better listen well  
When i tell you  
To be on the look out  
You can't call for help  
  
'Cause i know you inside out  
Despite all your hideouts  
I'm no great pretender  
I'll make you surrender  
  
So come along quietly  
Here's a thought to remember  
I have not met a man yet  
To escape from my drag-net  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
I'll give you just the facts man  
And you can draw all your own conclusions  
I'll keep your mind surrounded  
With chains of love so strong  
  
You can't break through them  
My arsenal is stocked  
With all kinds of seductive weapons  
Although your heart's locked up  
  
My love will assist me  
So that you can't resist me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
No, no, no  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me
