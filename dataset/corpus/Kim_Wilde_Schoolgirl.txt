It's something else to see the way you're growing  
From a sweet little baby to a grown up girl  
And I pray though darlin' I've no way to knowing  
That you'll discover a beautiful world  
As you skip down the street and hold your books so tightly  
Tell me what are you learning in your ABC  
Are you dreaming off all the many things you might be  
You know that we're just waiting to see  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world just waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
It's easy to worry in a world of trouble  
When there's nothing but bad news trying to bring you down  
But life doesn't have to be an uphill struggle  
There's still some wonderful things to be found  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world just waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
There is sadness and confusion in our hearts  
And the world prepares to fight  
As it tears itself apart, it isn't fair  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
Girl, you're really something, something to see  
You're little schoolgirl  
You're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
Little schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
Girl, you're really something, something to see
