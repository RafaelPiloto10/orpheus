[Featuring cool Nick]  
  
I'm in the studio with my brotha  
  
The half Asiatic  
  
You know the fraction of black skin and a smidget of white  
  
It's my brotha cool Nick  
  
And we about to drop some science on the this track  
  
About God and what not and the world...  
  
Step up and bow your head  
  
Be grateful your hungry for knowledge  
  
I'm serving a plate full of 12 course meals  
  
And a black plate of of wax through MC's  
  
Sit back and relax  
  
Try to digest the data that I feed you  
  
I'm actin' this way 'cause I'm bred to the color of my skin  
  
Something I take pride in  
  
Still my people insist on hidin' the American dream  
  
And it's like the home of the free  
  
And mom's apple pie  
  
I got whiped for the meltin' pod  
  
I guess not  
  
Kid stuck up for his rights and got shot  
  
Yah, I speak no evil 2X  
  
Yo, Nikc do me a favor  
  
Step up!  
  
[Kool Nick]  
  
His world is crazy  
  
It must be sick  
  
Be like Nick  
  
Get ricious real quick  
  
Jews, Muslims, Buddah Baptists  
  
Brought up like the Merry Christmas  
  
See salvation  
  
Every pinch of rhyme is from my heart  
  
And I meant this  
  
Jesus...Scattered his blood for me  
  
He hung on a cross  
  
You know that story  
  
Nowadays a lot of people are trying to worship Satan  
  
But your gonna fry in hell  
  
I'm never burning up the forcast  
  
No change in weather  
  
Damn the Devil would never twist this mind with the mark of the 666  
  
Thanks God there no one equal  
  
That's why I say no evil 2X  
  
Listen to the story of my savor  
  
And how he gave up life to let uslive  
  
That's a hell of a gift to give  
  
Kick it E  
  
Now as I take a look around  
  
I don't see many people down  
  
With my cars...Ha, that's scary  
  
Tryin' to diss the son of Marry  
  
You being lord take the bait  
  
And fall into the trap of Satan  
  
Then your life's over with no sequal  
  
That's why I speak no evil 2X  
  
Yo this is weird rhymin'  
  
Strange brothers are gettin' shaked on the streets with gold chains  
  
Some smoke crack, cocaine, and Jumbo fried  
  
When they talk mumbo  
  
How can this be society  
  
I front the place where none of us want to be  
  
People gettin' judged by the skin tone  
  
It wasn't like this way back with the Flinstones!  
  
Some times I get kept back because I'm half black  
  
People can't except that, YO except me for what I am  
  
What did I do  
  
Because noneof us give a damn  
  
All they want is to drive a Mercedes  
  
Half a million dollars...  
  
AND LIVE LIKE THE BRADY'S!!  
  
But anyways time is winding  
  
Not grinding  
  
Lok in your heart and start finding peace and love  
  
No matter what your grade is understand the knowledge at hand and  
  
Believe this  
  
I speak no evil!
