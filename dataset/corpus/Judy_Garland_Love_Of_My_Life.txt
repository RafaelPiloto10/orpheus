I lived in a dream my sweet  
In a dream of you  
My dream was a joy complete  
'Cause you loved me too...  
  
And I was no longer afraid of  
What the future might reveal  
For the stuff that dreams are made of  
Was suddenly real  
  
Love of my life  
Life of my love  
I used to pray  
And pray you'd hear me  
Love of my life  
Angels above  
Sent you at last  
To stay always near me  
  
Now we are one  
Never to part  
And evermore  
Need I implore you to miss me  
Come to my arms  
Come to my heart  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
  
Come to me  
Come... to me  
My... life  
My-why love...  
Love of my life  
My life  
My-why love...
