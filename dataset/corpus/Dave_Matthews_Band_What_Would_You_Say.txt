Up and down the puppies' hair  
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere  
'Cause of original sin  
  
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill  
And you came tumbling after  
'Cause of original sin  
  
Rip away the tears  
Drink a hope for happy years  
And you may find  
A lifetime's passed you by  
  
What would you say  
If you a monkey on a string  
If you a doggie on a chain  
What would you say  
  
I was there when the bear  
Ate his head, thought it was a candy  
Everyone goes in the end  
  
Knock knock on the door  
Who's it for, nobody in here  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
I don't understand at best  
I cannot speak for all the rest  
In the morning rise a lifetime's passed me by  
  
What would you say  
(don't' drop the big one)  
If you a monkey on a string  
(Don't cut my life line)  
If you a doggie on a chain  
(Don't bite the mailman)  
What would you say  
  
Every dog has it's day every day has it's way  
Of being forgotten- "Mom it's my birthday"  
  
What would you say  
(don't' drop the big one)  
If you a monkey on a string  
(Don't cut my life line)  
If you a doggie on a chain  
(Don't bite the mailman)  
What would you say
