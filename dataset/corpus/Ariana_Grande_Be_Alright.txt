[Verse 1]  
Midnight shadows  
When finding love is a battle  
But daylight, is so close  
So don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
  
[Refrain]  
Baby don't you know  
All of them tears gon' come and go  
Baby you just gotta make up your mind  
That every little thing is gonna be alright  
Baby don't you know  
All of them tears gon' come and go  
Baby you just gotta make up your mind  
We decided  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
  
[Verse 2]  
Babe we're in slow motion  
Can't seem to get where we're going  
But the high times are golden  
Cause they all lead to better days  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright  
  
[Refrain]  
Baby don't you know  
All of them tears gon' come and go  
Baby you just gotta make up your mind  
That every little thing is gonna be alright  
Baby don't you know  
All of them tears gon' come and go  
Baby you just gotta make up your mind  
We decided  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright, ooh baby  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright
