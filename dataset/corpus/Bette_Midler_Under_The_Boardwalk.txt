Oh, oh, the sun beats down  
And burns the tar up off the roof  
And your shoes get so hot  
You wish your tired feet were fireproof  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
From the park you hear  
Happy sounds from the carousel  
You can almost taste the hot dogs  
And french fries they sell  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
People walkin' above  
We'll be fallin' in love  
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk  
  
Oh, la la la la la la  
Oh, la la la la la la la la la  
Help me somebody, sing some la las with me  
Under the night, under the stars  
By the raging sea  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
People walkin', walkin'  
We'll be falling in love  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
Everybody walkin', walkin', walkin'  
We'll be under the boardwalk, boardwalk
