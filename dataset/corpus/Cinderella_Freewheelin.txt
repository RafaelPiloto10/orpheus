You say I get around but  
I'm gonna hit the ground  
I don't hear a word you're sayin'  
Going out of my head and  
The world's turnin' red  
Don't think I'll be stayin'  
You got your fancy pants now  
Wear 'em to the dance  
All I got is what I'm playin'  
But the trouble with you is there ain't just a few  
Don't take the ride unless you're payin'  
  
Like a hot burnin' fire  
Blazin' out of control  
I couldn't get much higher, I'm  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin' gets in my way  
When I'm freewheelin  
I'm free yea  
  
Take a look around cause it's all fallin' down  
Fallin' from the dream that we created  
I'm lookin' up at the sky and I'm wondering why  
Why it's all deflated  
You got a million and one ways to have fun  
Everything I've done is over-rated  
So take a step back cause I don't need the flack  
I can see your promises a fadin'  
  
Like a hot burnin' fire  
Blazin' out of control  
I couldn't get much higher, I'm  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin' gets in my way  
When I'm freewheelin  
I'm free yea  
  
Like a hot burnin' fire  
Blazin' out of control  
I couldn't get much higher, I'm  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothin' gets in my way  
When I'm freewheelin  
I'm free yea  
  
Freewheelin  
Nothing get in my way  
When I'm freewheelin  
I'm free yea  
  
Freewheelin  
When I'm freewheelin  
I'm free yea
