We must say good-bye  
There's no need for you to cry  
It's better that I tell you this tonight  
Our affair has been quite heated  
You thought I was what you needed  
But the time has come, my darlin'  
To set things right, 'cause  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
You been like a little angel  
How you loved me  
I appreciate the warmth of your embrace  
Well, the world don't need to know  
How I adored you  
But there's somethin' I must tell you, darlin'  
Face to face...  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
So it's adios, adios, my little darlin'  
(adios my little darlin'...)  
Gotta go now...  
Keep that hankie that I gave you for  
When you cry  
There are things that trouble me  
And I'm sure that you must see  
That it breaks my heart the same as yours  
When we say good-bye  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...
