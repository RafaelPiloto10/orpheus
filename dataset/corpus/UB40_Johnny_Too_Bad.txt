Walking down the road  
With a pistol in your waist  
Johnny you're too bad  
Walking down the road  
With a ratchet in your waist  
Johnny you're too bad  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just robbin' and stabbin'  
And lootin' and shooting'  
You're too bad (repeat)  
  
One of these day's  
When you hear a voice say come,  
Where you gonna run to?  
One of these day's  
When you hear a voice say come,  
Where you gonna run to?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're gonna run to the rock  
For rescue, there'll be no rock  
You're gonna run to the rock  
For rescue, there'll be no rock
