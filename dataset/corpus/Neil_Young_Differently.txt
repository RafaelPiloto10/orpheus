Wish you told me by and by,  
That my life would come to this,  
That I'd have to find a way  
to let things go,  
That my friends would turn to foes,  
And my love would come to blows,  
Then I would have done some things  
differently.  
  
Differently...  
I would ask you out every night.  
Differently...  
And I would make you feel so good.  
Differently...  
And appreciate the things that  
you bring to me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I would, oh yeah.  
  
Yeah, I know you tried and tried,  
But your signal I just missed,  
When you said my little girl  
would soon be gone,  
Yes I didn't hear you then,  
And it might be too late now,  
That's another thing I'd do  
differently.  
  
Differently...  
Like trying to make you feel  
loved every day.  
Differently...  
And saying little things to  
let you know how I feel.  
Differently...  
Yes I can hear your young  
voice calling me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can.  
  
When I 'm away I call you up,  
And you don't seem to miss me as much,  
But I know our love  
is still there in your heart,  
Just differently.  
  
Differently...  
Oh yes, I can hear your young  
voice calling me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can.  
Differently...  
I'd appreciate the things that you  
bring to me babe, yes I would.  
Differently...  
Oh come on back to me babe,  
bring your love back to me.  
Differently...  
Oh yeah I need your love,  
I need your love.  
Differently...  
Yes I can tell you babe,  
I need your love.  
Differently...  
Today is a brand new day, yes it is.  
Differently...  
Got to get your love back, babe,  
come on now bring it back to me.  
Differently...  
Turn it around babe, turn it  
around and bring it back.  
Differently...  
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, got to get  
your love back, come on babe.  
Differently...  
Yeah I can hear your young  
voice calling me babe.  
Differently...  
Come on back to me, come on back,  
yeah yeah, turn it around.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can, yes I can.  
Differently.
