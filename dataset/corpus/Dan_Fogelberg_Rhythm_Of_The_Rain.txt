[Chorus:]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
Now the only girl I've ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair  
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care  
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh the only girl I've ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
Rain won't you tell her that I love her so  
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow  
And rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
Oh I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
When the rain comes  
They run and hide their heads  
They might as well be dead  
When the rain comes
