We may be strangers  
We may be worlds apart somehow  
And it's hard to accept  
The things we just don't understand  
So blind to each other  
We only see one side of nowhere  
Some things we may never know  
If there's one thing you should ever know  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
Into this world  
We come with a heart that's open wide  
And the best of this life  
Is all I ever want for you  
The love you believe in, your every dream  
Your every passion  
In time I know you'll come to see  
Nothin' means as much to me  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
There'll come a time when you'll be on your own  
But in your heart you're never far from home  
Eery road you take  
Your ever living day  
You will always be, you will always be  
The soul of my soul  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
Some kind of miracle of my life that's what you are  
Blood of my blood, light of my life  
You mean much more than you know  
Soul of my soul
