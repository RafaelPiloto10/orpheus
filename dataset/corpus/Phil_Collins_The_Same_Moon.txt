When the daylight comes and I look across the room,  
I see you're gone.  
As the morning breaks and I reach to hold your hand  
I can see, see I'm the only one.  
Well, your clothes are gone and your bags are packed  
But the bed's still warm where you lay  
Now I need your love to come shining through  
To carry me, come carry me away.  
  
If you choose a time, I'll catch the moon  
I'll see you there  
From wherever I am, wherever you are  
We'll find somewhere.  
I see the same stars in the same sky  
Shining down on you,  
I'll be looking up from wherever I am  
And it's you I'll see if you're looking too.  
  
There'll be days that'll seem much longer,  
Some nights will seem so cold,  
And it's gotta come soon - please don't be too long,  
Don't be too long.  
  
If you choose a time, we can catch the moon  
I'll see you there  
Whenever it is, from wherever you are  
Oh we'll find, yes we'll find somewhere.  
Are you looking at the same moon?
