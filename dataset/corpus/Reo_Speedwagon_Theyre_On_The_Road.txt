It's the season of the golden leaves  
When the wind turns into a bitter breeze  
  
I was walking through the oak leaves on the hill  
With my lady, oh she's got a strong will  
And I see her through these ever-clouded eyes  
This time it's goodbye and I can't answer why  
  
Maybe it's because I ain't quite shy of running yet  
Or maybe it's because I'm the hometown boy in the spotlight  
But my roots ain't in the ground  
They're on the road  
  
Settle down was all I ever heard from her  
"If you cared," she said, "you would weigh my words"  
But my life doesn't ride on the factory road  
Baby, don't ask me why, I can't even pretend to know
