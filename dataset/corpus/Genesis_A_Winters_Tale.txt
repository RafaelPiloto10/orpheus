The winter's bitterness is lost  
It's the fireside warmth that comforts me  
The peace for all my thoughts  
  
The night brings shadows to the street  
It's the time for dreams of things to come  
To creep inside their lives  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, deep inside you  
Let me touch you, let me keep you  
Let me know you're there  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, no  
Yes deep inside you're a part of me  
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there  
  
The evening fantasy begins  
In the sandy lanes that cross the fields  
The gentle rain will fall  
  
The morning sweeps away the night  
And the dreams of you still haunt my thoughts  
Bring meaning to my life  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, deep inside you  
Let me touch you, let me keep you  
Let me know you're there  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, no  
Yes deep inside you're a part of me  
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there  
  
Can you hold me with your small hand  
Prepare much, length and beauty of our tiny lives  
Future's brighter now  
Our world is everything to me, to know, I'm there  
Lord! You see the world is brighter than the sky  
The sky is shining everywhere in our world  
You know you never said in your many times, all in me instead
