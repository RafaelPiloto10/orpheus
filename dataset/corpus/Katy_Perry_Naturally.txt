Did it seem  
To disappoint you  
Living alone?  
By the banks  
Of your dilemma  
Out of control  
No one seems  
To give the answers  
That you wanna hear  
What you'd give  
To find a welcome here  
  
Miles and miles of lies  
Behind you  
Those were the days  
So many lives  
You'd hope would guide you  
Help you find a way  
Now it seems to your surprise  
That they left you lying here  
What you'd give to dry  
These bitter tears  
  
Did it come naturally?  
You a million miles from home  
When you tried so carefully  
To live a life  
That's not your own  
Always remember  
That it wasn't that long ago  
I stilled the oceans  
I moved the mountains  
To say I love you  
  
Heaven waits  
The hours of silence  
Finds you on your knees  
Broken in a sweet surrender  
Of peace  
All the years of searching  
For a love you didn't know  
Now you've finally found  
A welcome home  
  
Chorus  
  
Music break  
  
Bridge:  
I love you, I have  
And I always will.  
  
Chorus (2x)
