Probably one of the nicest affections in the world  
Is that feeling that's there between  
A worldly old uncle and very innocent young niece  
  
Liza, won't you lay your head on my shoulder?  
Cry if you want to, I don't mind  
Seems as if you need some love and kindness  
And all I've got is time  
  
Wiser is the way when you grow older  
Nothing heals a broken heart but time  
I know what it means to need a shoulder  
So lay your head on mine
