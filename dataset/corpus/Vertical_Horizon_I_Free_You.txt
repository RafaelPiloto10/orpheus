A serenade is through, and all the fireworks, fade away  
A gathering is gone, so, no more holiday  
  
On the run (run), till we're done (done), away again  
Nothing left (left), out of breath (breath), we waste again  
It doesn't really matter, no, it doesn't anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just can't break through  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
  
Your sadder days are best, to remember, none of this  
Nobody comes around, to remind me, of what I miss  
  
Written down (down), on the ground (ground), away again  
Something wrong (wrong), now it's gone (gone), to waste again  
It doesn't really matter. no, it doesn't anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just can't break through  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
  
I hear it  
I hear it  
I hear it  
  
A frozen on the tracks, before the train, I hear it  
The bullet size, before the pain, I hear it  
Waiting for the flash, up in the sky, I hear it  
  
I take the fall into the light  
  
I held on  
To long  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
I free you (oh)  
I free you
