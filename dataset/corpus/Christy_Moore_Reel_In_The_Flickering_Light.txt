The Reel in the Flickering Light  
By Christy Moore  
  
As I was walking home one evenin'  
I know this takes some believin'  
I met a group of creatures  
With the strangest lookin' features  
  
A poor old dove and a worm in the weed  
And a fine old pigeon, yes indeed  
A daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
And the daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
  
On his thin and wispy spindles  
He was deft and he was nimble  
His eyes were scientific  
And his dancing was terrific  
  
And the rats and worms they made a din  
And the nettles in the corners took it in  
"Oh God" says I, "Tonight's the night"  
"We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light"  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
"Oh God" says I "tonight's the night  
We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light"  
  
Then he looked at me directly  
With a gaze that could dissect me  
Then he asked me in a whisper  
"Have you got any sisters?"  
  
"Oh God almighty" says I to him  
"What sort of a man d'you think I am?  
I've only one she's not your type  
She wouldn't dance the reel in the flickering light"  
So round we go, heel to the toe  
"I've only one she's not your type  
She wouldn't dance a reel in the flickering light"  
  
Says he:  
"Does she come from another planet?  
Does she got a bee in her bonnet?  
Does she do her daily duties  
You never know we might be suited"  
  
And the rats and the worms began in to laugh  
And some of them started shufflin' off  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
  
I could see he had no scruples  
When I looked into his pupils  
They were purple or magenta  
Like a statue during lent  
  
I said "I'll get her right away"  
"Good man" says he "now don't delay"  
We're going to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light.  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light.  
  
Then up stepped a red carnation  
and they gave her an ovation  
She was warm and enchatin'  
As she slowly started dancin'  
  
And the wise old pigeon peeled his eye.  
And the nettles and the weeds began to sigh.  
Daddy longlegs said "my-oh-my  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light? "  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
Daddy longlegs said "my-oh-my  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light? "  
  
She was gentle, she was charmin'  
And I heard him call her "darlin'  
He was graceful as a whisper  
On his delicate legs of silver  
  
And the rats and worms were still as mice  
And the poor old pigeon said "That's nice"  
As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light  
  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light
