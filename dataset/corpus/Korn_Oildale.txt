Look at you  
Feeling all good  
You can't resist  
You have to be all  
Up in it  
Don't it feel great  
Talking Shit  
I let it go.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
My heart is gonna break from the fall.  
Holding on to petty things.  
Feeling all the hate it brings.  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
  
What a puss  
Think you're so tough  
I take this shit  
All I had was  
Loving me  
It was so good  
But that wasn't enough  
You ripped it away  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
My heart is gonna break from the fall.  
Holding on to petty things.  
Feeling all the hate it brings.  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
  
All the disrespect  
Oh fuck, hypocrite  
All the bullshit you took from me  
Your such a piece of shit  
Nothing but a heretic  
Sucking the life out of me  
Fucker your gone without me  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
My heart is gonna break from the fall.  
Holding on to petty things.  
Feeling all the hate it brings.  
Why don't you just leave me alone.  
  
Leave me alone!  
Leave me alone!  
Leave me alone!  
Leave me the fuck alone!
