See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker  
Mama she left me and my papa was a hard trucker  
Out on the highway we loved to roll  
He never made me go to school  
  
I never begged to go  
I was a low class livin' raised out in the sticks  
I was born to be a hick  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin'  
  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin'  
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands  
People always tell me I'm a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
Ohh I was born to be a hick  
  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel hunter  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin  
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands  
People always tell me I'm a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
See I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'm a shotgun tokin'  
I'm a John Deere drivin'  
I'm a hick  
Ah har
