[Verse 1]  
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish I'd said  
At the dawning of the day  
I can't wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[Hook]  
I can't drown in your tears  
I won't face your fears  
I need to fight my own  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know I'll survive  
You'll never see me again
