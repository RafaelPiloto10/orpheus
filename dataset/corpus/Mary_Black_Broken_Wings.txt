A tall tree turn and face the west  
Oh we're running with the wind  
A high clifftop we're waiting with the rest  
For this journey to begin  
Chorus  
But these broken wings won't fly  
These broken wings won't fly  
These broken wings won't fly at all  
And oh how we laugh but maybe we should crawl  
And ask to be excused  
We shout loudly, have answers to it all  
Oh but we have been refused  
Chorus  
Girl child  
You're dancing with the stream  
Growing with the silver trees  
Your young questions  
You ask me what it means  
Oh but I am not at ease  
Chorus
