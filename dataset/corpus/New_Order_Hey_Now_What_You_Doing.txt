Hey now what you doing  
Don't go down the road to ruin  
Look back at where you came from  
Count to ten before you go wrong  
  
You had the brightest future  
Writing songs on your computer  
But you couldn't walk that extra mile  
And now your life is running wild  
  
You've gotta hold your head up high  
You know it's not too late to try  
You've gotta lift that heavy load  
You've gotta get back in control  
  
The things you say to me  
What is it that your eyes see  
Is it love or is it hate  
Banging on an open gate  
  
Hey now, who's that with you  
What's that thing I saw him give you  
Turn round don't come no closer  
You took it from my shoulder holster  
  
You've gotta hold your head up high  
You know it's not too late to try  
You've gotta lift that heavy load  
You've gotta get back in control  
  
You've gotta hold your head up high  
You know it's not too late to try  
You've gotta lift that heavy load  
You've gotta get back in control  
  
Why don't you put that gun right down  
Before you kill the love you found  
  
Hey now what you doing (what you doing)  
Don't go down the road to ruin
