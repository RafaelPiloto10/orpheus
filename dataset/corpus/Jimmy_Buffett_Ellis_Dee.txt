1970  
Why is he cussin' and callin' disgustin'  
The city that is now his home  
He never smiles or keeps up with styles  
He is black and he is all alone  
And you ask why he's this way  
Well brother you're too blind to see  
It's cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Get out of the street don't get high on my beat  
Go on home the policeman warns  
Just 'cause you're poor why do you declare war  
I can't help the way that you were born  
Why are they holdin' him down  
He's spending his life on his knees  
'cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Chorus:  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
Ellis got hooked, he got booked and he shook  
In his cold little shivery cell  
While out on the street in that same funky beat  
Mister pusher was doing well  
And ellis junior cries tears his daddy can't see  
'cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Chorus:  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
'cause ellis dee ain't fee like you and me  
No ellis dee ain't free like you and me
