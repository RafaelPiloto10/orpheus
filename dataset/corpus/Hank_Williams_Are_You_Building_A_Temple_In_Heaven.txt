Around me, many are building  
Temples of beauty and wealth  
But what of a temple in Heaven?  
Where will you live after death?  
Are you building a temple in Heaven  
To live in when this life is o'er?  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ evermore?  
So long is the road that leads you  
To that beautiful land up there  
Is work on your temple completed?  
Death may be lingering near  
Are you building a temple in Heaven  
To live in when this life is o'er?  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ evermore?  
Are you building a temple in Heaven  
To live in when this life is o'er?  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ evermore?
