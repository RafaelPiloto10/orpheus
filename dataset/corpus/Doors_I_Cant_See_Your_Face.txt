I can't see your face in my mind  
I can't see your face in my mind  
Carnival dogs consume the lines  
Can't see your face in my mind  
  
Don't you cry  
Baby  
Please don't cry  
And don't look at me with your eyes  
  
I can't seem to find the right lie  
I can't seem to find the right lie  
  
Insanity's horse adorns the sky  
Can't seem to fing the right lie  
  
Carnival dogs consume the lines  
Can't see your face in my mind  
  
Don't you cry  
Baby  
Please don't cry  
I won't need your picture  
Until we say good-bye
