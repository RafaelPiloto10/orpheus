Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came pouring down  
Me and billy were standing there we had a sliver half of crown  
Our arms are full of fishing rods had the tackle on our backs  
We just stood there gettin' wet with our backs against the fence  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
I hope it don't rain all day  
  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll  
Well it stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like going home, going home  
  
Rain let up and the sun came up we were getting dry  
Almost let a pickup truck nearly pass us by  
Well we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up the road  
We saw the swing and we jumped right in not to mention the fishing poles  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Let it run all over me  
  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like going home, and a jelly roll  
  
On the way back home we sang a song our throats were getting dry  
We saw a man from across the road he had the sunset in his eyes  
He lived all alone in his own little home he had a great big gallon jar  
There were bottles two, one for me and you and he said, "hey there you are"  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
I get it myself from the mountain stream  
  
It stones me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll  
  
It stoned me  
Just like jelly roll  
I'm coming home  
It stoned me just like going home
