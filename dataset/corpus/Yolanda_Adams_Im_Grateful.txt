I woke up this morning, closed in my right mind  
Counting all the blessings I've had in my lifetime  
I'm so fortunate to have someone like God  
Heavenly Father  
  
When I was having so many problems  
No one but Him could help me solve them  
He stepped in and He made everything okay  
And for this I'm so grateful  
  
I'm grateful, so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful, I'm so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
I don't mind sharing my testimony  
To anyone who hear it 'cause I'm lead by the spirit  
And it's possible that something I might say  
To help along the way  
  
Been through the storm but here I'm still standing  
On solid ground I keep on landing  
That's why I have so much faith in God  
For His love I'm grateful  
  
I'm grateful, so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful, I'm so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
I'm grateful, so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful, I'm so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
Yes, I'm grateful, yeah, I'm thankful  
He spared me, He gave another chance  
  
I'm grateful, so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful, I'm so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
I'm grateful, so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful, I'm so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
I'm grateful
