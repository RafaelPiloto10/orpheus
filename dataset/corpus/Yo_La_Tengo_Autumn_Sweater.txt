When I heard the knock on the door  
I couldn't catch my breath  
Is it too late to call this off  
  
We could slip away, wouldn't that be better  
Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater  
  
I tried my best to hide  
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible  
I wait for you, oh, most patiently  
  
So I looked for your eyes  
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them  
I'll try hard, I'll try always  
But it's a waste of time  
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily  
Like in the beginning  
In the beginning
