[Snoop Dogg]  
Yeah man, this is another 9 inch dick classic  
We want to dedicate this one, to all the fellas  
Who got a hard head bitch, who just won't listen  
Why'know? The best thing to do, is leave her  
Don't hit her, shake that ho (bitch I'm gone!)  
  
[Chorus: Soopafly]  
Bitch I'm gone, I can't take it no mo'  
I can't get through to you  
There's nothing I can say that you seem to understand  
Bitch I'm gone, I'm out oh yeah yeah yeah  
I'm through witchu  
Oh I'm through witchu, yeah  
  
[Soopafly]  
I knew that you, was a ho back then  
And bitch you're still one now  
Ya like to bust, nuts in your face  
But with that big-ass mouth  
You need to shut the fuck up, you talk too much  
I told you once before, yeah

So I'm walking out that door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Soopafly]  
(Bitch I'm gone) Bitch I'm through witchu

I can't be locked in your world  
(Bitch I'm gone) I need to breath, I got to roll

Instead of stepping your game up, you got pushed way to the back  
(Step off, step on back)  
I seen yo' expression, when you seen me pimping in the club  
It looked like, it looked like you wanted to break down, down and cry  
But I just didn't give a damn, I didn't give a damn, no no I didn't
