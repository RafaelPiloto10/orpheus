Rowan Atkinson:  
For years I thought  
I'd have to live alone  
I never got a letter  
Had to disconnect the phone  
The only girls I ever saw  
Were on tv  
But now I've got a Venus  
Who's sitting next to me  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Would I give my life  
To you if I could?  
Do birds fly?  
Do fish swim?  
And do bears sha-la-la-la-la  
In the woods?  
Rowan:  
I met her in the first class lounge  
Of a jumbo jet  
It was love at first sight  
Romeo and Juliet  
Kate:  
He looked pretty rich  
And I was down on m' luck  
So I charged him a fortune  
For a flying f...  
Rowan:  
... For crying out loud!  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Would I sacrifice my life  
To you if I could?  
Is the Pope Catholic?  
Is Luxembourg small?  
And do those hairy bears shhh...  
In the woods?  
Rowan:  
I introduced her round my friends  
She was ace  
I was no longer on Earth  
But in better place  
Kate:  
He's an utter creep and he  
Drives me round the bend  
And so to alleviate the boredom  
I sleep with his friends  
Rowan:  
Ho ha ho  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Kate:  
Would I tear out both my eyes  
And fry them if I could?  
Both:  
Is the Bible fiction?  
Is True Love a contradiction?  
And do bears sha-la-la-la-la  
In the woods?  
Do I desire you?  
Do I adore you?  
Rowan:  
Would I cut off all my toenails  
And put them in an envelope with my feet?  
Both:  
Is Reagan Godhead?  
Is Chairman Mao dead?  
And do those bears sha-la-la-la-la?  
Rowan [really Tim Brooke-Taylor]:  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-ah  
Kate:  
Mmmmm...  
Rowan [Tim]:  
And do those bears sha-la-la-la-la?  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-ah  
Kate:  
Ahoo Ahoo  
Yeah-ye-yeah Yeah-ye-yeah  
Both:  
Do those bears sha-la-la-la-ah?  
Rowan:  
On Main Street  
Kate:  
Oh Yeah Yeah-ye-yeah
