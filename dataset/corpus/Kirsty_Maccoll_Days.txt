Thank you for the days  
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me  
I'm thinking of the days  
I won't forget a single day believe me  
  
I bless the light  
I bless the light that lights on you believe me  
And though you're gone  
You're with me every single day believe me  
  
Days I'll remember all my life  
Days when you can't see wrong from right  
You took my life  
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me  
But it's alright  
Now I'm not frightened of this world believe me  
  
I wish today could be tomorrow  
The night is long  
It just brings sorrow let it wait
