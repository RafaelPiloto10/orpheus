Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Give a bat a bite  
Decorate your devil head with twinkling lights  
(Ozzy Christmas, Ozzy family Christmas)  
Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Let the F word fly  
From now on those censors will be up all night  
(All those bad words, motherbleeping bad words)  
  
He's repented his bolder days  
His druggie ways of yore  
Faithful friends who got smashed with him, don't bring hash to him no more  
(We're pretty sure)  
Through the slurs you almost can decipher  
When he speaks aloud  
He's the hottest star among the head-bang crowd  
So have yourself an Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy little Christmas now
