I'm sayin' all the things that I know you'll like  
Making good conversation I gotta handle you just right, you know what I mean  
I took you to an intimate restaurant, then to a suggestive movie  
There's nothing left to talk about 'less it's horizontally  
  
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
  
I've been patient, I've been good, try'n to keep my hands on the table  
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back, you know what I mean  
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view, we know each other mentally  
You've gotta know that you're bringin' out the animal in me  
  
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
  
Oh let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
Let's get animal, animal, I wanna get animal, let's get into animal  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk, let me hear your body talk
