He said  
"I was in my early forties  
With a lot of life before me  
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime  
I spent most of the next days  
Looking at the x-rays  
Talkin' 'bout the options  
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"  
I asked him  
"When it sank in  
That this might really be the real end  
How's it hit you  
When you get that kind of news?  
Man, what'd you do?"  
  
He said  
"I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying"  
  
He said  
"I was finally the husband  
That most of the time I wasn't  
And I became a friend a friend would like to have  
And all of a sudden going fishin'  
Wasn't such an imposition  
And I went three times that year I lost my dad  
I finally read the Good Book, and I  
Took a good, long, hard look  
At what I'd do if I could do it all again  
And then  
  
I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
Like tomorrow was a gift  
And you've got eternity  
To think about  
What you'd do with it  
What could you do with it  
What did I do with it?  
What would I do with it?  
  
Skydiving  
I went Rocky mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying"
