Loneliness cries deep from my soul,  
Keeps trying to tell me about the world growing so cold.  
Too many people trying to take from my earth,  
But we can't live without controlling our birth.  
  
Deep inside a voice cries out for you,  
It's not alone 'cause, people, I been cryin' too.  
If we don't stop what we all see is wrong,  
I guarantee you mankind won't live long.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a land, a glorius land,  
It's right here on earth.  
Understand what you can from the land,  
Your life is it's worth.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
  
To face the problems that everyone's found,  
We must replace what we took out of the ground.  
Pray for your brother, let your soul find a way,  
Help one another, oh, please listen to what I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loneliness  
Oh, I can't get away from loneliness  
Yeah, loneliness oooo  
Loneliness  
Yeah, loneli- loneli- lo-neliness  
I just can't get away from loneli- loneliness  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness
