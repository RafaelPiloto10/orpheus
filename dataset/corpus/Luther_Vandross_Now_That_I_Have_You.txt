You found me when I was alone  
You held me and you made my heart your home  
I sit around and dream  
And there's no one else I see  
Cuz there's no one else for me  
I don't feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I don't let anyone tell me what to do  
How to love, who to love  
They don't know you like I know you  
This is so natural, it's hard to believe  
People all around me  
And there's no one else I see  
Cuz there's no one else for me  
I don't feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I have the world, and I have no fears  
And I know where my happiness is  
Now that I've got you to care  
Now that you've got me forever  
Everything I don't want is gone  
And I know I can't live without your love  
  
All the things I wanted now  
Are starting to be true  
And all the dreams I ever dreamed  
Are coming now that I have you  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
Oh, now that I have you  
Now that I have you
