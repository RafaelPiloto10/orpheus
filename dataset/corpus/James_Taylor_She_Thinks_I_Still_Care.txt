Just because I ask a friend about her.  
Just because I spoke her name somewhere.  
Just because I rang her number by mistake today,  
She thinks I still care.  
  
Just because I hang out at the same ol' places  
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere.  
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be,  
She thinks I still care.  
  
But if she's happy thinking I still need her,  
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer.  
But how could she ever be so foolish?  
Oh, where would she get such an idea?  
  
Just because I ask a friend about her.  
Just because I spoke her name somewhere.  
Just because I saw her, then went all to pieces,  
She thinks I still care.  
She thinks I still care.
