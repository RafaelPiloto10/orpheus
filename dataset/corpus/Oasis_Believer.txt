(First verse)  
  
I thought love was only true in fairy tales,  
Meant for someone else but not for me,  
Love was out to get me, (Baddabudumbadum)  
That's the way it seems, (Baddabudumbadum)  
Dissapointment Haunted all my dreams,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And then I saw her face,  
Now I'm a believer,  
Not a trace,  
Of doubt in ma' mind,  
I'm in love, Oh! I'm a believer,  
I couldn't leave her if I tried,  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
I thought love was more or less a given thing,  
Seems the more you give,  
The less I got,  
Whats the use in trying, (Baddabudumbadum)  
All you get is pain, (Baddabudumbadum)  
When I needed sunshine I got rain,  
  
[Chorus:]
