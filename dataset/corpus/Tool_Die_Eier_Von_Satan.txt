Half a cup of powdered sugar  
One quarter teaspoon salt  
One knife tip Turkish hash  
Half a pound butter  
One teaspoon vanilla-sugar  
Half a pound flour  
A hundred and fifty g ground nuts  
A little extra powdered sugar  
And no eggs  
Place in a bowl  
Add butter  
Add the ground nuts and  
Knead the dough  
Form eyeball-size pieces from the dough  
Roll in the powdered sugar  
And say the Magic Words:  
"Sim sala bim bamba sala do saladim"  
Place on a greased baking pan and  
Bake at two hundred degrees for fifteen minutes  
And no eggs  
Bake at two hundred degrees for fifteen minutes  
And no eggs.
