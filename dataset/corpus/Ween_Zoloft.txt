Gimme that z, o-l-o-f-t  
Gimme a grip, make me love me  
Suckin' 'em down, I'm happy man  
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile  
  
Realize that the sky's not made of gold  
Don't disguise the nature of your soul  
  
Gimme that z, o-l-o-f-t  
No longer pissed and you don't bother me  
I'm makin' it through, I'm givin' my all  
When base are loaded, I'm whacking the ball  
  
Don't suck the mind, don't drain the source  
The path of life's not so easy to course, buddy
