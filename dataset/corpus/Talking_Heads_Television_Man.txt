I'm looking and I'm dreaming for the first time  
I'm inside and I'm outside at the same time  
And everything is real  
Do I like the way I feel?  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the world crashes in into my living room  
Television man made me what I am  
People like to put the television down  
But we are just good friends  
(I'm a) television man  
  
I knew a girl, she was a macho man  
But it's alright, I wasn't fooled for long  
This is the place for me  
I'm the king, and you're the queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a walk in the beautiful garden  
Everyone would like to say hello  
It doesn't matter what you say  
Come and take us away  
  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
  
And we are still good friends...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...and I'm gonna say  
We are still good friends...and I'm trying to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
We are still good friends...You know the way it is  
Television man...I've got what you need  
We are still good friends...I know the way you are  
Television man...I know what you're tryin' to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
That's how the story ends.
