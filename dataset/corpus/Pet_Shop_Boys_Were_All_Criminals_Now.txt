Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've changed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We're blamed  
We're all criminals now  
  
Just a routine procedure  
(We're watching you)  
A sample of your dna  
(The things you do)  
Queuing to be finger-printed  
(You could be dangerous)  
Going to the usa  
Another routine procedure  
(We're on your case)  
Driving in your car  
(We've seen your face)  
Stopped and searched and questioned  
(Some place before)  
Can you prove who you are?  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've changed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've been framed  
We're all criminals now  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey, hey  
We're all criminals now  
  
Got the bus to the station  
Music playing in my head  
Ran to get on the tube train  
Police shot someone dead  
  
Don't ask me how We're all criminals now  
  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We're blamed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've been framed  
We're all criminals now
