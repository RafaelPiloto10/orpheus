Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
You better enjoy yourself  
You better enjoy yourself  
  
You sittin' over there  
Starin' into space  
While people are dancin'  
Dancin' all over the place  
  
You shouldn't worry  
About the things ou can't control  
Come on girl while the night is young  
Why don't you make yourself race  
Make yourself go  
  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
  
Let's have some fun  
Let's have a good time you and me  
Sittin' there with your poked out  
Just as sweet as you can be  
  
Why don't you live  
Live the life you got  
Come on girl, let's get it  
While the feelin' is gettin' hot and hot  
  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
  
Hey there girl, I've been watchin' you  
I can wipe away that frown  
Oh, you and I can get together  
We can tear the house down  
We can tear the house down  
We can tear the whole house down  
  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself  
Enjoy yourself for me  
You better enjoy yourself  
You got to enjoy yourself
