There was a lot to make up  
For the time we'd had  
'Cause we'd been lonely far too long  
Had enough of feeling sad  
And no, it didn't take long  
To right all the wrong  
And hurt inside  
And now i can't believe what's happening  
Right before my eyes  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
  
We could have lost so easily  
And let it go  
We had no reason to believe  
That love was just about to grow  
And we got given a chance  
I'm so proud we didn't throw it away  
'Cause broken hearts lie on the pavement  
You see them every day  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
In the dark  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
  
Look at the rain  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm  
In our hearts  
In our hearts
