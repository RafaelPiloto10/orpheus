That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
  
When the day is so long that I can't hold on  
When I'm down and I think my hope is gone  
Oooh, Yeah,  
That's when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter daaaay  
I can feel my soul explodin'  
There's a good feelin'  
Helpin' me to find my waaay  
My, my, my way  
  
When the bluebird sings her sad, sad song  
And the wind brings a cold to tag along  
Oh, yeah,  
I can feel the spirit move me  
I can almost touch the sky  
Reachin' for a new tomorrow  
I know it's hard  
But music makes me waaaaanna try  
Wanna try  
And then  
That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah, yeah  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
Oh, yeah  
But when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter day  
I can feel my soul explodin'  
There's a good feelin'  
Helpin' me to fiiiiiiind my waaay  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And then I'm sayin'  
That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
(Clap)  
Happy, happy, happy day  
Happy, happy, happy day  
Happy, happy, happy day  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(And that's when the music takes me)  
Happy, happy when the music takes  
Whooooooo
