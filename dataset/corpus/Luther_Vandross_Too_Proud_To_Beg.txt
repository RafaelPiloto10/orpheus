Love came to me that day  
Stayed longer than I planned  
But change is good, they say  
So I rearranged my world for them  
For her and love and, here I go again  
I spoke to my heart  
Said, "Open up wide"  
Then got the message you had changed your mind  
And now here I am and I just don't understand  
Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen  
There can't be no "us" honey, if "you" are missin'  
Yes I love you, yes I need you  
ain't no world for me without you  
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love...  
And it hurts you anyway  
I can't lose my soul to hope and wishing  
You don't understand me, I know that you think...  
I don't love you, I don't need you  
But, my intentions are to love you  
See, I want you, I'm just too proud...  
To beg for your love  
So don't put me through it  
Take a little time to think about what you're doing  
And try to understand why...  
Yes I love you, yes I need you  
ain't no world for me without you  
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love...  
And it hurts you anyway
