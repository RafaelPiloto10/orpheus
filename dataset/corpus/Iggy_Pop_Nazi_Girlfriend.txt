I want to fuck her on the floor  
Among my books of ancient lore  
So I will make a full report  
I got a Nazi Girlfriend  
  
It's not the four-inch heels she wears  
It's not her baby-fine blond hair  
It's more the desert in her stare  
I've got a Nazi Girlfriend  
  
She's not the colt  
That she once was  
She's elegant  
But youth is lost  
Still she has ways to make me talk  
I love you Nazi Girl  
  
Her French is perfect  
So's her butt  
She wears two crosses  
Tangled up  
She's independent  
She's not dumb  
Tough little Nazi Girl  
  
So now I've fucked her on the floor  
Among my books of ancient lore  
And I have made a full report  
About a Nazi Girl
