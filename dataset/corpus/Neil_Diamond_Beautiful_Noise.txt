What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up from the street  
Got a beautiful sound  
It's got a beautiful beat  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
Goin' on everywhere  
Like the clickety-clack  
Of a train on a track  
It's got a rhythm to spare  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
And it's sound that I love  
And it's fit me as well  
As a hand in a glove  
Yes it does, yes it does  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up from the park  
It's the song of the kids  
And it plays until dark  
  
It's the song of the cars  
On their furious flights  
But there's even romance  
In the way that they dance  
To beat of the lights  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
And it's a sound that I love  
And it makes me feel good  
Like a hand in a glove  
Yes it does, yes it does  
What a beautiful noise  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
Made of joy an of strife  
Like a symphony played  
By a passing parade  
It's the music of life  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up to my room  
And it's beggin' for me  
Just to give it a tune
