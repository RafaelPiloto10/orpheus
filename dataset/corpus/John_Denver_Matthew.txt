Had an uncle named Matthew  
He was his father's only boy  
Born just South of Cobly, Kansas  
He was his mother's pride and joy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on  
Love is just the way to live and die  
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheat-field  
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky  
  
And all the stories that he told me  
Back when I was just a lad  
All the memories that he gave me  
All the good times that he had  
  
Growin' up a Kansas farmboy  
Life was mostly havin' fun  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a view beneath the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I guess there were some hard times  
And I'm told some years were lean  
They had a storm in forty-seven  
A twister came and stripped them clean  
  
He lost the farm and lost his family  
He lost the wheat and lost his home  
But he found a family Bible  
Faith as solid as a stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So he came to live at our house  
And he came to work the land  
He came to ease my Daddy's burden  
And he came to be my friend  
  
So, I wrote this down for Matthew  
And it's for him the song is sung  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a mule beneath the sun  
  
[Chorus x 2]
