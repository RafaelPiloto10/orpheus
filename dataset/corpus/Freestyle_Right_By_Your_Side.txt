Everyday we go through different things  
We may not know what tomorrow may bring  
But I know that I'll be okay  
Baby come what may  
And everyone has their share of ups and downs  
Never so sure of what fate will allow  
But I know somehow we'll make it through  
Just me and you  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side  
Ooh  
I know that you have been hurt before  
Feelin' like you couldn't trust anymore  
But it's always good to know that  
There's someone there for you  
Although sometimes things may not turn out right  
I'll be right here, you don't have to hide  
Whatever you feel inside we'll make it through,  
Just me and you  
We'll share the laughter  
And you know we'll also share the tears  
And when times are bad  
Just know that I'll always be here...  
Just remember -  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side  
Ooh  
I'll never go away  
I will be right here beside you  
I'll be with you all the way  
And I'll be here to stay with you  
Come what may...  
Just remember -  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side, ooh (repeat)  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side (fade)
