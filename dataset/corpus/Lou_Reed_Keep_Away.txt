You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself  
You know that I'm not seeing anyone else  
You just keep your ear down to the ground  
Yell your head off if you hear a sound  
Here's a whistle, a badge and a phone  
You can arrest me if I'm not at home  
And if I don't keep my word I swear  
I'll keep away  
  
Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher  
Here's Shakespeare's "Measure For Measure"  
Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag  
Why don't you blow them up if you think you've been had  
Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat  
An earring, a toothbrush and a cloak  
And if I don't keep my word I swear  
I'll keep away  
  
I swear I'll keep away
