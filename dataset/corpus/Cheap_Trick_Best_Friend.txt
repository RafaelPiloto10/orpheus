When the moon came up  
And the sun went down  
All I could see was a national frown  
It was pounded flesh  
And harder than steel  
Pretty in pink that's just how I feel  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend  
If you wanna be with me I'll be there til the end  
Til the end of time and time again  
Just leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah yeah  
Cause I'm my best friend now  
Cause I'm my best friend now  
  
All I got is might and will  
If all I got is might and will  
Can't slow down cause down we'll go  
Where I stop you don't wanna know  
Round and round and round we'll go  
Where I stop is where I wanna go  
Go go go go  
Where I wanna be is where I wanna go  
  
Lofty thoughts and high ideals  
Lofty skirts is what appeals  
This baby is no baby ruth  
He was too smart for her  
She was so damned cute  
I'm sick and tired can't be late  
So damn mad I can't keep straight  
Time and time and time again  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah  
  
I'm my best friend yeah  
I'm my best friend yeah  
I'm my best friend yeah
