I'm sorry if I have misled you  
I never meant to do you wrong  
But I would like to find the answers  
I've been searching for so very long, so long  
  
I know you must be tired of chasing me blues  
When happiness is so hard to find  
We've been through so many things together  
I can see it's hurting you inside  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end it's all wrong  
But I know when it's over I'll still love you  
We'll be together or I'll be alone  
  
The years have passed and I've become so jaded  
I'm leaving all my dreams behind  
And now that we are here together  
You're the only thing on my mind  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end it's all wrong  
But I know when it's over I'll still love you  
We'll be together or I'll be alone  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end it's all wrong  
But I know when it's over I'll still love you  
We'll be together or I'll be alone
