Mama, we're gon' be aight  
Man, I miss my brother, I swear to God  
I'm still mad at myself that I couldn't take the charge  
I remember like yesterday, phone ringing up off the hook  
Pandemonium in the north, what happened to juk?  
Shit, I don't know, guess the same old bullshit  
Fed's said, DP got caught with half a brick  
That damn near stopped my heart  
'Cause me and knowing my brother I'm thinking this shit hard  
But luckily it was soft and fortunately he was straight  
We're findin' to take it to trial, but went on sign for eight  
Mama, we're gon' be straight, lil' sister we're gon' be cool  
I know that my brother strong, so I did what I had to do  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Li'l sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
His sister taking it bad, mama trying to be strong  
Couple calendar years, I never shedded a tear  
Wrote him a couple letters to tell him I'm doin' better  
Told him, I took his Chevy and put the shit back together  
Told him, I'm gettin' money, I counted a hundred G's  
Told me to slow it down, play the shit low key  
Told me to make it happen, focus more on rappin'  
'Cause fuckin' round in these streets that anything can happen  
Told me I had heart, plus he knew I was smart  
The only thing that'd break his heart is  
If I fuck around and catch a charge  
Told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer  
And do what I had to do to overcome the struggles  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Finally made parol, they think he gon' change his life  
I axed him what he gon' do, he said he's gon' walk light  
It wasn't a year later, he smokin' behind tint  
Half an ounce of the reddy rock, man they got his ass again  
Judge gave him a bond, now he out on the run  
With that fuck the world attitude, still totin' a gun  
Still havin' his fun, we clubbin' it on the weekend  
Thought I had conversations 'bout going to turn himself in  
Wanted to raise his son, gon' get the shit behind him  
Plus he knew it's only so long before they find him  
Lawyer was talking good, say he gon' get three  
When the prosecutor quit yellin' they gave my brother eleven  
My mama damn near fainter, my brother didn't want to accept it  
The hardest part for me, I couldn't do nothing to help it  
Rap shit paid off, now we all on TV  
My brother say, he good, he finally feel free  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay  
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith  
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight
