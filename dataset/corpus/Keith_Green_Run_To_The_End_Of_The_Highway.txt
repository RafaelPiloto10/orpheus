Well you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking
for,  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Well I came running when I got the news that you were leaving.  
Oh, Ive gotta talk some sense to you, cause Im your friend.  
You say you want to hit the road cause life is so deceiving.  
Do you think its different at the other end?  
So you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for.  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Oh I came running when I got the news that you were crying.  
Oh my friend has life been so unkind to you?  
You say you want to find a place where people are not lying.  
If you find a place like that Ill go there too.  
Oh, you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for.  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Yes, to find yourself, youve got to start right here.
