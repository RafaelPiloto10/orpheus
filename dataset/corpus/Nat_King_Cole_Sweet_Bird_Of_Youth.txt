The Sweet Bird Of Youth  
Nat King Cole  
The sweet bird of youth soon flies away  
And nothing can make him stay?  
The sweet bird of youth soothes us his sound  
To waste precious time is wrong  
So come to my arms,  
We?re young but we?ll learn  
That lips unkissed like moments missed  
Can never return  
How sad is the truth?try though we may  
The sweet bird of youth flies away  
The sweet bird of youth flies away
