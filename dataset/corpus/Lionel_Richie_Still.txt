Lady, morning's just a moment away,  
And I'm without you once again.  
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,  
I wonder if you need me now.  
We played the games that people play, we made mistakes along the way.  
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.  
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,  
But then most of all, I do love you  
Still.  
  
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,  
Those feelings we can't put aside.  
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand,  
But it's so heavy on my mind.  
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.  
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?  
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.  
But then most of all, I do love you  
Still.  
  
We played the games that people play,  
We made mistakes along the way.  
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.  
Cause I needed you so desperately.  
We were too blind to see, but then,  
Most of all, I do love you
