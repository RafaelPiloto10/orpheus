After all these years  
After all these tears between us  
Still I couldn't find  
Someone half as right as you  
And each time I stop to think  
What it is I really need  
Here's what I conclude  
All I really need is you  
  
Just say what you want to say  
You don't have a chance in the world  
Can I, knowing how I've tried  
Still come close to losing you, girl  
When you are my world  
Have I spent so many years  
Trying but in vain to tell you  
Don't you know it's true  
All I really need is you  
  
How was I to know  
We'd have ended here  
Where we finally did  
You tied your life to mine  
Once upon a starry night  
And when someone asks for me  
What it is that I believe  
Say, I believe it's true  
All I really need is you  
  
Just say what you want to say  
We don't have a chance in the world  
Can I, knowing how I've tried  
Still come close to losing you, girl  
When you are my world  
Have I spent so many years  
Tryin' but in vain to tell you  
Feelings come and go  
Me, I'm never gonna ever let you go  
Promise you I'm gonna always love you so  
Cause all I really need is you
