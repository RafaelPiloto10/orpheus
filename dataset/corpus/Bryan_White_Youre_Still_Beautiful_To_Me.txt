Turn out the lights and close the door  
Put your head on the pillow  
Let me keep you warm  
I want to run my hands across your face  
Lyin' beside you is still the perfect place  
We're still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
  
Babe in every way  
You're still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
You're still beautiful to me  
  
Lay back baby and close your eyes  
Let me do everything your heart desires  
When I think of the years making love to you  
There still ain't nothing that I'd rather do  
There's something I can't deny  
You sure know how to move this guy  
  
Babe in every way  
You're still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
You're still beautiful to me  
  
(And it still feels good)  
It still feels good  
It still runs deep  
When you get close, babe  
I still get weak  
"Cause in these arms is where you belong  
We're still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
Hey babe, you're still number one  
Baby can't you see  
  
You're still beautiful to me  
You'll always be so beautiful to me
