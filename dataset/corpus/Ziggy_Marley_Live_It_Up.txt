If life means what it means to me  
Happiness come from the way we live  
Not the money we receive  
'Cause even the poor man is rich  
Love in our hearts  
Health strength and longevity  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Live it up  
Live it up don't give it up  
  
If right means what it means to me  
Before words were spoken  
JAH law was written within  
IF right means what it means to you  
What the preacher say is not what the prach do  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Life for me  
life for you life for me  
Life for you  
[repeat]  
  
There is no owner's manual for the life that we lead  
Learn as you grow  
More power to you  
In life there's many stages but don't you quit  
'Cause when the table turn more power to you  
More powe to you  
Good now  
Everyone feeling  
Good now [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Living  
Giving  
Sharing  
Loving  
Living  
Giving  
Sharing  
Loving  
Live it up  
Live it up  
Don't give it up
