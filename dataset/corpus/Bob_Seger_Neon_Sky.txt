Words and music by bob seger  
There's the neon sky that I know so well  
There's the smoky room where I chose to dwell  
Though I hear your heart many miles away  
The neon sky tells me I must stay  
  
Through the windy field of another land  
I have seen your face, girl, I have held your hand  
Though I should be there, with you there today  
The neon sky knows that I must stay  
  
Cause the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been  
  
On a dusty stage, many years ago,  
I chose my road, still I hope you know  
That there'll come a day with the neon sky  
When we'll walk into the sun, you and I  
  
Yes so he calls, beckons unto me  
From the empty hall, from the galleries  
And so I must go, leave you here today  
Cause the neon sky orders me away  
Yes, the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been
