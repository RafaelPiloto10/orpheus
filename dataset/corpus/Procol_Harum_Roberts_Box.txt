Doctor where's your remedy?  
I've got enough to pay the fee  
Can't you see I'm awful sick?  
I'll pay you well to do the trick  
  
Doctor where's your magic box  
There's no one here to count the cost  
Name your price and make the sale  
There's no-one here to tell the tale  
  
Doctor please don't lock your door  
I've never troubled you before  
Just a pinch to ease the pain  
I'll never trouble you again
