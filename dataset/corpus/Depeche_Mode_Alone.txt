I was there when you needed me most  
I was there when you wanted me least  
I was your father, your son,  
And your holy ghost and priest  
  
Through your failures and success  
Through your losses and gains  
I didn't see much happiness or pain  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't fill that hole  
Alone  
  
I saw you at your best  
I knew you at your worst  
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed  
  
There's a thin grey line  
Between the black and white  
It's evidently hard to find at night  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't play that role  
Alone  
  
Now it's too, too late for  
words That should have been said  
Long ago  
  
I was there when you needed me most  
I was there when you wanted me least  
I was your father, your son,  
And your holy ghost and priest  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't fill that hole  
Alone
