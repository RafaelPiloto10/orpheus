I'm goin' to Hollywood, they'll see that I'm so good  
I won't care how I feel, and I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
I want to be a star, I'm going to have a car  
And you'll have to admit, I'll be rich as shit  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
I would give you some, if you only would have treated me nice  
You'll wish that you did, you'll feel pretty stupid  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
It's fun to be a star, it's nice to have a car  
Yeah, you'll have to admit, that I'll be rich as shit  
And I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
The money will roll right in
