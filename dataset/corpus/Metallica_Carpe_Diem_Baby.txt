Hit dirt  
Shake tree  
Split sky  
Part sea  
Strip smile  
Lose cool  
Bleed the day  
And break the rule  
Live to win  
Dare to fail  
Eat the dirt  
And bite the nail  
Then make me miss you  
Then make me miss you  
So wash your face away with dirt  
It don't feel good until it hurts  
So take this world and shake it  
Come squeeze and suck the day  
Come carpe diem baby  
Draw lead  
Piss wine  
Sink teeth  
All mine  
Stoke fire  
Break neck  
Suffer through this  
Cheat on death  
Hug the curve  
Loose the time  
Tear the map  
And shoot the sign  
Then make me miss you  
Oh yeah  
Then make me miss you  
So wash your face away with dirt  
It don't feel good until it hurts  
So take this world and shake it  
Come squeeze and suck the day  
Come carpe diem baby  
Yeah, suck it  
Live to win  
Dare to fail  
Eat dirt  
Bite the nail  
Strip smile  
Lose cool  
Bleed the day  
And break the rule  
Under curve  
Noose the time  
Tear the map  
And shoot the sign  
Then make me miss you  
Come on, come on  
Then make me miss you  
So wash your face away with dirt  
It don't feel good until it hurts  
So take this world and shake it  
Come squeeze and suck the day  
Come make me miss you  
Come carpe diem baby  
Come carpe diem baby
