Close your eyes so your don't feel them  
They don't need to see you cry  
I can't promise I will heal you  
But if you want to I will try  
  
I'll sing this somber serenade  
The past is done  
We've been betrayed  
It's true  
Someone said the truth will out  
I believe without a doubt, in you  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you gave me what I need  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
For eternity  
  
Yesterday when you were walking  
We talked about your mum and dad  
What they did that made you happy  
What they did that made you sad  
We sat and watched the sun go down  
Picked a star before we lost the moon  
Youth is wasted on the young  
Before you know it's come and gone to soon  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you gave me what I need  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
For eternity  
  
For eternity  
I'll sing this somber serenade  
The past is done  
We've been betrayed  
It's true  
Youth is wasted on the young  
Before you know it's come and gone to soon  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you are a friend indeed  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you are a friend indeed  
And I know you'll find your freedom  
Eventually  
For eternity  
For eternity
