There's a spark of magic in your eyes  
And Candyland appears each time you smile  
Never thought that fairytales came true  
But they come true, when I'm near you  
Your a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise  
  
And, Betcha by golly Wow!  
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever  
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong  
  
Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words  
To express all he feels inside  
But ever just so often  
The words of another, who's truly in love  
Seem to work our just fine  
  
To say I love you  
To say.....  
I love you  
  
Keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong
