She's a force of nature that I can't outrun  
A devil and a savior, all in one  
Her eyes can heal me or they can make me bleed  
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry  
But never really knowing just who I am  
And I confess that I don't mind at all  
'Cause I would trade the world away to stay inside this dream  
I'll never find a better place to fall, no, no  
I got a lover, a brown skin girl  
She's got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire  
She knows a way, a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah  
I get a strong vibration  
When she just says my name  
And it drives me crazy  
'Cause I don't know if she feels the same  
But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does  
She laughs and says that I'm under her spell  
Now I won't lie, I enjoy the ride and pray it never ends  
I feel her deeper than anything I've felt  
I got a lover, a brown skin girl  
She's got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire  
She knows a way, a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire  
Oh, I can't help but crave another taste of her  
Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain  
And how she worked her way inside, I'll never understand  
She's too beautiful to ever take the blame  
But she'll always fan the flame  
My brown skin girl, my brown skin girl  
I got a lover, a brown skin girl  
She's got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire  
She knows a way, a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah  
I got a lover, a brown skin girl  
She's got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire  
She knows a way, a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire
