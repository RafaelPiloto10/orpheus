(Susanna Clark)  
  
If they'll play another love song  
And if that Miller Highlife light stays dim  
And if you'll keep my glass full of whiskey  
I'll whisper words I wish I'd said to him  
  
Just ask me to dance all the slow ones  
Hold me close and take me 'cross the floor  
I'll gently lay my head on your shoulder  
And pretend this never happened before  
  
I don't want to hear a sad story  
We both already know how it goes  
So if you'll be my tall dark stranger  
I'll be your San Antone Rose  
  
I wish I could tell you I love you  
I wish that he weren't always on my mind  
I wishes were fast trains to Texas  
I'd ride and I'd ride, how I'd ride
