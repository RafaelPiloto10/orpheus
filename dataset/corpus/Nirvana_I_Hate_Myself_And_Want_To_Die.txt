Runny nose and runny yolk  
Even if you have a cold still  
You can cough on me again  
I still haven't had my fulfill  
  
In the someday what's that sound?  
  
Broken heart and broken bones  
Think about some capsules of horse pills  
One more quirky cliched phrase  
You're the one I wanna refill  
  
In the someday what's that sound?  
  
Most people don't realize  
That two large pieces of coral,  
Painted brown, and attached to his skull  
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer
