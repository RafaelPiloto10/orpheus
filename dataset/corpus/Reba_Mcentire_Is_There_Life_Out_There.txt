She married when she was twenty  
She thought she was ready  
Now she's not so sure  
She thought she'd done some living  
But now she's just wonderin'  
What she's living for  
Now she's feeling that there's something more  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there life out there  
So much she hasn't done  
Is there life beyond  
Her family and her home  
She's done what she should  
Should she do what she dares  
She doesn't want to leave  
She's just wonderin  
Is there life out there  
  
She's always lived for tomorrow  
She's never learned how  
To live for today  
She's dyin' to try something foolish  
Do something crazy  
Or just get away  
Something for herself for a change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place in the sun that she's never been  
Where life is fair and time is a friend  
Would she do it the same as she did back then  
She looks out the window and wonders again  
  
[Chorus: x2]
