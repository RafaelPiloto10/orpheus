I have climbed highest mountain  
I have run through the fields  
Only to be with you, only to be with you  
I have run, I have crawled  
Well, I have scaled these city walls  
These city walls only to be with you  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
Well, I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing, fingertips  
It burned like fire, this burning desire  
I have spoke tongue of angels  
And I have held hand of the devil  
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
I believe in the kingdom come  
When all the colors bleed into one  
Bleed into one and yes, I'm still running  
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross of my shame  
Of my shame and you know, I believed it  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
What I'm looking for, what I'm looking for  
What I'm looking for, what I'm looking for
