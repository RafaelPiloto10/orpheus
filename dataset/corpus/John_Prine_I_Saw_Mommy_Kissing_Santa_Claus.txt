Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Johnny wears a funny smile on his face  
Johnny has a secret, and a secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody, so he tells his Teddy Bear  
  
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
Well, she didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
She though that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
What a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had walked in  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
  
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
Well, she didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
She though that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
But I know I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
What a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had walked in  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night (One more time!)  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
On the Lips!
