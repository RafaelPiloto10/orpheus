Little darling  
On the factory floor  
Sirens are wailing  
They are calling you like lovers  
They always want more  
  
Department 27  
Deep down below  
You are piecing together  
The seeds of the world  
  
Ashen roses  
Growing darkness  
Starving children  
Someday you stand up and dance  
  
Glittering sunlight,  
Keep on shining  
And put them together  
The seeds of the world  
  
Binding all the flowers of the world  
Start bursting into millions of colours  
Unfold all the flags of the nations  
Kiss me again, let the battle start  
  
Little darling  
What have you done  
Hearts are breaking  
Live without ending,  
Numberless men  
  
Never relaxing  
I have to see it all  
Fire, desert, cold and arid  
And all in a flash  
  
Binding all the flowers of the world  
Start bursting into millions of colours  
Unfold all the flags of the nations  
Kiss me again, let the battle start
