If I could find a way  
To soothe your troubled mind  
Then I would erase your fears  
And help you to unwind.  
I would ease the burden  
That you carry everyday.  
Oh, don't you know I'd find a cure  
And take your pain away.  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
And even though you're far from here  
Don't forget I'm always near.  
Find comfort in these words I send  
In this cold world.  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
For every aching heart  
For every broken soul  
  
So give up your worries  
They'll only do you harm.  
There is no need to be concerned  
It's just a false alarm.
