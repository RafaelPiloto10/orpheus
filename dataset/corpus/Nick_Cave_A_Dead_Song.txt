This is True  
Mister nothing said forever said  
I can sing  
Hit it! Make it a dead one  
With words like  
Blood, soldier mother  
O. K. O. K.  
I want to sleep before the end  
Which is impolite  
Hit It! Make it a dead one  
If nothing crops up  
I'll give you a ring  
You can sing the end  
O. K O. K.  
Then I could get  
All the little animals out of my room  
Hit it! With a broom  
O. K O. K  
Put them in a big white sack  
No visitors came  
Hit it! With words like.....  
Thou shalt not  
The end
