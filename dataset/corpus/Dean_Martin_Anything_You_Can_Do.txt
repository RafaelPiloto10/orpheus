I'm superior, you're inferior  
I'm the big attraction you're the small  
I'm the major one you're the minor one  
I can beat you singing that's not all  
  
Anything you can do I can do better  
I can do anything better than you  
No you can't yes I can  
No you can't yes I can  
No you can't yes I can yes I can  
(Are we running over) (You're cheating)  
  
Well anything you can be I can be greater (I don't think so)  
Sooner or later I'm greater than you  
(No you're not) Yes I am  
(Nah, you're not) (Yes I am yes I am)  
  
I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge  
I can get a sparrow with a bow and arrow  
I can live on bread and cheese (and only that)  
Yes (So can a rat)  
  
Anything you can sing I can sing louder  
I can sing anything louder than you  
(No you can't) Yes I can  
(No you can't) Yes I can  
(No you can't) Yes I can yes I can, Enzio
