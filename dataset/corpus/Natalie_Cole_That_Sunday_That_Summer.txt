If I had to choose just one day  
To last my whole life through  
It would surely be that Sunday  
The day that I met you  
  
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills  
Summer was a-coming in but fast  
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills  
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper  
"Go on, kiss him, go on and kiss him"  
  
If I had to choose one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would be that tender moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me  
That way, that Sunday, that summer  
"Go on, kiss him, go on and kiss him"  
  
And if I had to choose just one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would surely be that moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me  
That way, that Sunday, that summer  
  
(If I had to choose just one day)...
