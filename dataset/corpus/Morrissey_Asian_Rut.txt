Day oh so late  
Strangely the sun still shone  
Ooh Asian boy  
What are you on?  
Day oh so late  
Strangely the sun still shone  
Oh Asian boy  
What are drugs are you on?  
  
Oh...strange  
  
Tooled-up Asian boy  
Has come to take revenge  
For the cruel, cold killing  
Of his very best friend  
Tooled-up Asian boy  
Has come to avenge  
The cruel, cold killing  
Of his only friend  
  
Ha! La, la, la, oh...  
  
There's peace through our school  
It's so quiet in the hall  
It's a strange sign for one  
Of what's to come  
Tough and cold and pale  
Oh, they may just impale you on railings  
Oh, English boys  
It must be wrong  
Three against one?  
  
Oh...  
  
Brakes slammed, and  
His gun jammed, and  
As far as I could tell  
Brave Asian boy  
Was dealt a blow and fell  
  
I'm just passing through here  
On my way to somewhere civilized  
And maybe I'll even arrive  
Maybe I'll even arrive
