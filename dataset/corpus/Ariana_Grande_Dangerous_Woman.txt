[Verse 1]  
Don't need permission  
Made my decision to test my limits  
Cause it's my business, God as my witness  
Start what I finished  
Don't need no hold up  
Taking control of this kind of moment  
I'm locked and loaded  
Completely focused, my mind is open  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God  
Don't ya stop, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout  
  
[Verse 2]  
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and  
Know what I'm doing  
The way we're movin' like introducing  
Us to a new thing  
I wanna savor, save it for later  
To taste the flavor, cause I'm a taker  
Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature  
I live for danger  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God  
Don't ya stop, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
  
[Refrain]  
All girls wanna be like that  
Bad girls underneath, like that  
You know how I'm feeling insideSomethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout  
All girls wanna be like that  
Bad girls underneath, like that  
You know how I'm feeling inside  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout  
  
[Instrumental Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
[Refrain]  
All girls wanna be like that  
Bad girls underneath like that  
You know how I'm feeling inside  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout  
All girls wanna be like that  
Bad girls underneath like that  
You know how I'm feeling inside  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
