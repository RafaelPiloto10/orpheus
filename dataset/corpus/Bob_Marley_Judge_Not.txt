Don't you look at me so smug  
And say I'm going bad.  
Who are you to judge me  
And the life that I live?  
I know that I'm not perfect  
And that I don't claim to be.  
So before you point your fingers,  
Be sure your hands are clean.  
Judge not  
Before you judge yourself.  
Judge not  
If you're not ready for judgement. Woah oh oh!  
The road of life is rocking  
And you may stumble too.  
So while you talk about me,  
Someone else is judging you.  
(Saxophone solo)  
Judge not  
Before you judge yourself.  
Judge not  
If you're not ready for judgement. Woah oh oh!  
The road of life is rocky  
And you may stumble too.  
So while you talk about me  
Someone else is judging you,  
Someone else is judging you,  
Someone else is judging you,  
Someone else is judging you,  
Someone else is judging you.  
(fadeout)
