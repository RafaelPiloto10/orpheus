You are a girl from the country  
Your eyes remind me of the sun  
You came to visit in the city  
And won the heart's of everyone  
  
You are a girl from the country  
Your hair is colored like the corn  
I have never been outside the city  
I am no friend to anyone  
  
[Chorus]  
Country girl won't you stay a while  
Won't you stay a while with me  
Country girl won't you stay a while  
Let me see you smile for me  
  
You are a girl from the country  
Before you came I was alone  
Please say you'll take me to the country  
And let me share your country home  
  
[Chorus]
