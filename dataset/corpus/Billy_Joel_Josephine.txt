Didn't cha know what I mean  
When I said 'I love you Josephine'? Yeah  
Josephine.  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Or lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine.  
  
Like a beautiful queen  
You deserve a crown  
My Josephine. Yeah  
Josephine.  
Well I pick up the phone and give you a call  
You come around with your sneakers and all  
Josephine.  
  
Well  
Sit right back. Suppose I went away. Ah  
Honey.  
Would your love turn sour and moldy green?  
When I take from you the light of yoodle-eh-hi-hoo  
Would I make you sad  
My Josephine?  
  
You arrived on the scene  
You made me glad I'm alive  
My Josephine. Yeah  
Josephine.Well  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine.
