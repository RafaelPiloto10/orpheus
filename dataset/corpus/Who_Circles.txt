Circles  
My head is going 'round in circles  
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool  
Draggin' me down  
  
Time  
Will tell if I'll take the homeward track  
Dizziness will make my feet walk back  
Walk right back to you  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I can't get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Round and around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
  
Round and round and round  
Like a fool I go  
Down and down in the pool I go  
Draggin' me down  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I can't get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Just one thing could kill the pain  
Of leaving you  
But it gets me so dizzy that I'm walkin' right back again  
Back to you  
  
Time  
Will tell if these dreams are ? fact  
Though I left I'm comin' back  
Comin' on home to you
