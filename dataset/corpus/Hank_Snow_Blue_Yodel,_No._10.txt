Something about you, mama  
That sure gives me the blues  
Something about you mama  
That sure gives me the blues  
It ain't your drop stitch stockings  
It ain't your blue buckled shoes.  
  
You know, purdy mama  
I'm bound to love you some  
You know, purdy mama  
I'm bound to love you some  
'Cause I've done more for you  
Than anybody ever done  
You know it, baby.  
  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog, too  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog, too  
My purdy mama don't love me  
But my bulldog do.  
  
There's been a groundhog rootin'  
Around my yard at night  
There's been a groundhog rootin'  
Around my yard at night  
From the way my mama been treatin' me  
He must be rootin' alright  
Lord have mercy.  
  
Well, I ain't no cheatin' man  
Don't try to fool no girls  
I ain't no cheatin' man  
Don't try to fool no girls  
It's my regular lovin'  
That gets me by in this world...
