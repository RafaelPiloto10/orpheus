Whatever I do, wherever I go  
The same afterglow  
Is keepin' me low  
Don't wanna lose it  
But don't wanna stay here too long  
  
They see you go by  
I tell you no lie  
You're up in the sky, make everyone cry  
Don't wanna lose it  
But don't wanna stay around here  
  
I'm on the run again  
I'm on the run again  
But it's like what they say  
When it happens this way  
You gotta do it again and again  
  
I hear them talkin' and they go on and on  
They think that nothing is wrong  
And so they just carry on about you  
Don't wanna lose it  
But I gotta move out of here  
  
I see them waiting there for most of the day  
I known you asked them to stay  
But they just won't go away  
Don't wanna lose it  
But I gotta do it again  
  
I'm on the run again  
I'm on the run again  
But it's like what they say  
When it happens this way  
You gotta do it again and again  
  
I know it ain't real  
But when you are near  
You're saying the things that I wanna hear  
Don't wanna lose it  
But I gotta do it again  
  
I'm on the run again  
I'm on the run again  
But it's like what they say  
When it happens this way  
You gotta do it again and again  
  
I'm on the run again  
I'm on the run again  
But it's like what they say  
When it happens this way  
You gotta do it again and again  
  
Run around gotta go, gotta run around  
Run around gotta go, gotta run  
Run around gotta go, gotta run around  
Run around gotta go, gotta run  
  
Woman, I gotta move around  
Woman, I gotta better way  
Woman, I gotta move around
