Let's start at the very beginning  
A very good place to start  
When you read, you begin with--  
[LITTLE GIRL] A, be, see!  
[MARIA] When you sing, you begin with Do, Re, Mi  
[CHILDREN] Do, Re, Mi  
[MARIA] Do, Re, Mi  
The first three notes just happen to be  
Do, Re, Mi  
[CHILDREN] Do, Re, Mi  
[MARIA] Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti  
[SPOKEN] Come, I'll make it easy for you. Listen:  
  
[SUNG] Doe, a deer, a female deer  
Ray, a drop of golden sun  
Me, a name, I call myself  
Far, a long, long way to run  
Sew, a needle pulling thread  
La, a note to follow So  
Tea, a drink with jam and bread  
That will lead us back to Do, oh, oh, oh  
[WITH CHILDREN] Doe, a deer, a female deer  
Ray, a drop of golden sun  
Me, a name, I call myself  
Far, a long, long way to run  
Sew, a needle pulling thread  
La, a note to follow So  
Tea, a drink with jam and bread  
That will lead us back to Do  
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do-- So-- Do  
  
[SPOKEN] Now, children, once you have these notes in your head, you can sing a  
million tunes by mixing them up--like this:  
[SUNG] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re... [SPOKEN] Now you do it.  
[CHILDREN] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re  
[MARIA] So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do  
[CHILDREN] So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do  
[MARIA, SPOKEN] Now let's put it all together:  
[SUNG BY ALL] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re  
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do  
[LITTLE GIRL] But it doesn't mean anything!  
[MARIA] So we put in words--one word for every note:  
[SUNG] When you know the notes to sing  
You can sing most an--why--thing. [SPOKEN] Together!  
[SUNG BY ALL] When you know the notes to sing  
You can sing most an--why--thing  
Doe, a deer, a female deer  
Ray, a drop of golden sun  
Me, a name, I call myself  
Far, a long, long way to run  
Sew, a needle pulling thread  
La, a note to follow So  
Tea, a drink with jam and bread  
That will lead us back to Do  
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do-- So-- Do
