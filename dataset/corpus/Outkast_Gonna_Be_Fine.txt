Can't believe you would leave me this way.  
Feelin kinda bad from the last things we said today.  
Can't believe you would turn and walk away.  
You know we do this again and again.  
  
(pre chorus) You say you love me,  
I come back with I hate you.  
Only takes me a day to,  
Realize I'm in love with you.  
You say it's over  
I come back with just stay boy  
If you don't want my love,  
Then I have no choice this time.  
  
(chorus)Tell me baby, what to do.  
I ain't trippin over you.  
Any, any other time,  
Remember I'm gone be fine!  
How can't I make mistakes,  
I dunno whats up with you.  
Any, any other time  
Remember I'm gone be fine!  
  
Said you didn't mean it, that's fine.  
You wanna take it back cause you're  
Having a change of mind.  
Sometimes sayin sorry won't do  
But then some days I just can't do with out you  
(Pre chorus 3x)...  
(chorus 3x)  
  
Rap(Outkast):  
Yo, yo  
Across the way  
The milkman delivered this  
Everyday on schedule  
Ain't good use to cry over spilled lactose  
When you got these vegetables  
The four food groups  
Ain't nothing but  
Four ways to keep four families paid  
Oprah went from one line to  
Telling y'all silly ass rock upstate  
  
Yeah  
So for one, girl  
When I met you  
I'ma say this  
You's was fine  
You traveled around the block  
I let you drive the 'Lac one time  
Maybe your hearts at stake  
Some of the people around  
You act of fate  
'Cuz you can't  
Cake up, wake up  
Picture make up  
Straight up like that  
  
Chorus three times fading
