Say what you wanna  
But I'm here to stay  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
You can go where you're gonna  
But don't get in my way  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You'll be standing in a draft  
If you don't hear me laugh  
And if you happen to come around  
Well, you best not make me frown  
For I just might knock you down  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You know I'm ready to fight  
And turn your day into night  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
If you're half bright  
You'll detour to the right  
From a mean ole lion  
  
All you strangers better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Don't just stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
Look,  
You better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Don't stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
I'm a mean ole lion  
I'm a mean ole lion
