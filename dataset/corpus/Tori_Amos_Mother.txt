Go go go go now  
Out of the nest it's time  
Go go go now  
Circus girl without a safety net  
Here here here now don't cry  
You raised your hand for the assignment  
Tuck those ribbons under your helmet  
Be a good soldier  
First my left foot then my right behind the other  
Pantyhose running in the cold  
  
Mother the car is here  
Somebody leave the light on  
Green limousine for the redhead dancing dancing girl  
And when I dance for him  
Somebody leave the light on  
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from  
  
I walked into your dream  
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream  
You are the clever one aren't you  
Brides in veils for you  
We told you all of our secrets  
All but one  
And don't you even try  
The phone has been disconnected  
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice  
Poison me against the moon  
  
Mother the car is here  
Somebody leave the light on  
Black chariot for the redhead dancing dancing girl  
He's gonna change my name  
Maybe you'll leave the light on  
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from  
  
I escape into your escape into our very favorite fearscape  
It's across the sky and across my heart and I cross my legs oh my God  
First my left foot then my right behind the other  
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow  
  
Oo who mother  
Oo mother the car is here  
Maybe maybe you'll leave the light on for the for the for the dancing girl  
He's gonna change my name  
Maybe you'll leave the light  
Just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come come from  
  
Mother mother mother
