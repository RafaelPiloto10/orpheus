[Verse:]  
Don't let no small frustration,  
Ever bring you down (No, no, no, no),  
Just take a situation,  
And turn it all around,  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
With a new attitude everything can change,  
Make it how you want it to be,  
Staying mad, why do that, Give yourself a break,  
Laugh about it and you'll see!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Life's what you make it,  
So let's make it rock,  
Life's what you make it,  
So come on, come on, (Everybody Now)!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't be sad, broken-hearted,  
There's so much to do (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Life's is hard, or it's party,  
The choice is up to you!  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
With a new attitude everything can change,  
Make it how you want it to be,  
Staying sad, why do that, Give yourself a break,  
I know you wanna party with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Life's what you make it,  
So let's make it rock,  
Life's what you make it,  
So come on, come on, (Everybody Now)!  
Let's celebrate it,  
Join in everyone,  
You decide,  
Cause life's,  
What you make it  
  
[Bridge:]  
Things are looking up,  
Anytime you want,  
All you gotta do is realize that,  
It's under your control,  
So let the good times rock and roll!  
  
D-d-d-do it now!  
  
Aaaaaah!  
  
Alright!  
  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
  
Yeah! Yeah!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Life's what you make it,  
So let's make it rock,  
Life's what you make it,  
So come on, come on, (Everybody Now)!  
Let's celebrate it,  
Join in everyone,  
You decide,  
Cause life's,  
What you make it  
  
Life is what you make it!
