You wan'da step into my world  
It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss  
You've been delayed in the real world  
How many times have you hit and missed?  
Your cat-scan shows disfiguration  
I want to laugh myself to death  
With a misfired synapse  
With a bent configuration  
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath  
You want to talk to me  
So talk to me  
You want to talk to me (7x)  
You can't talk to me  
You don't understand your sex  
You ain't been mindfucked yet  
  
Let's do it (3x)  
Oh my distorted smile  
  
Guess what I'm doing now
