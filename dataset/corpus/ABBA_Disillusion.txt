Changing, moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling, laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice, I know what it means  
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try  
You're all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have
