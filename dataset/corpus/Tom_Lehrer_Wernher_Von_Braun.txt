And what is it that put America in the forefront of the nuclear nations? And
what is it that will make it possible to spend twenty billion dollars of your
money to put some clown on the moon? Well, it was good old American know how,
that's what, as provided by good old Americans like Dr. Wernher von Braun!  
  
Gather 'round while I sing you of Wernher von Braun,  
A man whose allegiance  
Is ruled by expedience.  
Call him a Nazi, he won't even frown,  
"Ha, Nazi, Schmazi," says Wernher von Braun.  
  
Don't say that he's hypocritical,  
Say rather that he's apolitical.  
"Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?  
That's not my department," says Wernher von Braun.  
  
Some have harsh words for this man of renown,  
But some think our attitude  
Should be one of gratitude,  
Like the widows and cripples in old London town,  
Who owe their large pensions to Wernher von Braun.  
  
You too may be a big hero,  
Once you've learned to count backwards to zero.  
"In German oder English I know how to count down,  
Und I'm learning Chinese!" says Wernher von Braun.
