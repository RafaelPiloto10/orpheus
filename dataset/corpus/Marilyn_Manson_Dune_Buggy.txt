Dune Buggy  
They'd mount machine guns on top of the dune buggies  
And the girls would drive the dune buggy while the guys shot the machine gun  
We'd swoop down on the town and kill everyone that wasn't beautiful  
  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out  
Dog god, bites my face  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out by the roots  
From my skull  
Goddamn toilet washes me away  
Cuze I am the Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
  
Trippin this trippin this  
Trippin this trippin this  
Trippin that  
Smile like, a cheshire cat  
Get it out get it out  
Get it out get it out  
Get it out of your skull  
You're just a doll  
I make sometimes to play  
  
Take me down now  
Hole in the ground  
The little girls think  
That I'm so sweet  
Mocked up and down  
Heart like a ghost town  
Spirits of the world  
Cower at my feet  
  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out  
Dog god, bites my face  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out  
Goddamn toilet washes me away  
Cuze I am the Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
  
I am the Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
I am the Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how
