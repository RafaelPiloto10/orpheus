Oh, baby -- this is the land of danger (each and every home a battlefield)  
Oh, baby -- this is the throat of a stranger (searching for the blood  
That's now congealed)  
Oh, baby -- this is a thick muddy mystery (tearing at the pages of our past)  
Oh, baby -- this is the straight path of history (human motion -- land and  
Ocean)  
Try to run, try to hide  
It's been a long, long, long, long long, long [long] time  
[It's been a long, long, long, long, long time]  
Oh, baby -- this is the fresh flesh of anger (calling out for action in the  
Streets)  
Oh, baby -- this is a slow running canker (opened up by victories and defeats)  
Oh, baby -- this is the night of the dancer (dancing on a time bomb in my
head)  
Oh, baby -- this is the ultimate cancer (human notion -- fear in motion)  
Try to run, try to hide  
It's been a long, long, long, long long, long [long] time  
[It's been a long, long, long, long, long time]  
[Don't tell me everything's gonna work out anymore  
Don't tell me everything's gonna work out anymore]  
[Of danger, of danger, of danger, of danger]  
[Don't tell me everything's gonna work out]
