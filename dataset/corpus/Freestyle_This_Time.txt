  
Oh I'm sorry girl,  
For causing you much pain,  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
Make your efforts all in vain  
And I apologize  
For all the things I've done  
You were loving me so much,  
But, all I did was let you down  
  
Oh I really don't know  
Just what to say  
All I know is that  
I want you to stay  
  
Chorus:  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let you slip away  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let another day go by  
Without holding you so tight,  
Without treating you so right  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let go of your love  
This time I promise you  
That we'll rise above it all  
And I will never let you fall,  
I'm gonna give you my all,  
This time...  
  
Oh I never thought,  
That I was hurting you  
Now I know that I was wrong  
Now I know just what to do  
Gonna try to be  
The best that I could be  
All I need is one more chance  
To make it up to you, you'll see...  
  
And there's one more thing  
That you ought to know  
All I know is that  
I don't want you to go.....
