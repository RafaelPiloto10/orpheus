Make your mind up  
Who's going to think for you?  
When the time comes  
You'll have to see it through  
Use your instinct  
And take a risk or two  
Don't you worry  
'Cause you'll know what to do  
  
You can give so  
Much to me  
But I don't want it  
I will be free  
  
For the last time  
I'm going out the door  
You don't need me  
To help you anymore  
Eyes wide open  
I see it's different now  
Keep your comfort  
I'll get along somehow  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Breakdown  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Nothing good comes easily  
Count the cost, I will be free  
You can scream and disagree  
I don't want it - I will be free  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Nothing good comes easily  
Count the cost, I will be free  
You can scream and disagree  
I don't want it, I will be free
