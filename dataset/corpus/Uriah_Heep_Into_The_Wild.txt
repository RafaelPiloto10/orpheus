Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
The troopers are coming,  
They want me dead not alive,  
Gonna run in the danger,  
When they open fire.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home.  
Don't cry,  
Little sister  
  
In the cold hearted winter,  
Dogs are running at my back,  
The nightmare is coming in,  
And I'm on this frozen track.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
If you think I'm guilty  
And I'm just a gambling man  
Well no one is above the law,  
I'm gonna have to make a stand.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home.  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Across the land,  
They're getting closer.  
I keep my ear to the ground  
They ride me down,  
Got no mercy  
But I never will be found  
Oh little sister,  
Don't you cry,  
You know I cannot stay  
I gotta find a place,  
A place to hide  
'Cos the blood hounds know my way  
  
It's the same old lies,  
Don't believe what you hear about me  
I'm gonna fight 'till it's over,  
And face that hanging tree  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home  
Don't cry  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Into the wild
