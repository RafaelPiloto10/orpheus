Mmmm...You're so pretty  
Not to talk to you would be a crime  
Let me put my arms around you  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And I'm going...  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Won't you be my girl?  
  
You're eyes, they're so pretty  
The clothes you wear, so fine  
Won't you come around to my place  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And I'm going...  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
  
Won't you be my girl?  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
Baby baby baby  
Won't you be my girl?
