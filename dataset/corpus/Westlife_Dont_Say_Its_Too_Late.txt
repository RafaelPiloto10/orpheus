It doesn't take much to learn  
when the bridges that you burn,  
Leave you stranded feeling alone  
It doesn't take much to cry,  
when you're living in a lie,  
And deceiving that someone who cares  
If I could turn back the time  
I would put you first in my life  
  
And I would risk it all for you,  
to prove my love is true,  
I'll build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you,  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me what's the deal,  
Don't say, don't say it's too late  
  
And now, the hills are getting hard to climb,  
I'm runnin' out of time,  
my decisions are pending on you,  
And I will accept the blame  
for burnin' out the flame  
Hoping the story will twist once again,  
If I could turn back the time  
I would put you first in my life  
  
And I would risk it all for you,  
to prove my love is true,  
I'll build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you,  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me what's the deal,  
Don't say, don't say it's too late  
  
Now I'm, layin' it all on the line, for you  
  
And I would risk it all for you,  
to prove my love is true,  
I'll build a wall around my heart  
that would only break a part for you,  
Can change the way I feel  
so tell me what's the deal,  
Don't say, don't say it's too late
