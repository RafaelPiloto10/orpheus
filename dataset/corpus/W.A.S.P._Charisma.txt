I've a breathe in minds of men  
No man's ever ruled the world  
With the lies I breath  
Vanity in the lust of men  
Not knowing the curse of me  
I'm some of the seven sins  
I'm the Alfa - omega man  
I'll show you who I am  
My soul has a dark embrace  
Hypnotic charm, mesmerizing face  
Till I'm your king  
A magic tongue, I'll seduce you all  
Till ya know my charisma  
Vatican Man  
I'm a liar blinding your vision  
Preaching fear and using religion  
I wrap myself in the American Flag  
With the bible and Koran  
And tell people I'm for which it stands  
Till you believe, till you know my charisma  
I'm coming back till you know I'm God  
I'm a fear from a shadow land  
I seduce you all  
Here I come new messiah man  
To bow to me, make me your God  
I got them all marching to the rhythm  
Believing me, oh yeah, their new religion  
I'm a racist with a waving flag  
  
I'm gonna be the new world leader  
Of domination with a fascist plan  
I got a lot of 9 millimeter baby eaters  
I'm coming back til you know I'm God  
Till you belive, till you know I'm charisma  
Charisma - do you know my name  
I'm the God that you pray  
Charisma - are you idolizing me?  
When you worship my name  
I'm a dangerous thing  
Your new messiah's me
