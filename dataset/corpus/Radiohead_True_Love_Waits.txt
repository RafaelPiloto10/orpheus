I'll drown my beliefs  
To have you be in peace  
I'll dress like your niece  
And wash your swollen feet  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
I'm not living,  
I'm just killing time  
Your tiny hands  
Your crazy-kitten smile  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
And true love waits  
In haunted attics  
And true love lives  
On lollipops and crisps  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave
