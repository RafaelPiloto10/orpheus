Armed with wealth and good health  
The best of health  
In the future when all's well  
I will lie down and be counted  
In the future when all's well  
  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
Lee, please stand up and defend me  
In the future when all's well  
Confront what you are afraid of  
In the future when all's well  
  
Every day I play a sad game called  
In the future when all's well  
Living longer than I had intended  
Something must have gone...right!  
  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
Lee, please stand up and defend me  
In the future when all's well  
Confront what you are afraid of  
In the future when all's well  
  
Hold me closely if your will allows it  
In the future when all's well  
Paired-off, pawed, till I can barely stand it  
The future is ended by a long, long sleep  
The future is ended by a long, long sleep  
The future is ended by a long sleep
