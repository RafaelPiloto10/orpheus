A quarter after two  
Sittin' in my car, watching  
Waiting on a train  
Ninety-seven flatcars  
Loaded down with troop trucks and tanks  
Rolling by  
  
I'm twenty-one, and I'm scared as hell  
I quit school, I'm healthy as a horse  
Because of all that I'll be the first one to die in a war  
  
The whole damn town was sleeping  
Dreaming the same dream  
The radio was playing  
Roger McWilliams singing  
"To each and every thing there's a time and a season  
  
I'm twenty-one, and I'm scared as hell  
I quit school, I'm healthy as a horse  
Because of all that I'll be the first one to die in a war  
  
Yes, I have the right to say  
We all die anyway  
But I'd just like to know  
Where does my time go
