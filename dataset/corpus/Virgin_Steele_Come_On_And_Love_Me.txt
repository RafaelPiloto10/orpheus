The night is hot and so am I  
Darling feel the heat between my thighs  
You're a perfect angel sweet seventeen  
Moist and pink and hotter in between  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, love me  
Come on, take me home  
Bring it back, bring it back to life  
  
Give all your love to me girl!  
I'm Dave the lion, roar till I die  
I kiss the girls and then make them cry...  
With pleasure!  
  
I taste your lips, you drink my love  
It's a vintage year honey, '69  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips me I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]
