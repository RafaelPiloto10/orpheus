The Scene  
(Graham Russell, Mark Towner Williams, Cliff Rehrig)  
It's another lovely day  
Are we still so far away  
And how can I share it with you  
It's not easy to believe  
Are we both about to leave  
Without ever saying, I do  
I still love you  
(Chorus)  
Just make me part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene  
I don't want to hear it, I just couldn't bear it  
If things weren't as good as they seem  
You can say I'm not the one  
That a lot of faith has gone  
The bridges were never quite crossed  
Every grain of truth, we deny or prove  
Is somewhere before it gets lost  
And is found again  
(Repeat Chorus)  
What if these feelings are all in my head  
Flying around me in a world of their own  
What if there's nothing that needs to be said  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Just say we're part of the scene
