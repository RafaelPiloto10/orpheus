Well you thought it was over  
But that's not what she told me today  
She said you and your pride  
Man, you let it get in the way  
And if things weren't bad enough  
Well, she told me you were taking  
Her love for granted, oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
Again  
  
Well you're in need of a friend  
And believe me now I happen to be one  
We can sit and pretend  
But I know a good thing when I see one  
Go to her and admit you were wrong  
She'll be there 'cause she knows you belong together  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Go to her and admit you were wrong  
She'll be there 'cause she knows you belong together  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, she wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She said she wants you back again  
  
Chorus
