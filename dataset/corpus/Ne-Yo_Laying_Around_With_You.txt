What I wouldn't give to wrestle over the remote control  
What I wouldn't give to hit you harder than you thought I could with the
pillow  
And we stop just for a second because you got a feather in your eye (eye)  
I get it out and you kiss me I smile and then we get back to our pillow fight  
Now that sounds like fun  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
Oh what I wouldn't give to cook you dinner from the microwave  
And what I wouldn't give to burn the popcorn and hear you tell me, "baby
that's okay"  
Baby that's okay  
Then you leave to go to the store and it's almost too much for me  
Though I know it'll only be a minute  
Then you come back through the door with a bag of all the foods that we're not
supposed to eat  
Now tonight that can't be beat  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
I want to be in your arms where no harm could ever come my way  
I want to be where you are oh near or far every night and day oh  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice (said I wouldn't notice)  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end (wouldn't bother
us)  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice (wouldn't notice)  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end (world came to an
end)  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
When I'm laying around with you  
No, no, no when I'm laying around with you
