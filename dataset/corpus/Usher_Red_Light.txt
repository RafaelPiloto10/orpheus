It's crazy  
I can't believe that you  
Would be the one to do  
Do me like you do  
Get back here baby  
  
Girl you let me  
Have my way and I was thinking I could get it again  
Baby we could be friends if you only(ssh)  
And you show me  
Just how quick your tires could spin  
You were off in the wind  
Tell me were did you go  
  
When you left (oh)  
I'm thinking which way did she go  
I should have known that you would lead me on girl  
I'm in the wind on cruise control  
I gotta be dreaming 'cause I never felt like this before  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It was supposed to be  
Just a one night  
In and out and I'm out the door  
But she's got me sitting here  
At the red light  
Driving round looking out for her  
  
Now its raining  
And I'm looking over at the passenger side  
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off  
She was stopping and dropping me  
Switching from fast to slow  
But that ain't have nothing on how you got  
When I got you home  
  
When you left (oh)  
I'm thinking which way did she go  
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall  
I'm in the wind on cruise control  
I'm searching for you cause I can't seem to let you go  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You know  
I really only thought  
That this would be a one night stand  
What you doing to me  
Come on  
What you doing to me  
  
Maybe(maybe)  
She's running home to someone else(someone else)  
Or maybe(or maybe)  
She lost my number in her cell  
(oh babe)  
(what you doing to me)  
Or maybe(or maybe)  
She's never done like this before  
Cause I can't see (can't see)  
Her not coming back for more  
More  
  
[Chorus: x4]
