When the rose.  
Slaps your face  
Says your pain is a state of grace (I think that's right)  
Mirror cracks  
Image bleeds  
He'll touch your desires  
But not your needs  
  
I stand at an open window  
I see everything there is to see  
I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
Party ends  
On the floor  
Hear a voice  
Behind the door  
In the dark  
You play his games  
Forget yourself  
Forget your name  
  
I stand at an open window  
I see everything there is to see  
I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
So there you are all dressed in black  
Walk away and don't look back  
But if you must then cast a stone  
The light is on but there's nothing and no one home (I think)  
  
Cos I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taiking you  
I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
I said I I've been watching you  
Isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
I've been watching you  
Isn't true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you down.
