We were walking in paradise, never did notice.  
Blind in the Buddha land, looking for solace.  
We had been told of a place,  
Far beyond this vale of tears.  
We could never have guessed,  
We were already blessed.  
There we were, where we are in the garden.  
  
Didn't we climb on up Er Mei, temple to temple?  
Yes and all and all along the way,  
The day was simple.  
Didn't we reach the top, didn't we gain our goal?  
Did we finally stop, surprised by the cold?  
  
We were walking in paradise, never did tumble.  
Blind in the Buddha land, looking for trouble.  
We had been told of a place  
Far beyond this vale of tears.  
We could never have guessed,  
We were already blessed.  
There we were, where we are,  
In the garden, in the garden.
