In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb  
I didn't know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed  
A street sweeper came whistlin' by  
He was bouncin' every step  
It seemed strange how good he felt  
So I asked him while he swept  
  
He said "It's my job to be cleaning up this mess  
And that's enough reason to go for me  
It's my job to be better than the rest  
And that makes the day for me"  
  
Got an uncle who owns a bank he's a self made millionaire  
He never had anyone to love never had no one to care  
He always to seemed kind of sad to me  
So I asked him why that was  
And he told me it's because in my contract there's a clause  
That says "It's my job to worried half to death  
And that's the thing people respect in me  
It's a job but without it I'd be less  
Than what I expect from me"  
  
I've been lazy most all of my life  
Writing songs and sleeping late  
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake  
If street sweepers can smile then  
I've got no right to feel upset  
But sometimes I still forget  
Till the lights go on and the stage is set  
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat  
  
It's my job to be different than the rest  
and that's enough reason to go for me  
It's my job to be better than the best  
and that's a tough break for me  
It's my job to be cleaning up this mess  
and that's enough reason to go for me  
  
It's my job to be better than the best  
and that makes the day for me
