Under suburban skies  
Where life is bleeding  
Where concrete skies are grey  
There's plenty of room for dreaming  
  
I still keep coming here  
Follow those traces  
I travel back in time  
Remember all those places  
Feels like I never left  
The house's still standing  
Down by the river where  
The dreams are never ending  
  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me by the river  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me where the river flows  
  
Under the silent moon  
This industrial city  
Is heartland even though  
Life's been not that pretty  
I still keep coming here  
To that old river  
To find my roots just where  
The future lives forever  
  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me by the river  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me, you can find me  
By the river where dreams will never die  
By the river under suburban skies  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me by the river  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me where the river flows  
By the river where dreams have never died  
By the river I look through children's eyes  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me by the river  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me where the river flows  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me by the river  
You find me  
You find me  
You find me where the river flows  
Where the river flows  
Where the river flows  
Where the river flows
