I'm a punk get off my ass  
Because I'm fucking working class  
I get up everyday and go to work  
I'm treated like a fucking jerk  
They suck my money every week  
Now my future's looking bleak  
They say the money's almost gone  
But what will I do when my time comes  
  
Hey! hey! hey!  
  
Blue collar job you and I  
Kiss your hard-earned dough goodbye  
Soon you'll be old you'll be gray  
And how will you earn your pay  
For over 40 years you broke your back  
But they gave your money to some bum on crack  
They say we won't get it  
But fucking the government's leeches are still money sucking  
  
Hey! hey! hey!  
  
Did you hear what they want to do to you and me  
They want to take away our social security
