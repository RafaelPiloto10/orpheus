They call me Mr. Knowitall  
I will not compromise.  
I will not be told what to do.  
I shall not step aside.  
  
They call me Mr. Knowitall  
I have no time to waste.  
My mouth it spews pure intellect.  
And I've such elegant taste.  
  
They call me Mr. Knowitall.  
I sup the aged wine.  
Oh I could tell such wonderous tales  
If I should find the time.  
  
I must be Mr. Knowitall  
For ideas they come in bounds.  
I am Mr. Knowitall  
So spread the word around.  
They call me Mr. Knowitall  
  
I am so eloquent.  
Perfection is my middle name  
And whatever rhymes with eloquent.
