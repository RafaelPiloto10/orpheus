Drake:  
I got my eyes on you  
You're everything that I see  
I want your hot love, emotion endlessly  
I can't get over you, left your mark on me  
I want your hot love, emotion endlessly  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on, we're goin' home  
Just hold on, we're goin' home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on, we're goin' home, home  
  
Jhene:  
What's up  
Been a minute since we kicked it  
You been caught up  
With these chicks and I don't get it, you're a star love  
You shouldn't have to deal with that  
I never make you feel like that  
Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us  
That's why you trust me  
You been through more than most of us  
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?  
Darlin' you, you give but you cannot take love.  
  
Drake:  
I needed to hear that, I hate when you're submissive  
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance  
I look around the peers that surround me, these boys are trippin'  
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different  
Started realizin' a couple places I could take it  
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement  
I want to take it deeper than money, vacation  
And influence a generation that's lackin' in patience  
I've been dealin' with my dad, speakin' of lack of patience  
Just me and my old man gettin' back to basics  
We've been talkin' 'bout the future and time that we wasted  
When he put that bottle down, girl that man is amazin'  
Well, we had a couple Coronas  
We might have rolled a white paper, just somethin' to hold us  
We even talked about you in our couple of moments  
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups  
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone  
Lookin' like you came from the 70's on your own  
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is  
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?  
You don't even know what you want from love anymore  
I search for somethin' I'm missin', it disappear when I'm bored  
But girl, what qualities was I lookin' for before?  
Who you settlin' for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  
  
Jhene:  
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us  
  
Drake:  
I love me enough for the both of us  
  
Jhene:  
That's why you trust me  
I know you been through more than most of us  
  
Drake:  
Talk to me baby  
  
Jhene:  
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?  
  
Drake:  
What are you so afraid of?  
  
Jhene:  
Darlin' you, you give but you cannot take love.  
  
Drake:  
Give but you cannot take love.  
  
Jhene:  
You cannot take love  
  
Drake:  
You need you some of this Drake love  
  
Jhene:  
None of that fake love  
  
Drake:  
Turn on to commercial break love  
So that we can make love
