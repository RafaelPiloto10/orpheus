I know he's driving a fancy car  
When you're with him  
You're feeling like a star  
But when I'm home alone I think only of you  
So what do you know  
How does it go  
  
So how can he buy a love that's not for sale  
If you two were so in love I couldn't tell, baby  
Girl, but when I'm home alone I hear your heart, it spells  
You gotta know  
And how does it go  
  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
Oh yeah  
  
So let's take some time out to find a way  
Cuz there are just so many things I need to say  
(So many things I need to say)  
Cause when the lights are down and love is in the air  
And I need to know  
Do you really care  
(Do you really care baby)  
  
Who do you love (tell me who do you love)  
Who do you love  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love (oh yeah)  
Who do you love  
Oh yeah  
  
Girl I find just I can't leave you alone  
(Ain't nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong)  
I promise I will make it back home  
And if you're ever in need  
Put your full trust in me  
And I will never leave you at home  
  
Who do you love (tell me who, yeah)  
Who do you love (I need to know baby)  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
  
Who do you love
