Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found,  
Was blind, but now, I see.  
  
T'was Grace that taught  
My heart to fear.  
And Grace, my fears relieved.  
How precious did that Grace appear  
The hour I first believed.  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
We have already come.  
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far  
And Grace will lead us home.  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures.  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures.  
  
When we've been here a thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun.  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Then when we've first begun.  
  
"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found,  
Was blind, but now, I see.
