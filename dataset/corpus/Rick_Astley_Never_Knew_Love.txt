Your love is warm as a ray of sun  
Touching me when the morning comes  
So lucky am I to have you by my side  
Forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Never knew love could feel this way  
Never knew love could do this to me  
Never knew love could feel this way  
Never knew love could do this to me  
  
Thought I had it all in the palm of my hand  
Darkness had fallen on me and I didn't quite understand  
Then came you you brightened up my days yeah  
Forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I know  
Never knew love never knew love  
Could feel this way  
Could do this to me  
Could feel this way  
Could do this to me  
I never knew your love  
Could do this to me  
Could feel this way  
  
[Chorus]
