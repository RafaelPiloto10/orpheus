Hey I was just a skinny lad  
Never knew no good from bad  
But I knew life before I left my nursery - huh  
Left alone with big fat Fanny  
She was such a naughty nanny  
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me  
Hey hey!

Across the wire across the land

But their beauty and their style  
Went kind of smooth after a while  
Take me to them dirty ladies every time

Oh but I still get my pleasure  
Still get my greatest treasure
