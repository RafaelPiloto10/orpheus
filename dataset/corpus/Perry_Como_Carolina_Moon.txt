The moon was shining bright in Carolina  
The night we said goodbye so tenderly  
And now that I'm away from Carolina  
Won't somebody tell the moon for me:  
  
Oh, Carolina Moon keep shining  
Shining on the one who waits for me  
Carolina Moon, I'm pining  
Pining for the place I long to be  
  
How I'm hopin' tonight you'll go  
Go to the right window  
Scatter your light  
Say I'm all right please do!  
  
Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon!  
  
Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon!
