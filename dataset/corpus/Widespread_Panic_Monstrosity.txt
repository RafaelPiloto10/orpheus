If we followed your warning signs  
Children would swim alphabetically  
Mountaintops would all fall in line  
Single-file by height  
If this was the only way, daydreaming would stop at 5 o'clock  
And the corner(?) flashes off from left to right  
  
Lies, lies  
You don't always get your way  
  
Saturday, slow to wake, Bugs Bunny love  
Thought those people would never go home, guess it's the price we pay  
If everyday were Saturday  
Oh, most people couldn't even go it alone  
  
Lies, lies  
We don't always get our ways  
  
Oh, and it's time, time to sleep  
Nightdreaming starts with hands held high  
Maybe then we'll finally turn it on  
Like a brand new (?)  
  
Lies, lies  
We don't always get our ways  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Gentle  
Fragile
