Softly the light shines in through  
The gates of grace on me and you  
Deceiving our restless hearts  
A flickering flame so serene  
Devours the night so we could see  
The fear we hold on to so strong  
  
But I know where I belong  
Away from your gods  
That heal all wounds  
And light this endless dark  
  
Lonely the light shines on you  
Through the gates of fire entombed  
Feeding on your love  
Weak is the blaze that kept me away  
From cruelty and tenderness embraced  
Saving my soul no more  
  
And I know where I belong  
Away from your gods  
That heal all wounds and light this endless dark  
That shine on you and tame your burning heart  
That bury my truth right into your arms  
That worship the tomb of our forlorn love
