Where will you be when the sky comes down?  
And what would you do if the strength was found?  
Stand right beside me when the ground starts shaking  
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking  
If there is one thing I can promise you  
We'll see the light again  
  
This is the calm before the coming storm  
This is the red sky morning  
Without warning now  
This is the fight that we've been waiting for  
And there's no sense in running  
The hammer's coming down,  
The hammer's coming  
  
Once it's started, there's no turning back  
And I'll be with you when the sun turns black  
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest  
When you're standing in the heart of darkness  
If there is one thing I can promise you  
We'll see the light again  
  
This is the calm before the coming storm  
This is the red sky morning  
Without warning now  
This is the fight that we've been waiting for  
And there's no sense in running  
The hammer's coming down,  
The hammer's coming  
  
Holding on  
We'll make it till the dawn  
It'll be here before long  
Holding on  
If we can find the light  
We can make our way back home  
  
Holding on  
We'll make it till the dawn  
It'll be here before long  
Holding on  
If we can find the light  
We'll find the light come on  
We'll find the light come on  
Hold on  
If we can find the light  
We'll find the light come on  
We'll find the light come on
