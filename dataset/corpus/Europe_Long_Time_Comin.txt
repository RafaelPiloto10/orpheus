We're gonna rock so hard, we're gonna let it go  
If ya want it loud, hey let me know  
It's been a while since we've been gone  
We had it tough, now the hurt is gone  
Well, when the day is done, when the day is through  
Listen close this is what we'll do  
Comin' down like a ton of lead,  
Like a ton of lead that's what I said  
It's been a long time comin'...  
Hey, you can tear us up, tear us down  
Before too long we'll be back around  
Fallin' in, fallin' out  
Well this time around there ain't no doubt  
We'll walk on through the break of day  
Once again we'll be on our way  
Ain't no time to wonder why  
Just try to keep the drive alive  
It's been a long time comin'...
