Sail on  
When the water gets high  
Sail on  
When the wind starts to die  
Sail on  
It's just a matter of minutes  
Till His ship comes to get us  
And we'll all get in it  
  
When we're all born  
We set out to sea  
Looking for answers continuously  
Then when we find out  
To Him we belong  
We watch for the signs  
And keep sailing on  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Cast up your sails  
And let the wind blow  
Jesus will never  
Let your ship lose control  
Just keep your compass set on the Son  
And He'll guide you safely  
To His beautiful Home  
  
We can't afford to throw our lives  
To the wind  
To the wind  
We've got the Lord  
In control of our ship  
And He'll guide us safely in  
He'll guide us in  
  
[Chorus:]
