Where are the new rebels  
We didn't ask for this  
Trying to be something different  
We will fight the bigots  
Fight them with our reason  
Fight them with our constancy  
  
[Chorus]  
River, our river, let it flow  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow  
River, river, let it flow  
This is our reason  
Let it grow  
Don't keep looking back  
Living in the past  
Never built a golden future. Have,  
Have faith in the species  
We've come to far to fail  
I don't believe in our extinction  
Everyone of us  
Has got to take it on  
Don't build a dam on evolution. There,  
There are those who'd like us  
To cling on to the past  
Wallowing in their past glories  
River, (don't)  
Our river, (don't look back)  
Let it flow (we might fall)  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow (have faith in the future)  
River, (don't)  
River, (don't look back)  
Let it flow (we might fall)  
This is our reason  
Let it grow
