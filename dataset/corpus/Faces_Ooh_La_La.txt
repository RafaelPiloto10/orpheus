Poor old granddad  
I laughed at all his words  
I thought he was a bitter man  
He spoke of woman's ways  
  
They'll trap you, then they use you  
Before you even know  
For love is blind and you're far too kind  
Don't ever let it show  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger.  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger.  
  
The can can's such a pretty show  
They'll steal your heart away  
But backstage, back on earth again  
The dressing rooms are gray  
  
They come on strong and it ain't too long  
Before they make you feel a man  
But love is blind and you soon will find  
You're just a boy again  
  
When you want her lips, you get a cheek  
Makes you wonder where you are  
If you want some more and she's fast asleep  
Then she's twinkling with the stars.  
  
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say  
You'll have to learn, just like me  
And that's the hardest way  
Ooh la la  
  
[Chorus]
