Want to fuck off, drop out  
Never trust a fuckin' hippie  
For that matter don't trust anyone  
  
Quit school, don't work  
Livin' up the music you punk  
If I could do it so could anyone  
  
Drugs are good  
They make you do things that you know you not should  
And when you do them people think that you're cool  
And when you do them people think that you're cool  
  
Want to join a punk band  
Shave your head and get a tattoo  
You don't need talent just the attitude  
  
Self destruction  
For no particular reason beat up everyone  
  
Drugs are neat  
And you can buy them relatively cheap  
And when you do them people think that you're cool  
And when you do them people think that you're cool
