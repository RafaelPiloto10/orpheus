If I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
If I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
I'd like to whisper  
Whisper sweet nothings in your ear  
Nothings that were meant  
For my love alone to hear  
  
If I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
If I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
I'd like to whisper  
Whisper sweet nothings in your ear  
Nothings that were meant  
For my love alone to hear  
  
And if I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
And if I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
Do you mind  
Mmm, do you mind  
If I say I love you  
Do you mind
