Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely  
Standing on the corner feeling blue  
Sweethearts out for fun  
Pass me one by one  
Guess I'll wind up like I always do  
With only  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue  
Me and my shadow  
Not a soul to tell our troubles to  
And when it's twelve o'clock  
We climb the stair  
We never knock  
For nobody's there  
Just me and my shadow  
All alone and feeling blue  
When the sun sets on the far horizon  
And the parlor lamps begin to glow  
Jim and Jack and John  
Put their slippers on  
They're all set but we'restill on the go  
So lonely  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue  
Me and my shadow  
Not a soul to tell our troubles to  
And when it's twelve o'clock  
We climb the stair  
We never knock  
For nobody's there  
Just me and my shadow  
All alone and feeling blue.
