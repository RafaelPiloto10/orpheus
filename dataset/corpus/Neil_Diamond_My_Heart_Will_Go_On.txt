Every night in my dreams  
I see you, I feel you  
That is how I know you go on  
Far across the distance  
And spaces between us  
You have come to show you go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Love can touch us one time  
And last for a lifetime  
And never let go till we're gone  
Love was when I loved you  
One true time to hold to  
In my life we'll always go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
You're here  
There's nothing I fear  
'Cause I know that my heart  
Will go on and on  
And on and on and on  
My heart will go on and on
