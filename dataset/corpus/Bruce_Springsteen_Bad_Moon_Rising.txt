I see a bad moon rising  
I see troubles on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightning  
I see bad times today  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'  
I know the end it's coming soon  
I fear rivers overflowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Hope you got your things together  
Hope you're quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise
