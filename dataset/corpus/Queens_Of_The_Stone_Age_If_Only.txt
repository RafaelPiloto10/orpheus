If it gets you down well then I'll take it  
If it gets you up well I don't want it  
It let you down so broken-hearted  
If it gets you down well then I want it  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all  
  
So blow our mind and make it lazy  
Those long, long days with no escaping  
I hold the wheel to let it go  
Don't want to stop, don't want to know  
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all
