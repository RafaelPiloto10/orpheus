I knew he was different, in his sexuality  
I went to his parties, as a straight minority  
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity  
He only introduced me to a wider reality  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that he was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But he's nobody's  
  
Hero - saves a drowning child  
Cures a wasting disease  
Hero - lands the crippled airplane  
Solves great mysteries  
  
Hero - not the handsome actor  
Who plays a hero's role  
Hero - not the glamor girl  
Who'd love to sell her soul  
If anybody's buying  
Nobody's hero  
  
I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family  
All their lives were shattered  
In a nightmare of brutality  
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony  
Try to hold some faith  
In the goodness of humanity  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that she was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But she's nobody's  
  
Hero - the voice of reason  
Against the howling mob  
Hero - the pride of purpose  
In the unrewarding job  
  
Hero - not the champion player  
Who plays the perfect game  
Not the glamor boy  
Who loves to sell his name  
Everybody's buying  
Nobody's hero  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that you were gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
  
Hero
