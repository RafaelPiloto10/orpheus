I know what I need I need you  
I can't see nothin' else all I can see is you  
I don't care what they say about my state of mind  
I know what's good for me and you are just my kind  
We are animals We are animals We are animals We are animals  
I know what I want I want you  
Shed your cloths forget your codes  
You know this is nothing new  
I smell your scent I taste your sweat  
I feel this passion too  
Let's trust our senses not our minds  
Lets break all the rules  
We are animals We are animals  
We are animals We are animals  
We are animals  
We are animals  
Come with me run with me leave this world behind  
Come to me come with me I know that we will find  
We are animals We are animals  
We are animals We are animals  
We are animals  
We are animals
