Oh what a love, that'll bind the wounds of a loss and heal my heart  
Oh what a love, to cast away the pain  
Oh what a love, that'll bear for me the cost of a brand new start  
Oh what a love, to let me begin again  
Oh what a life, that'll brighten up the corners of a lonely life  
Oh what a life, to cast away the rain  
Oh what a life to remove the gloom I face in the dark alone  
Oh what a life, I believe I can see again  
I remember the day  
We walked on the beach till sunset, then we sang  
And the songs we played were a promise of love that'll last beyond the grave  
Oh what a song, learned from the sea taught slowly to the young  
Oh what a song, to cast away the rain  
Oh what a song, to break the bonds of fear and still the sound  
Oh what a song, I believe I can sing again  
I remember the day we met at a place of hope, I took what you gave  
And the words we'd say were a promise of love that'll honor beyond the grave  
Chorus
