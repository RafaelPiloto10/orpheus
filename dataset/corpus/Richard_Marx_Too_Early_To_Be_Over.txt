With another day another life slips away  
And floats above the crowd  
You can only stay ahead of time when time co-operates  
Instead of heading south  
Cards are dealt  
You play what you hold  
You can't tell me the story's been told  
  
[Chorus: ]  
It's too early to be over  
And it's way past when  
It could be starting again  
It's too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Run down run around biting my tongue  
Hardly my sad tale  
But the rolling in and steppin' out  
Nothing but fun  
I finally had to bail  
Nothing worse than trying too hard  
This ain't this fool's first walk in the park  
  
It's too early to be over  
I don't feel a thing from the bone to the skin  
It's too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Somewhere out there it all evens out  
So they would have you believe  
But that don't get me  
That won't set me free  
  
It's too early to be over  
And it's way past when it could be starting over  
It's too early to be over  
Always the fave but I already gave  
  
[Chorus: ]
