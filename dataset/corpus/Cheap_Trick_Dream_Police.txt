The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
You know that talk is cheap  
And rumors ain't nice  
And when I fall asleep  
I don't think I'll survive  
  
The night the night  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
Well I can't tell lies  
'Cause they're listening to me  
And when I fall asleep  
Bet they're spying on me tonight,  
Tonight  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
I try to sleep  
They're wide awake  
They won't let me alone  
They don't get paid to take vacations  
Or let me alone  
They spy on me  
I try to hide  
They won't let me alone  
They persecute me  
They're the judge and jury all in one  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police they come  
To me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me  
  
The dream police (police, police)  
The dream police (police, police)
