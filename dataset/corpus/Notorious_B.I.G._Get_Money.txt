Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money  
  
You want to sip Mo' on my living room flo'  
Play Nintendo with Cease-a-Leo  
Pick up my phone say, "Poppa not home"  
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'  
Spin my V, smoke all my weed  
Tattoo on titty sayin' B-I-G, now check it  
You want to be my main squeeze, baby  
Don't cha, you want to gimme what I need, baby  
Won't cha, picture life as my wife, just think  
Full length mink, fat X and O links  
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that  
Showed you the safe combinations and all that  
Guess you could say you's the one I trusted  
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?  
Shit got hot, you sent Feds to my spot  
Took me to court, tried to take all I got  
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her  
"Damn, why she want to stick me for my paper?"  
My Mo-sci-no ho, my Ver-sa-ce hottie  
Come to find out, you was fuckin' everybody  
You knew about me, the fake ID  
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.  
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'  
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin'  
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four  
All you heard was, "Poppa, don't hit me no more"  
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial  
Fuck around and made her milk box material  
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips  
'Cause of you, I'm on some real fuck a bitch shit, uh  
  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
  
niggas betta grab a seat  
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep  
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet  
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite  
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down  
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound  
Now I'm Billboard now, niggas press to hit it  
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it  
Rather do the killin' than the stick up jooks  
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy  
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it  
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat  
Then, you want to be my main squeeze, nigga  
Don't cha, you want to lick between my knees, nigga  
Don't cha want to see me whippin' your three down the Ave.  
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad  
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air  
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere  
Me shifty? Now you want to pistol whip me  
Pull out your nine while I cock on mine  
Yeah, what, nigga? I ain't got time for this  
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit  
Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits  
Adia Vinadini and Chanel lime boots  
Things that make up for all the games and the lies  
Hallmark cards sayin', "I apologize"  
Is you wit' me? How could you ever deceive me  
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me  
Naw, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow  
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know  
  
Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money
