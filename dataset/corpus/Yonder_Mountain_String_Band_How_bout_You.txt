Don't tie me up and take my time  
Waiting years and wondering why  
I love old songs and what they know  
Just turn 'em up and let 'em go  
  
I ask myself what I need  
Homesick blues and melodies  
This old tune's what I desire  
It's hot as hell it burns like fire, burns like fire  
  
Chorus:  
How 'bout you? How 'bout you?  
I wonder where you're going to  
Flyin' by and out of view  
I'll keep looking, how 'bout you?  
  
I love old lights from the radio  
Nowadays I just don't know  
There's less and less for me to prove  
Just more folks to prove it to, to prove it to  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
Telephones won't let me be  
They never sound like what I need  
Up all night and listenin' to  
The things you say and never do, never do  
  
[ Chorus ]
