So many try to capture love  
And so many never do  
So many hearts are lost  
With never a clue.  
  
So many nights are passed  
in sorrow  
So many days go by  
So many lovers lose  
And never know why.  
  
Still the lovers in the  
backseats claw  
And still the wives wait up  
Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.  
  
All through the night  
We thrust and parry  
Letting our best sides show  
Then in the morning light  
We lie and let go.  
  
Everyone searching for somebody  
Someone to kiss and tell  
More often than not  
Our heavens turn into hell.  
  
Still the lovers in the  
backseats claw  
And still the wives wait up  
Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.  
  
So many try to capture love  
And so many never do  
So many hearts are lost  
With never a clue.  
  
Everyone searching for somebody  
Someone to kiss and tell  
More often than not  
Our heavens turn into hell.  
  
Still the lovers in the  
backseats claw  
And still the wives wait up  
Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.
