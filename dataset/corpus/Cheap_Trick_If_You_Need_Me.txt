Girl it's alright  
If it's one of those nights  
And you need me  
Swallow your pride  
And there's nothing to hide  
Do you need me?  
  
Such a long long time  
I've been waiting for a sign  
Say you need me  
I've been dreaming of the day  
When I hear you say  
Say you need me  
  
I believe in you, you believe in me  
But I can't feel it in my heart  
So what's wrong with you  
What's the matter with me  
And how come we're so far apart, yeah?  
  
I can stand a little hurt  
And I can stand a lot of pain  
Well now we can work it out alright  
If you need me yeah  
  
Can we be serious, can you keep a secret  
Hold it inside between you and I, can we keep it  
Been thinking of a way just to get you to say  
Say you need me  
  
I believe in you, you believe in me  
And I can't feel it in my heart  
So what's wrong with you  
What's the matter with me  
And how come we're so far apart yeah?  
  
I can stand a little hurt  
And I can stand a lot of pain  
Well now we can work it out alright  
If you need me yeah

That we don't have to let it go
