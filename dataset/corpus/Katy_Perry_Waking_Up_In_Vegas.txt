You gotta help me out  
It's all a blur last night  
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke  
I lost my fake id but you lost the motel key  
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks  
Now don't blame me  
You roll the cash out  
And get the hell out of town  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Why are these lights so bright  
Oh, did we get hitched last night, dressed up like Elvis,  
Why, am I wearing your class ring?  
Don't call your mother  
Cause now we're partners in crime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You got me into this  
Information overload, situation lost control  
Send out an S.O.S.  
And get some cash out  
We're gonna tear up the town  
  
Don't be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Told me, you told me, you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
That's what you get baby, shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter  
Give me some cash out, baby  
Give me some cash out, baby
