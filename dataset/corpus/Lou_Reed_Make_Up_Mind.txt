I can't seem to make up my mind  
I can't tell the colors  
That will fit this room  
I can't tell a thing about you  
Make up my mind  
  
I can't seem to make up my mind  
Are you laughing at me  
Or telling a joke?  
The cigarette on the sheet  
Begins to smoke  
Make up your mind  
  
Right or left, up or down  
In or out, straight or round  
Love or lust, rain or shine  
I can't seem to make up my poor mind  
  
I can't seem to make up my mind  
I can't tell the difference between wrong and right  
Are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight?  
  
Leaving me behind  
Leaving me behind  
Why don't you make up your mind  
(I can't seem to make up my mind)  
About leaving me, baby?  
(I can't seem to make up my mind)  
(I can't seem to make up my mind)  
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
