[Britney Spears]  
I love to love ya  
  
I can't stop dreaming about you  
Your eyes make me melt away into the day  
One kiss on my neck drives me crazy (crazy!)  
One touch leads you close enough  
For you I crave  
  
Ain't got a worry in the world  
Ain't got nothin' to care about  
When you're around I can't be down  
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothing  
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky!)  
Ain't gotta ever ask me why  
When you're around there aint no doubt  
You aint gotta hold me back just let me  
  
[Hook:]  
Go (go)  
Watch me get down and  
Go (go)  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
Go (go)  
Watch me go down and  
Go (go)  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
I just can't help myself (yeah)  
  
I can't live one day without you  
No stopping the way I feel it's so surreal  
Make me go ahh boy I lose it  
I just can't control myself it's so intense  
  
Ain't got a worry in the world  
Ain't got nothin' to care about  
When you're around I can't be down  
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'  
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)  
Ain't gotta ever ask me why  
  
When you're around there aint no doubt  
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me  
  
[Hook:]  
Go (go)  
Watch me get down and  
Go (go)  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
Go (go)  
Watch me go down and  
Go (go)  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
  
I wanna hold you wherever you are  
There aint no time that's wrong  
Aint no place that's too far  
Not a care in the world  
Just for you, just for me  
Where a boy loves a girl and that girl  
That girl is me  
  
Ain't got a worry in the world  
Ain't got nothin' to care about  
When you're around I can't be down  
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'  
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)  
Ain't gotta ever ask me why  
When you're around there aint no doubt  
You aint gotta hold me back just let me  
  
[Hook:]  
Go (go)  
Watch me get down and  
Go (go)  
When I come around just let me go
