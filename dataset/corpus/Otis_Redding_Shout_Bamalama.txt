Shout bamalama  
  
He's down in alabama  
Shoutin' bamalama  
Way down in louisana  
Well, well, well  
Nobody's gonna set him down  
  
Lord have mercy on my soul  
How many chickens have I stole  
One last night and the night before  
I'm going back and tryin' to get 10, 11 more  
Startin' to get 'em and I  
  
I love a chicken, baby  
Shoutin' bamalama  
Well, well, well  
Nobody's gonna set him down  
  
9 feet, 10 feet we're goin' for the build  
9 feet left on a 10 feet of hill  
10 feet turn around a 9 feet fence  
His teeth fell out, but his tongue stayed in  
It's gettin' said so  
  
He got the chicken, baby  
Shoutin' bamalama  
Well, well, well  
Nobody's gonna set him down  
  
Leo demarket rode a line one day  
Bad little fella comin' down the way  
We were talkin' 'bout the family, its a cryin' shame  
He tell ya, "mother is workin' on the chain gang"  
She busts his britches now  
She's good at workin' hard  
  
Shoutin' bamalama  
Well, well, well  
Nobody's gonna set him down  
  
The preacher and the deacon were prayin' one day  
Along come a bear comin' down that way  
The preacher told the deacon to say a prayer  
He said, "lord, a prayer won't kill this bear"  
I gotta make it, baby  
Shout bamalama  
I gotta run for it  
Well, well, well  
Nobody's gonna set him down
