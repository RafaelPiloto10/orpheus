Call back the cap-com,  
Tick off the time-bomb  
Let felicity fly  
Armour the airlock  
Blanket the bedrock  
And kiss the planet goodbye  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far  
  
Fight back the flight deck  
Bring on the breakneck  
Cue the solar eclipse  
Summit the sunset  
Dovetail the dragnet  
And blow your backbone to bits  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far  
  
Oh telescope  
Keep an eye on my only hope  
Lest I blink and be swept off the narrow road  
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me  
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need  
  
For He is the saving grace  
Of the Galaxies  
He is the saving grace  
Of the Galaxies  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far
