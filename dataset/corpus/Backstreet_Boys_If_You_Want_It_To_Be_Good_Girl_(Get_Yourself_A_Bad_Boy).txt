If you want it to be good girl  
Get yourself a bad boy  
(Yeah I like this, ha ha)  
  
If you want it to be wild  
Gotta know just who to dial baby (that's me)  
If you really like it hot  
Find someone who hits the spot honey (oh yes)  
  
[Bridge]  
And if you want to get it done  
Babe you gotta get the one  
The one who's got it goin' on  
If you wanna make it last  
Gotta know just who to ask  
Babe he's gotta be the best (tonight it's me)  
  
[Chorus]  
If you want it to be good girl  
Get yourself a bad boy  
If you really want it good girl  
Get yourself a bad boy  
Get it like it could be, would be  
Yeah like it should be  
If you want it to be good girl  
Get yourself a bad boy  
  
If you like it innovative  
Better get someone creative honey (yes)  
And if you want it to be jammin'  
Gotta get somebody slammin' baby (oh yeah)  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
now listen  
These are things your mama shouldn't know  
These are things I really wanna show  
These are things I wanna show you how  
So won't you let me show you right now? (ooh baby)  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you really want it good [Repeat: x11]
