In the night, when a mist of sleep surrounds me  
You come to me and hold me tight, winding your body all around me  
And everywhere you touch I feel, that my love for you is much too real  
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
Sleepwalkin' - I know every move you make, and every word I say  
Keep it comin', comin' - comin' on stronger, this time I'm going all the way  
Is this moment just a fantasy, or a vision of what will be  
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
Every night the same thing, wanting you in my dreams  
(Dreams fade away)  
I better find you in my days, or I'm losin' you to the nights  
It's the same thing - every night  
It's the same thing - oh, you're so right  
It's the same thing - wanting you  
(Instrumental break)  
And tonight, evening's shadows are sure to find me  
On my nightwatch, waiting for the warmth of you beside me  
And every second that you're here I feel, this dream is real  
And it's the same damn thing, it's the same thing  
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams, dreams
