And all the order in our lives  
Left some time ago  
Along the way  
We are the ones who never cry  
Like we don't care  
Today  
  
Me at home and you out there  
And on your way  
It's gone so far and now it seems  
It's only me  
Who cares  
  
I know it helps the times you asked  
Though never gained  
A little hope to set you free  
Less restrained  
  
And though the order in our lives  
Left some time ago  
We are the ones who never cry  
Or so we're told  
  
It's gone so far and now it seems  
It's only me  
Me at home and you out there  
Along the way  
  
Me at home and you out there  
Along the way  
  
Me at home and you out there  
Along the way
