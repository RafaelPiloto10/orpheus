I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees  
Ain't no doubt about it, baby: it's you I aim to please  
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear  
It's my life, baby, but I don't care  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't that tough enough?  
Ain't that tough enough?  
Ain't that tough enough?  
Ain't that tough enough?  
  
For you, baby, I would swim the sea  
Nothin' I'd do for you that's too tough for me  
I'd put out a burning building with a shovel and dirt  
And not even worry about getting hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd work twenty-four hours, seven days a week  
Just so I could come home and kiss your cheek  
I love you in the morning, and I love you at noon  
I love you in the night and take you to the moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay in a pile of burning money that I've earned  
And not even worry about getting burned  
I'd climb the Empire State, and fight Muhammad Ali  
Just to have you, baby, close to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees  
Ain't no doubt about it, baby: it's you I aim to please  
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear  
It's my life, baby, but I don't care  
  
[Chorus]
