As days go by and fade to nights  
I still question why you left  
I wonder how it didn't work out  
But now you're gone  
And memories all I have for now  
  
But no, it's not over  
We'll get older, we'll get over  
We'll live to see the day that I hope for  
Come back to me  
  
I still believe that we'll get it right again  
We'll come back to life again  
We won't say another goodbye again  
You'll live forever with me  
  
Someday, someday  
We'll be together  
Someday, someday  
We'll be together  
  
I heard someday might be today  
Mysteries of destinies  
They are somehow and are someway  
  
For all we know they come tomorrow  
For today my eyes are open  
My arms are raised for your embrace  
My hands are here to mend what is broken  
  
To feel again the warmth of your face  
I believe there is more to life  
Oh, I love you much more than life itself  
I believe I can change your mind  
Revive what is dying inside  
  
And someday, someday  
We'll be together  
Someday, someday  
We'll be together  
  
Someday, someday  
We'll be together  
We'll be together  
We'll be together someday
