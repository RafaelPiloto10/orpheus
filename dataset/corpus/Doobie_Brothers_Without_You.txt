I get a feelin', lost without you baby  
Livin' alone is drivin' me crazy  
Don't you know  
I got nowhere to go  
You should be the one that's hurtin'  
You got everything you need  
Back in the days when love was so easy  
I was fancy free and laughin' with no reason  
Things have changed  
Your touch has grown strange  
I can't help myself  
I know that you have left me dyin' here  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you no more  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you  
I feel you know it, huh  
Oh, baby, now I'm lost without my baby  
Oh, baby, baby, babe, don't you hear right now
