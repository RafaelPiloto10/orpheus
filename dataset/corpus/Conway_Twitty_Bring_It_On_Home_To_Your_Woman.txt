Oh, I've got a few good words to lay on everybody  
It's about a man too blind to understand  
The way I've treated my woman was a doggone pity  
But we know there's a weakness in every man.  
  
Just like a fool I went and left my baby crying  
A different kind of lovin' I had on my mind  
But everybody that I met was either cheatin' or lying  
When I get a good thing at home all the time.  
  
It's a lonely old feeling when you go from town to town  
When you can't get the woman at home off your mind  
I'm so tired of livin' in this new world that I've found  
Lord I hope I didn't waste too much time.  
  
I gotta put my pride aside and call my baby  
Gotta do it now can't wait another day  
I dialed a number and then I heard the voice of my lady  
It blew my mind when I heard her say.  
  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
I've got a lot of lovin' a waitin' I hope you ain't forgot  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
And when you get there you better  
Give me all the love you've got.  
  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
I've got a lot of lovin' a waitin' I hope you ain't forgot  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
And when you get there you better  
Give me all the love you've got...
