I know you know I'm sorry  
And you know that I feel the same  
We've grown too lonesome together (Oh, yes we have)  
And all that we share is the blame.  
  
Let's take a chance while there's something to say  
Oh darling, don't throw it away  
We know that we've both got so much to lose  
And the rest of our lifetime to pay  
  
We could be good to each other (Yes, we could)  
Better than we've ever been  
Oh, darlin' we're starting all over  
It's all over, all over again  
  
I know, we could be good to each other (Yes, we could)  
Better than we've ever been  
Oh, darlin', we're starting all over  
It's all over, all over again.  
It's all over, all over again.
