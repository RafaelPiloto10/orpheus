And this is my story.  
My face, the picture's changed  
Do you remember me  
Now I'm fighting to breathe  
It's been such a long time  
  
Do you want to come  
Do you want to come  
Do you want to come with me now  
  
Nothing here for me now  
I can't believe the noise  
We'll take this place apart  
I won't be here for long  
I know they'll find me soon  
  
But now the weakness comes  
I'll question everything  
I'll trade new dreams for old  
I've been waiting for you  
I've waited far too long
