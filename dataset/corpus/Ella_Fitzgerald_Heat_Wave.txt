We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The temperature's rising,  
It isn't surprising,  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
She started a heat wave  
By letting her seat wave  
In such a way that  
The customers say that  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
Gee, her anatomy  
Makes the mercury  
Jump to ninety-three.  
  
We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The way that she moves  
That thermometer proves  
That she certainly can can-can.
