Behind closed doors all you live for is taking  
That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking  
Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter  
Don't you hear people talking? What is it that your after?  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
The key to save yourself if for nothing else  
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden  
With a broken heart underneath all of the pain  
Do you stroke the pretty scars? The hurt never ends  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect
