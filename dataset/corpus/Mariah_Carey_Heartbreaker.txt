[Repeat x8]  
Give me your love  
  
Hey  
You gotta bounce to it like this  
You almost gotta walk to this  
Uh huh  
Escape  
  
Boy your love's so good  
I don't want to let go  
And although I know I should  
I can't leave you alone  
Cause you're so disarming  
I'm caught up in the midst of you  
And I can not resist  
And oh  
  
Boy if I do  
The things you want me to  
The way I used to do  
Would you love me, baby  
Hold me, feeling now  
Go and break my heart  
  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
[Repeat x11]  
Give me your love  
  
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak  
When you smile at me  
And you tell me the things that you know  
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you  
But I can not resist at all  
  
Boy if I do  
The things you want me to  
The way I used to do  
Would you love me, baby  
Hold me, feeling now  
Go and break my heart  
  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay  
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night  
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends  
She want to creep past the block spyin' again  
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away  
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day  
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb  
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers  
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies  
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib  
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm  
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms  
She call me "Heartbreaker"  
When we apart, it makes her  
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble "I hate ya"  
But she know she love Jay because  
She love everything Jay say, Jay does  
And uh  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Give me your love
