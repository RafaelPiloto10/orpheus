The paintings of Marjorie Minkin  
Have exploded into the world  
The dynamic influctuous paintings  
Always seem to fit perfectly  
Into that empty space on your wall  
The texture of a Minkin painting  
Is so vividly intransient  
That it seems to reach out  
Into the room and grab you  
The colors have been described as  
Quote, More vibrant than any  
sunset, Unquote  
Fellow artists are often amazed  
By Minkin's work  
  
Sometimes the edge of a painting  
Will grab me  
Sometimes a corner,  
And it will attempt to wrap me up  
Often succeeding,  
And suffucate me,  
And then spit me out  
  
Who would you say is the single  
Main influence of Minkin's work?  
  
The Ubiquitous Smokey  
  
Marjorie's paintings are influenced  
By her rautical philosphy of art  
  
Some would say art is from within  
You know, a spiritual thing  
I don't buy that crap,  
Not for a single second  
I would have to say  
Art is from without  
A painting is like life  
Not your life, not my life  
In fact, not life at all  
  
Who do you consider to be  
Your main influence?  
  
That would definitely be  
Our family cat,  
The Ubiquitous Smokey  
  
Minkin's own mother  
Has been an encouraging supporting  
Source of encouragement and support  
  
Mrs. Cherry,  
How do you perceive  
Your daughter's paintings?  
  
I think they're absolutely stunning  
  
Mom, can we go out and buy a  
Marjorie Minkin painting, please?  
  
After you eat your dinner!  
  
Yes, you can buy your own painting,  
Fresh from the Minkin studio  
This month only,  
Bite-sized paintings also available
