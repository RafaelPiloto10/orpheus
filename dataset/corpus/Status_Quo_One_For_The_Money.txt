I found myself with no-one I could turn to  
The situation went from bad to worse  
While I was out there taking care of business  
Oh I was moving forward in reverse  
  
I started out with every good intention  
I wanted just to get back on my feet  
The enemy will soon be gunning  
It won't be long before I'm running  
And I'll be calling for the fleet  
  
I'm gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
I'm gonna show I was wrong  
I'm gonna win back the right  
  
Oh it wasn't for the won't of trying that I turned to the other side  
One for the money  
I never made enough for what I needed  
I thought that I could find an easy way  
But I was wrong and now I'm running  
It won't be long, and they'll be gunning for me  
  
And everybody's closing in on me  
I'm gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
I'm gonna show I was wrong  
Gonna win back the right  
Oh it wasn't for the won't of trying that I turned to the other side  
  
One for the money  
I'm gonna move to the light  
Gonna stand up and fight  
I'm gonna show I was wrong  
Gonna win back the right  
Oh it wasn't for the won't of trying that I turned to the other side  
One for the money  
One for the money, one for the money.....
