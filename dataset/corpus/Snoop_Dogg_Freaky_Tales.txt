These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
  
I met this girl her name was Joan  
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone  
When I met Joan I took her home  
She was just like a doggie all on my bone  
  
I met another girl her name was Ann  
All she wanted was to freak with a man  
When I met Ann, I shook her hand  
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can  
  
The next young freak, I met was Red  
I took her to my house and she gave me head  
She like blowin' dicks, is all she said  
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed  
  
There's another girl, her name is Sherry  
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary  
I heard she was freakin' from my big brother Jerry  
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry  
  
Young and tender, sweet Denise  
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast  
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece  
She'll only start talkin' bout signin' a lease  
  
I met a young tender, her name is Lori  
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story  
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa  
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser  
  
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle  
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale  
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well  
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell  
  
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi  
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was 'flantly'  
She had a best friend, her name was Janet  
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game  
  
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan  
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam  
The very next day, I saw her with her man  
One week passed, and I was in her again  
  
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine  
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen  
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend  
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans  
  
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy  
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me  
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta  
A country broad from Alabama  
  
I met this freak, her name was Beth  
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death  
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin' sweat  
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath  
  
Bake, and, shake, ups  
I met this freak in Vegas  
She she said her name was Don-na  
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na  
  
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo  
I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe  
You can break yourself, but you can't break me  
You never met a player like Snoop baby"  
  
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe  
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'  
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'  
She was down on her knees, beggin' to blow  
  
She's like another freak, named Renee  
You get her all alone and she'll make your day  
Like Burger King, she knows the play  
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way  
  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well!
