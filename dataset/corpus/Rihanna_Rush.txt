De gal them rush to feel the ill touch  
Gal them ball and gal them a scream  
De think it a love but a lust,  
That's why a bad gal beside is a must for I bust  
Shes the angel of me conscious yo yo yo  
  
Never thought that I could feel somethin' so strong  
I wanna hold on to this moment before it's gone  
I wanna hold your body close it's callin' to me  
And when I look into your eyes I'm likin' what I see  
Boy don't hold back on me

You know I cant fake it  
  
Yo yo yo

Most of me gal them slide off easy like a thunder clap  
When I see you from the back you know me need all a dat yo yo yo
