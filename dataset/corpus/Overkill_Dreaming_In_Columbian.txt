Worlds apart, separation from my mind.  
Just close my eyes to bring me there.  
I fall apart, the pieces are so hard to find.  
A puzzle piece is torn in half.  
  
The absence, of color, surrounds a broken dream.  
Call my eyes to take me there  
One by one I watch, as the pieces disappear,  
My friends become the ones I hate.  
This house of cards it, won't withstand the wind.  
I shut my eyes to escape.  
  
All my whites have turned to black.  
Every time I close my eyes, dream in Columbian.  
All my bugs are comin' back.  
Crawlin' on my face, they speak in!  
Columbian.  
  
Worlds apart, a separation from my soul.  
Worlds apart, the separation is now whole.  
I watch the pieces fall apart.  
I try to make a brand new start.  
I'm fallin' in, I'm fallin' out,  
I'm fallin' up, I'm fallin' back,  
I'm fallin' down, an' fallin' round, an' askin' why?
