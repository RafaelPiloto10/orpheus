Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio  
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know  
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles  
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while  
  
Clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
  
Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed  
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette  
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme  
Threw up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign  
  
And some clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
  
In my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
  
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ...  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ...
