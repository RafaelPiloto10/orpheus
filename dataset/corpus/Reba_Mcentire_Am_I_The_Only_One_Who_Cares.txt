Jamie turned 13 tonight  
But she didn't blow out the birthday lights  
Jamie and her momma had another big fight  
She locked herself in her room  
  
She climbed up on her windowsill  
Sat and stared at the cars on the street  
And listened to her own heart beat  
And whispered to the moon  
  
Am I the only one who cares what I do  
Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to  
Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you  
Or am I the only one who cares what I do  
  
The moon said Jamie can't you hear yourself  
You're acting like there ain't nobody else  
Come on girl take a big ole breath  
You know what you gotta do  
  
There's one more thing before I go  
A woman's been standing at the window below  
Searching for the words to let you know  
How much she loves you too  
  
And you're not the only one who cares what you do  
And I'm not the only one that you can turn to  
Now Jamie please believe me  
It's not just me and you  
And I'm not the only one who cares  
She cares too  
  
Jamie heard her mama  
Softly knocking at her door  
The moon just smiled and whispered  
You all don't need me anymore  
  
I'm not the only one who cares what you do  
And I'm not the only one you can tell your troubles to  
I've done the best I can  
Now the rest is up to you  
And I'm not the only one who cares  
You both care too  
You both care too
