There's a town that I call home  
Where all the streets are paved with soul  
Down on Beale there's a honky-tonk bar  
So hear the wail of a blues guitar  
Have a beer and drop a dime in the blind man's jar  
The blues sing softly in the air like a Sunday morning prayer  
Just one more drink and you'll see God everywhere  
Like a sad old melody that cheers you up, it sets you free  
That's how Memphis lives in me  
There comes a time when muddy waters run rough  
There comes a point when a man has had enough  
Like a friend that always stands by me  
Memphis knows me  
Never showed me  
How did life just had to be  
I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye  
Here I was born and here is where I'll die  
I'm just a man from Tennessee  
I can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives in me  
I said I'm just a man from Tennessee  
Can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives  
All I know is Memphis gives
