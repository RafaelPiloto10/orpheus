Let the frozen cities crumble, crumble and fall  
That's alright, I don't mind at all  
Let 'em all tumble right into the sea  
Well that's just fine, that's alright with me  
Since you came down the line  
I can't sleep at night, I got one thing on my mind  
That's every day, every night  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
'Cause you're just so out of sight  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Now I lost my job at the Texaco station  
'Cause instead of pumping gas I'd dream of you  
I got thrown out of my house, I got such a bad reputation  
'Cause all I want to do is be seen with you  
They gave me my pay and said walk  
I don't care what they say, go ahead and let 'em all talk  
  
'Til the world falls apart  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you  
That's what I want to do  
Until they will rip out my heart  
I want to be with you, I want to be with you  
Well that's all I want to do  
  
Hold tight, love me just a little bit  
Alright, a little bit more  
Tonight, tonight give me just a little kiss  
No I don't know, I don't know, I don't  
I just can't understand it, you're not pretty at all  
But I come when you whisper, I run when you call  
When I see you on the street I fall on my face  
I drop to my knees, I plead my case  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's all I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, darlin', don't you know  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you because I love you so
