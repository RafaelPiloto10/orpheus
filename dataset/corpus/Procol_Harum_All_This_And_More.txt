It's not that I'm so cheerful, though I'll always raise a smile  
And if at times my nonsense rhymes then I'll stand trial  
My friends are all around me but they only breathe through fear  
Were I to cry, I'm sure that still they'd never see a tear  
  
In darkness through my being here, away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through  
  
Dull and sullen, much subdued, my skull a stony glaze  
Whirlpools rage on constantly, I'm not so well these days  
There must be something somewhere near who sees what's being done  
The harbor lights are burning bright, my wax is almost run  
  
In darkness through my being here, away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through  
  
Come Lollard, raise your lute and sing, and to my ears her beauty bring  
Like Maddox in the days of old we'll feast and drink until we fold  
And folding still we'll spare a thought for what's been lost and what's been
caught  
And maybe then begin again for love is life, not poison  
  
In darkness through my being here, away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through
