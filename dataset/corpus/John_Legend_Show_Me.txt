Oh... oh...  
I realize as I lay down to sleep, we haven't spoke in weeks  
So many things that I'd like to know...  
Come have a talk with me  
I need a sign, something I can see  
Why all the mystery?  
I try not to fall for make-believe, but what is reality?  
  
Where do we go, what do we know?  
Life has to have a meaning  
Show me the light, show me the way  
Show that you're listening  
Show me, that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watchin over me  
  
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you for all you've given me  
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me,  
I can't stop questioning  
Oh God of love, peace, and mercy, why so much suffering?  
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me  
Wonder if you're listening...  
  
When people go, why do they go?  
Why don't you choose me?  
But someday I'll know that I'm gonna go  
I hope you're waiting for me  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show nme that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watching over me  
Oh...  
  
Show me... Oh... Oh... Show me...  
  
Maybe we'll talk some other night  
Right now I'll take it easy  
Won't spend my time waiting to die  
Enjoy the life I'm living  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watching over me  
Oh...  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watching over me  
Oh...
