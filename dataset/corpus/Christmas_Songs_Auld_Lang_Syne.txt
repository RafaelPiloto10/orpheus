Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And auld lang syne?  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,  
And surely I'll be mine!  
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
We twa hae run about the braes,  
And pu'd the gowans fine
