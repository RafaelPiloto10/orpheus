When she goes storming out  
I run for cover  
Rolling like thunder clouds  
Hanging above her  
  
Ring in the witching hour  
Spells that I'm singing  
Rain come and drown me out  
Sinking deep alone  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and  
  
We could just lay around  
Stare at the ceiling  
Want to forget about  
One for the feeling  
  
Room full of photographs  
Box full of letters  
Come on make it last  
Nothing else matters right now  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out  
  
Lets go another round  
I will bother you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out
