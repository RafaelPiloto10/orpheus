I can't get to sleep  
I think about the implications  
Of diving in too deep  
And possibly the complications  
  
Especially at night  
I worry over situations  
I know will be alright  
Perhaps it's just imagination  
  
[Chorus]  
Day after day it reappears  
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear  
Ghosts appear and fade away  
  
Alone between the sheets  
Only brings exasperation  
It's time to walk the streets  
Smell the desperation  
  
At least there's pretty lights  
And though there's little variation  
It nullifies the night  
From overkill  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't get to sleep  
I think about the implications  
Of diving in too deep  
And possibly the complications  
  
Especially at night  
I worry over situation  
I know will be alright  
It's just overkill  
  
[Chorus]
