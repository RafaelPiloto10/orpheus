My world is like a river, as dark as it is deep  
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep  
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me  
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm.  
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night  
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light  
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea  
And I'm swept away from sadness, clinging to her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm
