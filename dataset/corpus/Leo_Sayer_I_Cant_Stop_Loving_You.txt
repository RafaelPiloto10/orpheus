So you're leaving in the morning  
On the early train  
I could say everything?s alright  
I could pretend and say goodbye  
Got your ticket, got your suitcase  
Got your leaving smile  
I could say that's the way it goes  
I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  
Took a taxi to the station  
Not a word was said  
I saw you walk across the road  
Maybe the last time, I don't know  
Feeling humble, I heard a rumble  
On the railway track  
And when I hear the whistle blow  
I walk away and you don't know that I was lying  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
Though I try
