Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes  
But lately I seen her ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she aches just like a woman  
Yeah but she breaks just like a little girl  
  
Mary, she's my friend  
Yes, I believe, I'll go see her again  
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed  
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest  
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she aches just like a woman  
Yeah but she breaks just like a little girl  
  
It was rainin' from the first  
I was dyin' of thirst  
So I came in here  
  
And your longtime curse  
Hurts but what's worse  
Is this pain in here?  
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear?  
  
I just can't fit  
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit  
When we meet again, introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
I was hungry and it was your world  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
She aches just like a woman  
Yeah, takes just like a woman  
Yeah, makes love just like a woman
