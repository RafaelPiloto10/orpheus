From the Bible to the popular song  
There's one theme that we find right along  
Of all ideals they hail as good  
The most sublime is motherhood  
There was a man though, who it seems  
Once carried this ideal to extremes  
He loved his mother and she loved him  
And yet his story is rather grim  
  
There once lived a man named Oedipus Rex  
You may have heard about his odd complex  
His name appears in Freud's Index 'cause he  
Loved his mother!  
His rivals used to say quite a bit that  
As a monarch he was most unfit,  
But still and all they had to admit that he  
Loved his Mother!  
  
Yes he loved his mother like no other  
His daughter was his sister  
and his son was his brother  
One thing on which you can depend is  
He sure knew who a boy's best friend is  
When he found what he had done  
He tore his eyes out one by one  
A tragic end to a loyal son who  
Loved his mother  
  
So be sweet and kind to Mother,  
Now and then have a chat  
Buy her candy or some flowers,  
Or a brand new hat  
But, maybe you had better let it go at that  
Or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex  
And  
You may end up like Oedipus  
(I'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus)  
Then end up like old Oedipus Rex!
