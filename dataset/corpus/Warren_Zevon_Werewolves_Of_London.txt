I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand  
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain  
He was looking for a place called Lee Ho Fook's  
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein  
  
Aaoooooo!  
Werewolves of London!  
Aaoooooo! (Repeat)  
  
If you hear him howling around your kitchen door  
Better not let him in  
Little old lady got mutilated late last night  
Werewolves of London again  
  
Asoooooo!  
Werewolves of London!  
Aaoooooo! (Repeat)  
  
He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent  
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair  
Better stay away from him  
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim  
I'd like to meet his tailor  
  
Aaoooooo!  
Werewolves of London!  
Aaoooooo! (Repeat)  
  
Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen  
Doing the Werewolves of London  
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen  
Doing the Werewolves of London  
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's  
And his hair was perfect  
  
Aaoooooo!  
Werewolves of London!  
Aaoooooo! (Repeat)  
Draw blood...
