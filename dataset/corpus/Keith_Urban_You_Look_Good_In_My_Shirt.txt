When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes  
And whispered in my ear, guess who  
I rattled off names like I really didn't know  
But all along I knew it was you  
  
And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed  
And wondered why we didn't last  
It had been a long time, but later last night  
Baby, we caught up real fast  
  
[Chorus]  
And maybe it's a little too early  
To know if this is gonna work  
All I know is you're sure looking  
Good in my shirt  
  
That's right  
You look good in my shirt  
  
Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight  
Every way that we went wrong  
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing  
Every morning from now on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
c'mon now  
Aww that's right  
Oh you look so fine  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You look good in my shirt  
You look good in my shirt
