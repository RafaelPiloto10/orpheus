Have you seen the old man in the closed down market  
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes  
In his eyes you see no pride, hand held loosely at his side  
Yesterdays paper telling yesterdays news  
chorus  
So how can you tell me you're lonely  
And say for you that the sun don't shine  
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London  
I'll show you something that will make you change your mind  
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of london  
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags  
Shes no time for talking she just keeps right on walking  
Carrying her home in two carrier bags  
chorus  
In the all night cafe, at a quarter past eleven,  
Same old man sitting there on his own  
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup  
Each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone  
chorus  
Have you seen the old man, outside the seamans mission?  
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears  
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity  
For one more forgotton hero and a world that doesnt't't't care  
chorus
