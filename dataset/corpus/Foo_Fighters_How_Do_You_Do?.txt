We sat and watched a new day melt 'til dawn  
Had my share of memories, now it's time to move on  
Another lonley lesson never turned out wrong  
These things I've done without you - should have never been done  
Call on me and I'll shout down...  
  
How do you do when I'm not around?  
  
I've never felt this wrong and now I know  
This love was burnin' thru me though it never did show  
Let's spend 2 lives together kissing the stars below  
We're hot inside each other - never let you go  
Call on me and I'll shout down...  
  
Call on me and I'll shout down...
