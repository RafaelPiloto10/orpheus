Not many'd say you're handsome cause they don't realize  
That the best is often hidden from another's eyes  
But in the quiet moments that's when you stop to shine  
And every night I'm thankful that you're mine mmm that you are mine  
Cause you were born to love me in your gentle way  
Born to love me each and every day  
Born to love me born to hold me tight  
Born to love me every night every night every night  
  
I've learned it doesn't matter what other people see  
It's what I feel for you and what you feel for me  
You've made my life worth livin' because you understand  
That love is made for givin' you're so good oh yeah you're so good  
Cause you were born to love me
