It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
Baby I don't understand  
Just why we can't be lovers  
Things are gettin' out of hand  
Tryin' too much but baby we can't win  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Baby don't misunderstand  
What I'm tryin' to tell ya  
In the corner of my mind  
Baby it feels like we're running out of time  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Tearin' up my heart and soul  
We're apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or without you  
Tearin' up my heart and soul  
We're apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or with out you  
It's tearin up my heart when I'm with you  
(Tearin' up my heart and soul)  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
(We're apart I feel it too)  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you
