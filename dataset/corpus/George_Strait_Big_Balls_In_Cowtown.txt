(Big balls in cowtown, yeah)  
(Come on fiddle, yeah)  
(George)  
  
Workin' on the railroad  
Sleepin' on the ground  
Eatin' saltine crackers  
Ten cents a pound  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll all go down  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll dance around  
(Ehhhh, come in momma, the hog's done got me)  
  
(Mind if I sing one George)  
I'll go to Cowtown  
I'll dance around  
Board up your windows  
The big boy's in town  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll all go down  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll dance around  
  
Put on your new shoes  
Put on your gown  
Shake off them sad blues  
The Big Ball's in town  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll all go down  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll dance around  
(Come on Ricky, fiddle down)  
  
Everybody's smilin'  
You can't find a frown  
(Ah)  
The girls are all happy  
'Cause the Big Ball's in town  
(That's right)  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
We'll all go down  
Big Ball's in Cowtown  
Yeah, yeah Big Ball's in town
