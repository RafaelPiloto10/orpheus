You said you'd never love another  
Sweet words, empty promises  
You swore you'd always be my lover  
Look close, look into my eyes  
You will realize  
  
My heart just ain't for hire  
Times change, a new day dawned  
I ain't got time for your whim and desire  
Look close, look into my eyes  
You will realize  
  
You want my love but there's nothing on  
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong  
But you've been gone, gone, gone  
Gone too long  
  
While you were away  
Things got turned around  
I found somebody who won't bring me down  
No, never again  
No, look into my eyes you will realize  
  
You want my love but there's nothing on  
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong  
But you've been gone, gone, gone  
Gone too long, gone too long  
  
Oh, I learned to smile again  
Oh, I learned to laugh again  
Oh, baby everything's changed  
For better, I got it together  
  
You want my love but there's nothing on  
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong  
But you've been gone, gone, gone  
Gone too long  
  
You want my love but there's nothing on  
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong  
But you've been gone, gone, gone  
Gone too long
