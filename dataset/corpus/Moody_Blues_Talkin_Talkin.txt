Talking, talking.  
It doesn't really matter  
If you know my name.  
It doesn't really matter  
If you see things the same  
As I do.  
It doesn't even matter  
If I'm tired and tense.  
It doesn't even matter  
If I'm still making sense  
Over you.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking,  
'cause I'm only talking, talking,  
Talking, talking  
It doesn't matter  
What the people  
All around you say.  
Be careful how  
You listen,  
They don't know you  
The way that I do  
And, if you want to  
Talk about it baby,  
That's alright,  
It's better if I say it  
Than to sit down  
And write it to you.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking,  
'cause I'm only talking, talking.  
  
It can be that  
You're here with me  
When I'm standing out  
On my own,  
The words of love  
That you gave  
When we were alone.  
It doesn't matter  
If you want to  
Rock and roll all night,  
I know you're gonna  
Be there when the  
Feeling is right,  
The feeling is right,  
The feeling is right.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.  
You know I'm just  
Talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.
