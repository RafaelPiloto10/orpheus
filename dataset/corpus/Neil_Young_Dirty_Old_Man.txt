[Chorus]  
I'm a dirty old man  
I do what I can  
Tryin' to make a livin'  
I'm a dirty old man  
  
I like to get hammered  
On Friday night  
Sometimes I can't wait  
So Monday's alright  
  
It's a battle with the bottle  
I'll win it alright  
But I lost another round  
In the bar last night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna get fired  
For drinkin' on the job  
Got caught with the boss's wife  
In the parking lot  
  
I'm gonna get killed  
For doin' this again  
But I just can't help it  
It's under my skin  
  
I'm a dirty old man  
I do what I can  
I'm gonna get hammered  
And do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got a bag of frozen peas  
I use on my knees  
I injured from beggin'  
And tryin' to please  
  
If you believe that  
I'm losing my fat  
Got a workout program  
And a new rubber mat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a dirty old man
