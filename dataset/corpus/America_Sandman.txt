Ain't it foggy outside  
All the planes have been grounded  
Ain't the fire inside?  
Let's all go stand around it  
  
Funny I've been there  
And you've been here  
We ain't had no time to drink that beer  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I understand  
You've been running from the man  
That goes by the name of the Sandman  
He flies the sky  
Like an eagle in the eye of a hurricane that's abandoned  
  
Ain't the years gone by fast  
I supposed you have missed them  
Oh, I almost forgot to ask  
Did you hear of my enlistment?  
  
[Chorus]
