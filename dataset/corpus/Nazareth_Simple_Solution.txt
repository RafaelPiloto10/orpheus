Old man, don't tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
Look you now, where the locusts abound  
Pray they don't feed on your sacred ground  
  
Vibrations, are burning my hands  
Slowly walking, stalking through these crazy lands  
Defending the need, with a silent scream  
For another time, for another dream  
  
Jack boots, hi-jacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin' at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
No cheap-o, clean-o, is gonna wash away my blues  
I need a good friend that's gonna give me some clues  
The one on the cross, he almost had it boss  
He was really spreading the news  
Ah, but the destruct mutt, he's back in business  
He ain't about to lose  
  
Jackboots, hi-jacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin' at me  
It could be there lookin' at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
And the price-for life  
Is one more run on that chicken wire  
As the hero returns  
With eyes of fire  
To another man to man, so damn you man!  
  
Old man don't tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
So look you now, where the locusts abound  
Prat they don't feed on your sacred ground.
