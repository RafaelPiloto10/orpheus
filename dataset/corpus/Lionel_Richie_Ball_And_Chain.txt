Here I am standing in the mirror, looking in my eyes  
Trying not to fool myself, and realize  
Times are getting harder for us to get along  
Everything about this love is all going wrong  
You keep on telling me to do this, do that,  
And I need to change my ways  
But I think that maybe the price of this love,  
Is too high to pay  
  
Ball and chain, Is the feeling that I am feeling tonight  
When love's a, Ball and chain,  
It don't matter who's wrong or right  
  
I keep on living in confusion, wondering where I am at  
Trying to figure out if I should do this thing or that  
I can't see the future, and I can't change the past  
But I'm feeling that this love of ours just ain't gonna last  
I've been down one time, two times, three times, fou  
I've been waiting for times to get better,  
And I can't take it no more  
  
Ball and chain, that's the feeling that I am feeling tonight  
This love's a, Ball and chain,  
It don't matter who's wrong or right  
  
Time, I would love for time to be on our side  
But I know that this love affair, Is all over now  
  
Ball and chain, it's a feeling that I am feeling tonight  
This love's a, Ball and chain  
It don't matter who's wrong or right,  
This love's a, Ball and chain,  
It's a feeling that I am feeling inside  
When love's a, Ball and chain,  
It don't matter who's wrong or right
