No one knows where she comes from  
Maybe she's a devil in disguise  
I can tell by looking in her eyes  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange  
  
Little miss Strange came into my parlor  
I don't know just what to ask her  
I don't remember what we did after  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange  
  
Little miss Strange came out of the darkness  
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light  
I'm talkin' 'bout the dream I had the other night  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange
