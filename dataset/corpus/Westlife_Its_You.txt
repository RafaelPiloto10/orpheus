There's a laugh in my eyes  
There's a waltz in my walk  
And it's been such a long time  
Since there was hope in my talk  
If you never knew  
What it is that's new... It's you  
  
Cause when your hands are in mine  
You set a fire that everyone can see  
And it's burning away  
Every bad memory  
To tell you the truth  
If it's something new... Baby it's you  
  
It's you in the morning  
It's you in the night  
A beautiful angel came down  
To light up my life  
  
The world's a different place  
Where nothings too hard to say  
And nothings to hard to do  
Never too much to go through  
To tell you the truth  
Everything that's new... Baby it's you  
  
It's you in the morning  
It's you in the night  
A beautiful angel came down  
To light up my life  
My life, my life  
Oh  
  
So if I get to grow old (oh if I get to grow old)  
With many years behind me (many years behind me)  
There's only one thing I want (ahh)  
One thing I need beside me  
For all that you are  
For everything you do  
For all that you've done  
Just for showing me the truth  
  
It's you  
It's you  
Baby it's you
