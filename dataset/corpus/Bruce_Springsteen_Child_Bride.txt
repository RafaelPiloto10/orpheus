A lovely, poignant song  
About a man fated to be kept apart from his true love  
  
"well, sometimes I dream of gettin' outta here,  
Headin' down towards them old tracks  
I swore I'd come and get her  
But I know I ain't never goin' back  
  
"there's nights I can't sleep  
No matter how hard I try  
So from my window I watch the moonlight  
Fall on the far hillside  
  
"I imagine I put on my jacket,  
Go down to this little roadside bar  
Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor  
To a mexican guitar"
