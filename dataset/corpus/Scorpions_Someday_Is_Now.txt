Blood rains down across the tundra  
Ice flows through my veins  
As my life drains  
Northern bound, my dogs are dying  
But I still know  
That nothing is impossible  
  
I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the world around me receding  
No time for bleeding  
Show the world how  
Someday is now  
  
Eight steps till I reach the summit  
My line breaks and I fall down  
The rocky terrain  
My bones are broken into pieces  
My mind can't wait  
To get up and do it again  
  
I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying  
There's no time for crying  
I'm gonna win someday  
  
No turning back, no more yesterdays  
I just won't get lost in the haze  
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow  
Watch out for the rest of my days  
  
Stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying  
There's no room for crying  
I'm gonna win some way  
Someday is now
