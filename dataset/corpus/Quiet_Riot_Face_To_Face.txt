Now I've got a chick who will be with me  
Anytime, day or night  
But I won't put up with no runnin' around  
You know it just ain't right  
I'm going down...  
To the town -  
Out to go drink with the clowns  
You stay at home...  
All alone -  
And don't you talk on the phone  
  
You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not  
  
When I got to town  
The words going 'round  
That you've been seen on your back  
I open the door and you were on the floor  
Spreadin' for the clowns in my pack  
Now you were wrong...  
If you thought -  
I'd take it lyin' down like a dog  
I put a match...  
In her snatch  
She thinks she's such a hot little vamp  
  
You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You comn' face to face with me, like it or not  
  
Tear your face apart  
Waste you in the dark  
Rip you like a shark  
Won't think you're so smart  
  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face  
Face to face  
  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Your're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not
