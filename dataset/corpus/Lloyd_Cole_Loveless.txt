You lie in the heat of a summer haze  
And turn it into a winter's tale  
You pull down the blinds and shut out the sky  
And do what you can to turn the whole thing grey  
You're crying and pleading and you're hell just to be with  
And you're everything that I'll ever need  
So why do you say you love me when you don't?  
You fall back into the english way  
Of feeling only guilt 'cause you feel no pain  
You sit and you stare at the empty page  
And then you fill it with verse, make the whole thing worse  
You lie and you cheat your own mind to believing  
That you don't need anything or anyone  
So why do you say you love me when you don't?  
And why should I feel blue when I do?  
Why?  
You lie in the heat of a summer haze  
And turn it into a winter's tale  
You fall back into the english way  
Of feeling only guilt 'cause you feel no pain  
You're crying and pleading and you're hell just to be with  
And you're everything that I'll ever need  
So why do you say you love me when you don't?  
Why should I feel...  
And who's gonna love the loveless if not you?  
Why?  
Why?
