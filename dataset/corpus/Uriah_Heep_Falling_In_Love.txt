Falling keep on falling  
Keep on falling love  
  
Now I don't mind  
All this running around  
Seems I've been doing it  
Most of my life  
My music's been kind  
But some days I find  
It brings me two kinds of trouble  
And three kinds of strife  
  
So don't try to compare it  
'cause I just want to  
Share it with some people  
I like to call friends  
There ain't nothing bad and  
No need to feel sad  
And there's certainly no need  
To make amends  
  
It won't do you no harm and  
There's no cause for alarm  
I won't be praying for  
Help from above  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling in love  
  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling  
Keep on falling  
Keep on falling in love
