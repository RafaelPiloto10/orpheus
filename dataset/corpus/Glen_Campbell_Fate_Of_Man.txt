Pity a man for he don't know  
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road  
  
When a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all  
He can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall  
But fall he will as he travels through life  
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife  
  
Now at 50 he's goin' real strong  
He has him a family and a nice little home  
But old age is creeping up his spine  
And the day is comin' when the sun won't shine  
  
Now at 60 he won't have to guess  
He's already missed the boat that leads to success  
But he's done his best and he can't see why  
The fame of life just passed him by  
  
Now at 70 he can see the light  
And he knows he's never been very bright  
But he's done his best as he's travelled by  
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh  
  
Pity a man for he don't know  
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road  
  
Now at 80 he's ready for the wreath  
He's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth  
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet  
And nothin' seems good to eat  
  
So you can pity him as he goes up the line  
As he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind  
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone  
That it won't be long before he's goin' home  
  
But if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life  
He'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife  
He's worked all his life to get things the way he wants 'em  
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed
