Can't I  
Will I ever love you again  
Tell me, why then can't I  
Maybe others  
Want you just like I do  
Tell me, why then can't I  
You might have known others  
  
So have I  
Who would hurt you  
And dessert you  
That's why I o-only want to  
  
Hold you, always  
Never to let you go  
Tell me, why then can't I  
You might have known others  
  
So have I  
Who would hurt you  
And dessert you  
That's why I o-only want to  
  
Hold you, always  
Never to let you go  
Tell me, why then can't I  
Tell me, why then can't I
