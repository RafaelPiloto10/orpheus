I was courting a southern belle  
Her Daddy was a rich 'un, too  
Sports car outside her door  
She was pretty good lookin', too  
  
You call me up, want me to come over  
When the servants are all in bed  
And she said, "Daddy's on a flight tonight  
Does that put any ideas in your head?"  
  
I say to her:  
  
Take it all the way  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Down down  
Down down down  
  
So we watch a little TV  
I drink up the family wine  
She said, "You're such a snake in the grass, boy  
But tonight you're mine"  
  
But wait a minute, wait a minute baby  
Are you tryin' to make a fool out of me  
She said, "I've seen men like you, before  
I've got a long family tree"  
  
And she said to me:  
  
Take it all the way  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Down down  
Down down down  
  
And I say to myself, "Even a fool like me can be the loving kind"  
Even a fool like me can be the loving kind  
  
Take it all the way  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Can you really take it all the way down  
Down down  
Down down down
