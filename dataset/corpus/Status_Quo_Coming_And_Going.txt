Let me know what I want to know  
If you really want me don't you let me go  
  
And let me see what I want to see  
Move in my direction, move in close to me  
  
I see you here, I see you there  
And when I close my eyes I feel you everywhere  
  
So let me give what I want to give  
Got my own way of showing how I want to live  
  
Coming and going and highing and lowing  
Baby I'm trying to tell you I love you
