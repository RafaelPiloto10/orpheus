When Rome's in ruins,  
We are the lions free of the coliseums  
In poison places, we are empty venom  
We're the beginning of the end  
  
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds  
It's all over now  
Before it has begun  
We've already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?  
  
Come on, make it easy, say I never mattered  
Run it up the flag pole,  
We will teach you how to make boys next door out of assholes  
  
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds  
And it's all over now  
Before it has begun  
We've already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?
