I don't want to spend my life trying to change you  
This time I'm gonna take it as it comes  
There are so many things that I want to ask you  
I am unafraid of what the answers may be  
  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
Before you walk away  
And start burning any bridges  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
This woman's not the one you knew  
There's been so many changes  
  
Please don't turn my love away  
(Don't turn my love away)  
I'm gonna love you like no one's ever done before  
Oh please don't turn your love away  
(Turn my love away)  
I'm gonna show you a love like you've never known  
  
We travel so many roads in a lifetime  
In search of a promise, (Promise of a dream come true)  
And now that I've found you  
Like a falling star falling from the midnight sky  
I've got to let you know  
  
(If only I knew then)  
If I knew then what I know now  
Babe I got no doubt that you'd be mine  
(Baby got no doubt that you'd be mine)  
No doubt in my mind you'd be mine  
  
Please don't turn my love away  
(Don't turn my love away)  
I'm gonna love you like no one's ever done before  
Oh please don't turn away my love away  
(Turn my love away)  
I'm gonna show you a love like you've never known  
  
Don't you turn away, run away and leave me this way  
Don't you turn away, don't you run away
