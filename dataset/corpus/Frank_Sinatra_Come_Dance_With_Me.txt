Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots  
And come dance with me  
Come dance with me, what an evenin' for some Terpsichore  
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place  
Come on, dance with me  
Romance with me on a crowded floor  
And while the rhythm swings  
What lovely things I'll be sayin'  
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love  
Set to music...playin'  
When the band begins to leave the stand  
And folks start to roam  
As we waltz home, cheek to cheek we'll be  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on and dance with me  
  
Hey there cutes, put on your Basie boots  
And come dance with me  
Come dance with me, what an evenin' for some Terpsichore  
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place  
Come on, dance with me  
Romance with me on a crowded floor  
And while the rhythm swings  
What cuckoo things I'll be sayin'  
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love  
Set to music...playin'  
When the band begins to leave the stand  
And folks start to roam  
As we wing home, cheek to cheek we'll be  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on and dance with me
