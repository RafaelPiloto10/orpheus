Kickin' down the road  
Feelin' mighty slowed  
With the likes of you  
Gettin' mighty spaced  
Never had a taste  
Of what you're goin' through  
I can't bitch  
Went from rags to riches  
Then to ragtime screamin' the blues  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Try to make a fool out of me  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Gotta make a fool  
Gotta make a fool  
Try to make a fool out of me  
Swing low  
Sweet cherry o  
When a strange love showed me the way  
Ya see more  
Can't keep a score  
When the whore's comin' on for the play  
E. Poe  
Eatin' crow  
Wonder if he knowed that the raven was mad  
Time passed  
And words lost the last  
Of the best thing he ever had  
Oh play rough  
Can't get enough  
So they try to make a fool out of me, lordy  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me
