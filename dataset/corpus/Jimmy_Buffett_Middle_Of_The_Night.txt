[Chorus]  
Middle of the night  
Hold on 'till morning  
We will see the light  
Love is spawning  
Middle of the night  
Hold on forever  
We'll know when it's right  
All together  
  
When will we listen  
When will we ever learn  
Read all about it  
This tide has got to turn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Old folks and babies  
They're crying in the storm  
I tried to tell them  
Soon they'll be safe and warm  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord let us out of this hall full of mirrors  
Make it all clearer  
Don't let us fall  
In the middle of the night  
  
Middle of the night  
New voices calling  
Saying it's alright  
I'm not falling  
Middle of the night  
Halfway 'till morning  
Middle of my life  
New days dawning  
  
Middle of the night  
Hold on 'till morning  
We will see the light  
Love is spawning  
Middle of the night  
Hold on forever  
We'll know when it's right  
All together  
  
Middle of the night  
New voices calling  
Saying it's alright  
I'm not falling  
Middle of the night  
Halfway 'till morning  
Middle of my life  
New days dawning  
  
[Chorus]
