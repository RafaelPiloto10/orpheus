Weren't you the pilot  
Who fell from the skies?  
Was it a big mistake  
Or just plain homicide?  
How does it feel on the other side?  
Do you hang out with the  
Saints or the spies?  
  
Are you still hellraising?  
Are you still hellraising?  
Hellraising  
  
Is this the kind of thing we always fear?  
Are you so bent on hell you'd leave  
Me up here? (without you)  
God bless the miles we traveled too fast  
God help the suckers  
Dead in your path  
  
Are you still hellraising?  
Are you still hellraising?  
Hellraising  
  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay  
  
This love was born on crutches, crippled and bored  
Ripped out asleep and strangled by a phone cord  
Weren't you the pilot who swerved off the course  
Was it disaster or just plain divorce?  
  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Are you still hellraising?  
Hellraising  
  
Hell  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
  
Hell  
Hell  
Hell (raising)  
Hellraising  
Hellraising
