I had it tough when I was just a little kid  
It didn't matter what I thought  
It didn't matter what I did  
  
I felt the doubt for what I lacked  
Right from the start  
It did a number on my head  
But it could never touch my heart  
  
'Cause I had just enough imagination  
Just enough to keep the faith  
That somehow I would think of what to do  
When I get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion  
Honey angels came around to help me through  
  
Life pulls fast changes  
Winds blows past pages  
All I see is I don't need this  
High-strung tight rope walk  
Ticking time bomb clock  
Scratch my name  
Cut these chains  
  
I'm free  
Kicking out of that prison  
I am free  
Singing those words of wisdom  
Let it be  
Nobody gonna put the blues inside of me  
  
I've been stressed to be the best,  
I've done it all  
I've slammed the doors, I've jammed the locks  
I've paved the bricks, I've built the wall  
No one could tell me back then  
What joy eluded me  
Kept bumping into that misery  
Locked up deep down inside of me  
  
Took that rage and I  
Turned that page and I  
Packed my tools, went back to school  
Yeah, and I passed my graduation  
And I hold my PhD in  
Crash test blues,  
I've paid those dues  
  
I'm free  
Kicking out of that prison  
I am free  
Singing those words of wisdom  
Let it be  
Nobody gonna put those blues inside of me  
  
Time flies by in photographs  
And paper scraps and songs  
Here I stand in ruby slippers  
Three taps take me home  
  
I'm free  
I'm free  
I'm free  
Kicking out of that prison  
  
I am free  
Singing those words of wisdom  
Let it be (let it be!)  
Nobody gonna put the blues inside of me  
Oh yeah, I am free  
  
I am free  
I am free  
I am free  
I am free  
I am free  
I am free  
  
Time flies by in photographs  
And paper scraps and songs  
Here I stand in ruby slippers  
Three taps take me home  
  
I'm free  
I'm free  
I'm free  
  
Yeah, I'm free  
Free.
