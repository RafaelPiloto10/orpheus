Only one gift on my list  
I don't have to check it twice  
I'm gonna have to count of St. Nick  
Maybe he can make it right  
  
I know but I'll try anything  
And miracles have happened  
And I think I hear those sleigh bells ring  
Oh oh  
  
I gotta get the Christmas spirit  
I can't get anywhere near it  
But I'm here hoping desperately  
I'll do it up with all the trimmings  
Christmas tree and carols singing  
Anything to bring my baby back to me  
  
All I want's a happy ending  
Waiting there when I get home  
I don't want to wind up spending  
Another winter all alone  
  
I hope it's not too much to ask  
I'm sure you must be busy  
So I'll try to end this story fast  
Oh oh  
  
I gotta get the Christmas spirit  
I can't get anywhere near it  
But I'm here hoping desperately  
I'll do it up with all the trimmings  
Christmas tree and carols singing  
Anything to bring my baby back to me  
  
I gotta get the Christmas spirit  
I can't get anywhere near it  
But I'm here hoping desperately  
I'll do it up with all the trimmings  
Christmas tree and carols singing  
Anything to bring my baby back to me  
  
Santa bring my baby back  
Santa bring my baby back  
Santa bring my baby back to me  
Santa bring my baby back  
Santa bring my baby back  
Santa bring my baby back to me
