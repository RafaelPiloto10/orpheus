I'll be with them asleep and dreaming  
I'll be there when they wake with screaming  
At the hour of death then I will nurse them  
To have a moment more to curse them  
Watch the maggots crawl out of them  
Hear the angels call above them  
Watch them as the cold air sucks them  
Down to hell, goodnight, God love them  
If any should escape above me  
Beg and cheat until they trust me  
Drag them down to be damned with me  
Laugh at them as they forgive me  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds,  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight  
Yigh!  
  
I wish that they could walk forever,  
On the earth, alone, unfettered  
Til they pray for consolation,  
Til they beg for sweet damnation  
Then I'll come and bring them water,  
Bring them hope, bring them laughter  
Raise their hopes so sad and sunken  
Slash them up as they lie there drunken  
Push them down into the foul mud  
'Til they choke up on their own blood  
Drag them out before their last breath  
To take away the mercy of death  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight  
Yigh!  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the Gates of Hell tonight  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight
