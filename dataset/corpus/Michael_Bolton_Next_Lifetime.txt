Don't know why I never told you  
There was something in your eyes that took my breath away  
And every word I meant to say  
Now I know I'd give my soul to you  
Take you back in time and hold you  
Just for one more day, so I wouldn't have to hurt this way  
So I beg and plead, I'm on my knees  
Gonna show you how long I can wait  
I can't keep holding on if you're telling my heart it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
Next lifetime our love will be deeper  
And I'll hold you sweeter  
I won't waste so much time  
Next lifetime I'll find you sooner  
And I'll kiss you better  
I won't lose you next time  
Oh I will lay my heart on the line, next lifetime  
  
I don't know what I was thinking  
But giving you a part of me wasn't good enough  
Never gave you all my love  
I can't believe I was such a fool  
All I needed was to prove to you I could feel like this  
Could have said it all in our last kiss  
Oh I beg and plead, I'm on my knees  
I could never unmake my mistake  
I can keep holding on but if somebody's taking my place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never knew how long the nights could be  
Till you slipped right through my hands  
How do I make you believe that I deserve a second chance  
Take me back to the place where your heart was mine  
If I could take you back in time  
I will lay my heart on the line [Repeat x2]
