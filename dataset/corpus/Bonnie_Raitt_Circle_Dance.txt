I don't' know why it should be so hard  
Givin' up this circle dance  
Worn out steps from long ago  
Don't give love a chance  
It's a bitter heirloom handed down  
These twisted parts we play  
  
I'm not her and you're not him  
It just comes out that way  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
We did the best we could  
  
I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say  
And a little kid believes  
After a while I learned that love  
Must be a thing that leaves  
I tried so hard just to hold you near  
Was as good as I could be  
  
Even when I had you here  
You stayed so far from me  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
  
You did the best you could  
Now that this has occurred to me  
I just wanted you to know  
I've been too faithful all my life  
It's time to let you go
