Time: 2:15, the AM.  
Place: Ronardo's "Boom-Boom-Room" on South Street  
I'm a hot blonde and it was a cold night  
This is my story. I ain't ashamed to tell it  
I was hungry, tired and lookin' for love  
  
I was just a pilgrim in the hot pursuit of love  
Wandered from disco to disco  
That's all my life was  
Suddenly you danced up against me  
It felt warm and smooth  
I knew in an instant  
That you were my moment of darkest truth  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part  
  
Only you can shine the light  
On the dark side of my mind  
And your evil sweetness  
Leaves a trail of lovers behind  
When you crush me to your heart  
I feel just like a queen  
I'm a willing victim  
Tell me, all my life where have you been?  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part, haaa  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Take me down and love me forever  
Walk on through the halls of my soul  
Knight in black leather  
And you've got control  
Oh, don't ya know, baby?  
  
You're my knight!  
See'mon and love me forever!  
Rings on your fingers, love on demand  
Knight in black leather  
Oh, you've got command  
And how I love ya, baby  
  
Whoa, my knight!  
Sweet, sweet knight!  
You know that I love you, I love you, love you!  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aart!  
  
(We're the knights in black leather  
And we will chain you down  
And love you forever  
Walk on through the halls of your soul  
Yeah, the knights in black leather  
We're in controoool!)  
  
You know he smells just like a brand new car  
'Cause everything he owns is leather!  
A leather shirt, leather hat  
Leather gloves, leather spats  
Leather chaps, leather pants  
Leather socks, leather cap  
Leather coat! leather wrap!  
Leather neck! leather ring!  
Leather thing!!!!  
  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aart!  
Oh, my knight in black leather!  
Take us down! Love me honey, come on, love me!  
You got to hold me, hold me!  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aart!  
Whoa-oh-ooo-oh-oh!...
