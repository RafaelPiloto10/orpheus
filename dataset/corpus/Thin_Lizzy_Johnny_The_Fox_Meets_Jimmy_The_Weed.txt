Johnny the Fox he called to Jimmy the Weed  
He said "Hey man, I know your name"  
I seen you cruising with the low riders  
Hanging out down on First street and Main  
  
Tuned into and listen to the voodoo Rhythm Devils  
Around the Bay  
They've got some crazy DJs  
Send you right out to heaven  
  
Jimmy the Weed for greed was taken aback  
Johnny the Fox you old sly cat  
Cleverly the Fox concealed his stash  
Crisp dollar bills leave no tracks  
  
In the back of a black cadillac  
The voodoo music travels  
Down Skid Row only black men can go  
The shady deal unravels  
  
Johnny the Fox, hot to hustle  
Jimmy the Weed won't use no muscle  
that cat's so sly, slick and subtle  
Johnny the Fox breaks out the bottle  
  
Tuned into and listening to  
The voodoo music travels  
The beating drum for the lonely one  
Sends you out to heaven
