Chorus: Slow down, little Jaguar  
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford  
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road  
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford  
Jaguar setting on ninety nine  
Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line  
Just a half-a-mile from Newtonville  
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill  
It said : "35 miles, and stay in line"  
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign  
Chorus  
Ludenville was a real small town  
Had a hundred and two  
And nine acres of ground  
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise  
Told him "Park down in Newtonville  
And catch 'em guys"  
Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds  
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed  
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road  
Said "Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford"  
Chorus  
Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third  
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird  
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine  
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line  
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat  
But if he aimed to get 'em  
He'd have to do more than that  
Crest of the hill, he's about a mile behind  
There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line  
Chorus  
Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade  
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made  
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed  
And waved "Goodbye, Jaguar" and pulled in the lead  
Jaguar said "You ain't won the race yet"  
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet  
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind  
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line  
Slow down little Jaguar,  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford  
(repeat and fade)
