You were my first love  
The earth moving under me  
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent  
Distant shiver, heaven sent  
  
I'm the snow on your lips  
The freezing taste, the silvery sip  
I'm the breath on your hair  
The endless nightmare, devil's lair  
  
Only so many times  
I can say I long for you  
The lily among the thorns  
The prey among the wolves  
  
Someday, I will feed a snake  
Drink her venom, stay awake  
With time all pain will fade  
Through your memory I will wade  
  
Barely cold in her grave  
Barely warm in my bed  
Settling for a draw tonight  
Puppet girl, your strings are mine  
  
This one is for you for you  
Only for you  
Just give in to it never think again  
I feel for you
