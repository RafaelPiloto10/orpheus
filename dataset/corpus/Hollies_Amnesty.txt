Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea  
I'll give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
  
Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Given by the powers  
Then let us be  
I'll give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
'Cause I need you  
  
[Chorus:]  
We can talk  
We can see  
If we disagree we do it honestly  
Let our lovin' be  
The sweetest amnesty  
  
Between you and me  
There's bound to be  
Some conscientious objection  
Our spirits dressed in mystery  
Speak solely through affection  
  
Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea  
I'll give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
  
"Cause I need you (need you)  
  
[Chorus]  
Let our lovin' be  
The sweetest amnesty
