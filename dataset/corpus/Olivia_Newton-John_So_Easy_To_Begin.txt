Well I've been so far away from you  
Though standin' by your side  
And there were nights we were so in love  
That lovin' made me blind  
But that time is so far below us now  
The memory so thin  
It's so easy to begin  
But it's so hard to stop this love  
It's just so hard to stop  
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in  
It's so easy to begin  
And I've at least saved some lessons from  
A time I fell apart  
And I know you've been wondering why  
I look at you so hard  
But I never want to wake up someday  
And wonder where we've been  
It's so easy to begin  
But it's so hard to stop this love  
It's just so hard to stop  
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in  
It's so easy to begin
