Look, the homeless on the street  
The little shoeblack on his knees  
A good heart and the daily fighter  
Policemen, gangster and the priest  
Wheelchair woman on her feet  
Chinese smoker with his dragon lighter  
  
They're all fighting through their lives  
Against their enemies  
Reaching out for the light  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes, heroes  
  
Look this old man's only teeth  
When he smiles underneath  
Searching for some food on the ground  
The musician at the store  
Selling his guitar for naught  
It's rent that matters not the sound  
  
They're all fighting through their lives  
Against their enemies  
Reaching out for the light  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes, heroes
