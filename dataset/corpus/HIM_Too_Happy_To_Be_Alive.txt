We're still breathin'  
This can't be love.  
Baby we're tryin'  
Shed a few tears more.  
And we keep on waiting,  
Just to get caught.  
And we know this is exactly what we want.  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
(x2)  
  
Now we feel it comin',  
Peircing our hearts.  
Fingers crossed and we're praying,  
Nothing goes wrong.  
And it's finally happenin',  
Just a knock on our door.  
Our hearts are beatin',  
Oh it's just begun.  
  
Chorus(x2)  
  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
Oh we fear for the best  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
Too happy, too happy, we're too happy to be alive.  
Too happy. too happy. we're too happy to be alive.  
Too happy. too happy. CAUSE we're too happy to be alive. oh my love  
So...
