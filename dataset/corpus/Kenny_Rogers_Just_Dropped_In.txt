I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in  
I found my mind in a brown paper bag but then  
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high  
I tore my mind on a jagged sky  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in  
  
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in  
I watched myself crawling out as I was a-crawling in  
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind  
I saw so much I broke my mind  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in  
  
Someone painted April Fool in big black letters on a Dead End sign  
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind  
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare  
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
Yeah  
yeah  
oh-yeah
