Intro: (some 'dreadhead', won't translate to avoid offending)  
  
Verse 1:  
  
One, two, three and I come with the wicked  
Style and you know that I'm from the wicked  
Crew, act like you knew  
Cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo  
Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs  
While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]  
Play ya and I'll slay ya  
I got thug-made dough by the hey-a  
Ready to buck buck buck and it's a must  
To duck duck duck before I bust  
Lookin for the one that did it  
But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it  
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills  
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills  
Sittin at the pad just chillin  
Cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin  
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill  
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal  
Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that test tube baby  
Kick it cos I get wicked  
  
Chorus: (some toaster, once again won't translate to avoid offending)  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Don't say nuttin, just listen  
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison  
Come my way and get served  
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb  
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin  
Never seen with a happy grin  
Show the fat foul cos I'm down  
Take a look around  
And all you see is big black boots steppin  
Use my steel toe as a weapon  
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to  
Label this nigga, tape with the sticker  
Kickin out girls that's nicety  
Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T  
From here to New York  
I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork  
Swine, pig, dick  
Listen to the flow of a so-called negro  
Who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett  
Dig it cos I get wicked  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3:  
  
People wanna know how come  
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm  
Ready to bring that noise  
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys  
April 29th was power to the people  
And we might just see a sequel  
Cos police got equal pay  
A haza is a pig that don't fly straight  
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams  
Down with the pilgrims  
Just a super slave  
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave  
I'm wicked enough to board this  
Cos now it's on to the fullest  
Gorilla straight from the mist  
But I don't miss when it comes to this  
Bring the yellow tape  
The white cape, cos I'm so straight  
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it  
Bigot, cos I get wicked
