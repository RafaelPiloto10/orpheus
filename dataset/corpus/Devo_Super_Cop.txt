Super cop  
  
I was born to serve justice  
But I don't sermonize  
Good is good  
Bad is bad  
And I never compromise  
  
They lock me in a rocket  
Made of flesh and bone  
I'll meet you in the war zone  
With my fists of stone  
  
I'm a super cop  
I'm a super cop  
  
My body's a machine  
Made to synchronize  
Every time I'm called to action  
Make me recognize  
When the forces of corruption  
Do the tyrannize  
Then I shift to overdrive  
And start to pulverize  
  
I'm a super cop  
  
Eliminate the foe  
With karate chops  
I'm a super cop  
I'm a super charged cop  
And I can't be stopped.  
  
I'm a super cop  
  
I was born to serve justice  
Get my name  
I'm a super cop  
  
Kung fu action is my game  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
He drives around in a world turned upside down  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
He's gotta round up all the evil clowns  
I'm a cop now  
  
A super cop now  
  
What he sees just makes him want to cry  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
He works alone 'cause if he don't he'll die  
  
(spoken) the truth and protect  
The motto I ascribe to  
With equal justice  
For the down and out or well to do  
I'm a super cop  
A gangster's worst nightmare  
One man demolition team  
I'll send them into disrepair  
  
He's been fighting,  
Fighting for so long  
  
I'm a super cop  
  
He's been righting,  
Righting every wrong  
  
I'm a super cop  
  
Now he's hiding  
From the long arm of the law  
  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
He gets up and tries to save the world  
  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
He goes out and tries to find a girl  
  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
If you're a punk he'll aim straight for your belt  
  
I'm a cop now  
A super cop now  
He makes the news every time he kicks some butt  
  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop
