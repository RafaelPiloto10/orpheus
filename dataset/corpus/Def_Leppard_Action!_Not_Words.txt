I'm sick and tired of the damn TV  
I'm gonna make my own movie  
I want to star in a late night show  
And all I need is my video  
  
Shock me! Make it electric!  
Shock me! Make it last  
  
Curtain up let the camera roll  
It's automatic it's in control  
Got no script baby, ain't no lines  
Just me and you and a real good time  
  
Oh shock me! Make it electric  
Shock me! Make it last  
Shock me! Gimme thunder 'n' lightning  
Shock me! Ooh babe I need it fast  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause all I want is some  
Action, action, action, not words  
Gimme action, action, action not words  
  
C'mon and shock me, let the cameras roll!  
  
Oh! I'll be the hero, you be the star  
With your wine and your caviar  
No audition, a starring roll  
I'll be your Bogart 'n' you be Monroe yeah  
  
Shock me! Make it electric  
Shock me! Oh bump and grind  
Shock me! Make a night to remember  
Shock me! Do it one more time  
  
So cut me in on the action  
  
Lights, camera, sound, I need action!  
  
[Chorus]
