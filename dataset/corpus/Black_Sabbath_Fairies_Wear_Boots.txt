Goin' home, late last night  
Suddenly I got a fright  
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw  
A fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf,  
All right now!  
  
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes,  
Oh all right now!  
  
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes,  
All right now!  
  
So I went to the doctor  
See what he could give me  
He said Son, son, you've gone too far.  
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do.
