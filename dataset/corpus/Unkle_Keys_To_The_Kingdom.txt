I shoot it low, kill the flow  
Ruin myself out on the north shore  
I make it one, watch the sun  
Sink behind the trees with the keys to the kingdom  
  
I shoot it high, let it fly  
Bury myself under a blue sky  
I see a scheme, make it clean  
Drown in blue rivers under a muffled scream  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
I hit it down, kill the sound  
Ruin myself out on the northbound  
I make it one, kill the sun  
Bury my disease with the keys to the kingdom  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
I shoot it low  
Shoot it low  
Kill the flow  
Kill the flow  
Ruin myself out on the north shore  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again
