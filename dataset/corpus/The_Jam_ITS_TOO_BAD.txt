All we seem to do is talk about it  
We always end up shouting about it  
There was a time we could overcome it  
But it's too late to say we'll just forget it  
It's too bad that we had to break up  
And too much said for us to every make up  
I could get by if I could just forget you  
But things remind me and I feel so sad now  
  
I could say I'm sorry  
But it's not the point is it?  
You want to play your games and  
You don't mind if I get hurt  
  
Same old feeling every time I see you  
And every avenue I walk I'm behind you  
Your back is turned and your eyes are closed girl  
You move in circles that are out of my reach now
