Take me to the river baby drink my wine  
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line  
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs  
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers  
  
When will you show me a sign  
When will you throw me a line  
  
Help me to the answer baby set me free  
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea  
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face  
Keep me out of trouble and I'm living disgrace  
  
Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name  
Standing in a line with the shadows of fame  
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs  
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers
