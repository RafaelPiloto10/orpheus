I hope it's too late,  
And you're already to far, gone  
'cause my heart aches,  
Whenever I'm away too long  
  
'cause if I miss you, even by a minute,  
I'll lose my whole world, everything in it,  
I never wanna say goodbye  
  
Baby 'cause I hope it's too late,  
To change your mind,  
'cause I'm never changing mine  
And I, I just gotta say, it's gotta be you,  
Until the end of time  
And I, hope it's too late  
  
Turn back,  
We can't turn back the hands of time  
It was over,  
The moment that your eyes met mine  
  
And now I find,  
When I'm with you, hours seem like minutes  
You're my whole world,  
Everything that's it in  
Nobody's gonna say goodbye  
  
Baby 'cause I hope it's too late,  
To change your mind,  
'cause I'm never changing mine  
And I, I just gotta say, it's gotta be you,  
Until the end of time  
And I, hope it's too late  
  
Time keeps ticking away  
If I'm right here, never escape  
Baby 'cause I hope it's too late  
Don't wanna say goodbye  
  
Baby 'cause I hope it's too late,  
To change your mind,  
'cause I'm never changing mine  
And I, I just gotta say, it's gotta be you,  
Until the end of time  
And I, hope it's too late  
  
Tell me it's too late,  
And you're already too far gone
