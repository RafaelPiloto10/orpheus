Rockets launch us to outer space  
Far away from this human wasteland  
We're bringing heaven to other worlds  
Abandoning the home fires of our birth  
There are fools who believe we can't live here as one  
There are wise men who say it still can be done  
Chorus:  
I'm watching the world  
I'm watching the change in power  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still?  
We will harvest the fields of wheat  
For a promise of food to eat  
Forging plows to make swords for war  
We can stop this fighting and open the door  
Only fools could believe we can't live here as one  
Who's to say it cannot be done  
Chorus:  
Who is watching this world?  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still?  
Vamp  
Watching the world  
Only fools would believe we can't live here as one  
Who's to say it cannot be done  
Chorus  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still? (just standing still)  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
We're watching the world  
We're building a future  
We're not standing still  
I'm watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
We're building a future  
I'm not standing still  
I'm watching this world  
Watching the world (7x)
