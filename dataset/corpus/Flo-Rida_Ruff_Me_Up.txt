Baby you don't know the girl that's comin' out of me  
I don't recognize this love, I want it ruff, you see  
Boy you know we love each other, always pleasin' one another  
But I have just one request, pull my hair and make me sweat  
  
Do it baby, baby, cure the curiosity  
Hold me down so I'm feelin' the strong velocity  
Throw me up against the wall, roll around until we fall  
Boy, I'm 'bout to shut you up, just want you to ruff me up  
  
So ruff me up, up, baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And you're so hot, I don't wanna stop, stop  
So ruff me up, up, baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And I'm ready to go, so get me down on the floor  
Baby, ruff me up, ruff me up, baby, ruff me up, ruff me up  
  
I don't wanna be sweet 'cause I know that it's mediocrity  
You're the one that I want and I know you should be exploring me  
Pull my hair, go down my back, arch me up and make me crack  
Honey you know that I'm fallin' for you  
But let it release somethin' I wanna do  
  
I can't wait till later baby, want you more and more  
I'm about to jump you when you're walkin' through the door  
Pushin' forward, fuss and fight, keep me up till mornin' light  
Boy, I'm 'bout to shut you up, just want you to rough me up  
  
So ruff me up, up, baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And you're so hot, I don't wanna stop, stop  
So ruff me up, up baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And I'm ready to go, so get me down on the floor  
Baby, ruff me up, ruff me up, baby, ruff me up, ruff me up  
  
Hey, hey, hey shorty, what's your ingredients  
Wet my appetite like I'm Rolling Stones  
Tongue hangin' out of my mouth every time  
My taste buds get in that zone  
  
Lookin' for flavor, I need that recipe  
Whoa, a playa leavin' my legacy  
Lickin' that plate up, she's a delicacy  
After I cater, date her, oops I ate her  
  
Such a lovable hurt  
Strawberry toppin', let's make it dessert  
Play with the moneybags under your skirt  
I heard they got cash there, I said it first  
  
I'm tryin' to bag all those calories  
Tickle miss kitty that's above your knees  
L I C licky whatchu like in me  
Leave a hickey where nobody can see  
  
So ruff me up, up, baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And you're so hot, I don't wanna stop, stop  
So ruff me up, up baby, 'cause you're so tough, baby  
And I'm ready to go, so get me down on the floor  
Baby, ruff me up, ruff me up, baby, ruff me up, ruff me up
