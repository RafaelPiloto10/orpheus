Mistress of the mind  
Take me where the air is clean  
Ignorance is kind  
Emerald and evergreen  
  
30 days September, year of miracle and grief  
Through the haze, Remember  
You're an animal, not a mineral  
  
And we won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war, won the battle  
Won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
Color for the colorblind  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
  
Through the human eye  
Nature a soul extreme  
Nothing seems to die  
Pictures in a magazine  
  
Through the maze, precisely  
Through the myriad of schemes  
With your gaze, entice me  
Like an animal, not a mineral  
  
And we won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war, won the battle  
Won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
Colour for the colourblind  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
  
Through the maze, precisely  
Through the myriad of schemes  
With your gaze, entice me  
Like an animal, not a mineral  
  
And we won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war, won the battle  
Won the war, lost the battle  
Lost the war  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
Color for the colorblind  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble  
Rubbishing the philistines  
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
