Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine.  
  
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Without a seem or needlework  
She once was a true love of mine.  
  
Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
And gather it all with a basket of flowers  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.  
  
Ask her to buy me an acre of land  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Between some water and the stand  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.  
  
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
