I know where I shouldn't be  
You take my heart and drink it for tea  
You mix me up and walk out the door  
You take my love and hutr me for more  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz  
  
Whenever he is around  
He puts me six feet under the ground  
And when you call he can never be found  
'Cause he is always out on the town  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz  
  
He's so funky and he's looking good  
And he does it like a good man should  
And I would love him if only I could  
But his heart is like a piece of wood  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz
