Don't be shy  
Just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear  
'Cause nobody will no you're there  
Just lift your head  
And let your feelings out instead  
And don't be shy  
Just let your feelings roll on by  
  
On by  
On by  
On by  
  
On by  
On by  
On by  
  
You know love  
Is better than a song  
Love is where  
All of us belong  
So don't be shy  
Just let your feelings roll on by  
And don't wear fear  
Or nobody will know you're there  
  
You're there, you're there  
You're there, you're there  
You're there, you're there  
You're there, you're there  
  
So don't be shy  
Just let your feelings roll on by  
And don't wear fear  
Or no one will know you're there  
You know love is better than a song  
Love is where  
All of us belong  
  
Belong  
Belong  
Belong  
Belong
