Oh my majesty  
Can't you rescue me-e-e

Rumors of war  
Talkin' 'bout the coming of my father  
The time is not far  
  
God when I reach home  
How happy I'll be  
Knowing I am home  
Where I am free  
  
Talkin' 'bout war  
And rumors of war  
Talkin' bout the coming of the Negus  
The time is not far  
  
Oh my(3x) majesty

All I see is men's denomination  
Causing complication  
Amongst the younger generation  
  
War  
Rumors of war  
Talkin' 'bout the coming of Jah Jah  
The time is not far  
  
When I reach that place  
Gonna be happy and free  
Knowing I'm in that land  
And I've got my liberty  
  
And I see war in a Beirut  
War in a...

So you can rally around the red, gold and green
