Hey Rusty  
It's a long time  
Remember  
It's like yesterday  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chased us  
Down the boulevards  
Then I got a job  
White collar  
Turn coat  
You just spun around and walked  
Said we wouldn't meet again  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
I feel so young  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
'Cause we're still young  
I just need one friend  
She said hey  
Don't take it so bad  
She said hey  
It wasn't so much  
We just ran out of gas  
Or something like that  
That's when I  
I crashed my car  
Not by chance  
And not out of love  
Then I walked out of that job  
You should've seen their faces  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
I just need one friend  
And we're not finished yet  
No way  
Hey Rusty  
I changed my mind  
What d'you say we start again  
No I mean it this time  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chase us  
Down the boulevards
