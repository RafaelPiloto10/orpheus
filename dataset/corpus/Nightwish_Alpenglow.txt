Once upon a time a song was heard  
Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse  
  
Together we slay another fright  
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past  
Close your eyes and take a peek  
The truth is easy to see  
  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
Hand in hand guiding me into light  
You, the fairy tale guise in blue and white  
  
Together we slay another fright  
Every Jub-jub birds moves soft and fast  
Close your eyes and take a peek  
The truth is easy to see  
  
We were here...  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
You are my path, my home, my star  
A beautiful tale within the tale  
And when the dust needs to move on  
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow  
Painting white, silencing the valley we built  
Together we'll sleep, devoured by life  
  
We were here, roaming the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow
