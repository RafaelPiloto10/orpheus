I was down in Nashville just payin' my dues  
Headed for Ohio when I read the news  
'Bout the people demonstrating 'gainst the President's views  
Four were shot down by the National Guard troops  
Just like Uncle Sam I put on my fighting shoes  
School shot down cause there's no more to lose  
Now we're headed to D.C. two by twos  
Cause those low down, profound, killin' four blues  
Lookin' for my Congressman to make it well known  
But the politicians already won't answer his telephone  
Making in his office while they're shooting kids down at home  
Worried about the voters but he won't be worried long  
Silent majority still glued to the tube  
Say CIA ain't lookin', FBI come unglued  
Shot some more in Jackson just to show the world what they can do  
While we're marching to D.C. cause there's too much to do  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
There's no turnin' back my friend  
There's no turnin' back  
When the President said that the tear gas is gone  
The army's pulled out leavin' blood on the ground  
The streets are empty and the crying's died down  
You can be President if no one's around  
Just like Kow Kow, you've heard it before  
Get back gangster, don't you open that door  
Space Cowboy's back to tell you the score  
Nothing any good is gonna come from a war  
Got those low down, profound, killin' four blues  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance
