Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read  
  
Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read  
  
I'm on your side  
Nowhere to hide  
Trapdoors that open  
I spiral down  
  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
  
I'm lost at sea  
Don't bother me  
I've lost my way  
I've lost my way  
  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
This beautiful world  
  
Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read
