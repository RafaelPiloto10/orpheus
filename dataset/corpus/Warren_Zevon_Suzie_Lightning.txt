Written by Warren Zevon1991 Zevon Music  
She only sleeps on planes  
She's tired of going nowhere  
She's in Yugoslavia  
Working in a miniseries  
Suzie Lightning  
I built a world for her  
Suzie lightning  
I need a girl from earth  
She's in Hungary  
She sends post cards home  
Does she think of me?  
I'm in Hollywood  
Suzie Lightning  
Takes no prisoners  
Suzie Lightning  
No use crying about it  
No use trying to hold on  
She lights up the sky  
Then she's gone  
She don't have time for love  
She don't need me now  
Can't she see I'm burning up  
Burning down, burning out  
Suzie Lightning  
I built a world for her  
Suzie Lightning  
I need a girl from earth
