Down the road there was a man walking, walking  
Knapsack round his back radio talking, talking  
And his blue suede shoes are covered in mud, but it no matter cause the boys
on the run  
Black sunglasses and a bald head too, boy never had nowhere to run when it was
cold, so cold  
So he hitched a ride to New Mexico, wanted to try for the big brass show  
  
But no  
He's the wanderer looking for his long lost home  
He's only got one place to go  
He's wandering and wondering when to go home  
He's not alone, not alone, not alone  
Feet been walking for a thousand years, trying to drive away those fears, but
no  
Well then he picked up and then he went down south  
Dad said nothing and mom shut her mouth  
Well, he never thought too much, just thought he could heal with his touch  
For those who need help and more love  
And when love came around I heard the sound  
Wanderers wandering all round the town  
  
But no, they go  
He's the wanderer looking for his long lost home  
He's only got one place to go  
He's wandering and wondering when to go home  
He's not alone, not alone, not alone  
Hey, he's the wanderer looking for his long lost home  
He's only got one fine place to go  
He's wandering wondering when to go home  
He's not alone, not alone, not alone  
We wan wan wandered along, grabbed our friends and we move along  
We won won won the war, grabbed our friends and we ran for the door
