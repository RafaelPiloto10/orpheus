I got my head but my head is unraveling  
Can't keep control can't keep track of where it's traveling  
I got my heart but my heart's no good  
You're the only one that's understood  
I come along but I don't know where you're taking me  
I shouldn't go but you reaching back and shaking me  
Turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky  
The more I give to you the more I die  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug  
The perfect drug, the perfect drug  
You make me hard when I'm all soft inside  
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed  
The arrow goes straight through my heart  
Without you everything just falls apart  
My blood just wants to say hello to you  
My soul is so afraid to realize  
How every little bit is left of me  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug the perfect drug  
Take me with you  
Without you everything just falls apart  
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
