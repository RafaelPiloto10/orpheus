I took, one look, in your eyes tonight,  
And I saw, it all there in a different light,  
Just when I thought I was out of the rain,  
Suddenly I'm in a hurricane,  
And all around me voices in the wind.  
  
Say again, what I know I know,  
It's time, it's time, to learn about letting go,  
Why does it feel like I just exist,  
Stuck out here on the precipice?  
  
They say the future's out of our hands,  
So why is it making demands?  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
I knew a man, I held his hand,  
When I was just a child,  
He showed me his dreams  
I watched him let 'em die  
  
If I could stand again by his side,  
I'd tell him that love is why we're alive,  
That's what I tell the world I believe,  
So why can't I listen to me?  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
Welcome to sunrise in paradise,  
The light of the dawn, is burning my eyes,  
And that's just where I want it to be.  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
If I finally get to make up my mind,  
Girl then now is the time to decide.  
Somebody tell me why I do this to me,  
Why must it be now or never?
