Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Shake it up, up rock ya body  
Make it knock, knock when you partyin'  
Take a break, break in the audience  
Do ya footwork break and stop again?  
  
I'm lookin' sharp  
You can't compete with the champ  
Steady flickin'  
I'm holdin' done that layaway rack  
  
Aye, rhinestones all in they face  
Gold charms and paper chase  
Talk smack from around the way  
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place  
  
I ain't rockin' no stupid, babes  
I ain't trippin', I juke all day  
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way  
When I hit the block all the people say  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Aye yo this mothafucka jammin', I'm on it, it's a anthem  
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras  
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas  
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's  
  
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome  
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man  
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit  
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty  
Fast forward to the end of my song  
And say third verse me, verse me  
Whenever I hit the block I see  
  
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me  
From manicure sets to silky weaves  
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus  
Turkey, germy, dirty  
  
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no  
Let the pioneer blast my shit  
Wait a minute, hold up, nigga  
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh  
  
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa  
Acrylic base, top all gold  
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes  
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
