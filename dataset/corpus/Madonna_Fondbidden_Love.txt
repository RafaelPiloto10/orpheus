Just one kiss on my lips  
Was all it took to seal the future  
Just one look from your eyes  
Was like a certain kind of torture  
  
Once upon a time  
There was a boy and there was a girl  
Just one touch from your hands  
Was all it took to make me falter  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one smile on your face  
Was all it took to change my fortune  
Just one word from your mouth  
Was all I needed to be certain  
  
Once upon a time  
There was a boy, there was a girl  
Hearts that intertwine  
They lived in a different kind of world  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one kiss, just one touch, just one look  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one kiss, just one touch, just one look, just one love  
  
One
