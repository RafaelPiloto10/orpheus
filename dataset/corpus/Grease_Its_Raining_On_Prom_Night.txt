I was deprived of a young girl's dream  
By the cruel force of nature from the blue  
Instead of a night full of romance supreme  
All I got was a running nose and Asiatic 'flu  
  
It's raining on prom night, my hair is a mess  
It's running all over my taffeta dress  
It's wilting the quilting on my maiden form  
And mascara flows right down my nose, because of the storm  
  
I don't even have my corsage, oh gee  
It fell down a sewer with my sister's ID  
  
Yes, it's raining on prom night, oh my darling, what can I do? I miss you  
It's raining rain from the skies  
And it's raining real tears from my eyes, over you  
Oh dear God, make him feel the same way I do right now  
Make him want to see me again - oh what can I do  
  
It's raining rain from the skies, it's raining tears from my eyes over you  
Raining, ooh tears from my eyes over you  
Raining, ooh raining on prom night  
Ooh raining, ooh tears from my eyes over you  
Ooh raining, ooh raining on prom night...
