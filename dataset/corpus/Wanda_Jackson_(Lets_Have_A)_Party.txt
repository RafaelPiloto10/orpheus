Some people like to rock, some people like to roll  
But movin' and a-groovin's gonna satisfy my soul  
Let's have a party  
Hoo, let's have a party  
Well, send 'im to the store Let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight  
I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a coon  
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room  
Let's have a party  
Hoo, let's have a party  
Well, send 'im to the store Let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight  
I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a goon (?)  
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room  
Let's have a party  
Hoo, let's have a party  
Well, send 'im to the store Let's buy some more  
Let's have a party tonight  
Honky-Tonky' Joe is knockin' at the door

Let's have a party  
Hoo, let's have a party  
Well, send 'im to the store Let's buy some more

Everybody run, they got the possum in the pot  
Let's have a party  
Hoo, let's have a party
