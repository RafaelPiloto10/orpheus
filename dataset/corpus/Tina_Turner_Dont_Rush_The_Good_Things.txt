Bought me a bottle of wine  
I'm gonna drink it tonight  
And you can join me  
It's gonna make us feel alright  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
I'm gonna sip it slowly  
I'm not gonna rock it back  
I am no historier but I  
I've learned from my past what I've learned  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
It's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job  
Don't rush good things tonight  
You and me baby  
No need to rush it tonight  
'Cause we got all the time in the world  
To get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get, get, get, get, get it, get it, get  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
'Cause it's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job, tonight  
It's a slow job falling in love  
I said, it's a slow job, tonight  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get it, get it, get it, get it  
Get it, get it, get it, get it  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things tonight  
I said we got all the time in the world  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get, get, get, get, get it, get it, get
