[Verse 1]  
Stay in the shadows  
Cheer at the gallows  
This is a round up  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
This is a low flying panic attack  
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Burn the witch  
Burn the witch  
We know where you live  
  
[Verse 2]  
Red crosses on wooden doors  
And if you float you burn  
Loose talk around tables  
Abandon all reason  
Avoid all eye contact  
Do not react  
Shoot the messengers  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
This is a low flying panic attack  
Sing the song of sixpence that goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Burn the witch  
Burn the witch  
We know where you live  
We know where you live
