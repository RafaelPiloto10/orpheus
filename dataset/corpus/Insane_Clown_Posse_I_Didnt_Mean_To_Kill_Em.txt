This is the story of a murderer  
A cold blooded killer, a ruthless, harmless, slaughterer  
I didn't mean to kill him, listen to me, wait  
I was talkin' to a fine ass date, ha ha ha  
Phat titties, lookin like pow  
And she's tellin me to come by right now  
Oh shit, I jumped in the wagon  
No more laggin', I'm taggin'  
This bitch, dead in the ping hole  
Make her lose control  
I showed up, I ring the ding dong  
Grippin' my wing wong, something's wrong  
Who's this, not a bitch, but a dude  
And he's tellin me to beat it, fuckin' rude  
It's Jimmy, her man, a punk ass  
So I throw a left hook at him, splat  
Then I came back with a right hook  
Pow, he fell to the ground, I didn't mean to kill him  
What the hell did you do to Jimmy?  
Oh, my God  
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
Oh fuck, he's chillin' with a neck broke  
25 to life, is no joke  
Don't die, bitch, hang in there  
I mean I really don't care, but come on  
Move quick, I run to the hospital  
Make sure he ain't dead yet, shit  
There he is, chillin' with a neck brace  
With a look on his face like  
Come on Jimmy, it's me, your homey  
I even poured a little brew in your IV  
Don't die, oh you tryin' to speak  
Fuck you, your punches are weak, eheh  
So bitch, you wanna talk shit again  
I jumped up wit a boot to the chin  
Pull his plugs out and start chokin'  
Eww, his necks already broken  
He swung, hit me wit' a bed pan  
I was just makin sure you ain't dead man  
Fuck this, I grabbed a scalpel  
And stick it down in his scalp, uuh  
Calm down, he's dead now, fuck  
Here comes somebody, better duck  
Gotta hide dead Jimmy quickly  
Or 25 to 50, I didn't mean to kill him  
Oh, my god Jimmy, what the fuck?  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
Jumped out the window and drug him home,  
Jimmy's dead and I'm finna get the bone  
If they catch me, ah the death chair  
I don't care they'll never find him here  
Jimmy will you get that  
What the fuck, he's dead, I'm whick whack  
I'm neverous, scared and skitso  
Ha ha ha, woo, ha, hello

Oh goody, they bought it, hah, they'll never know  
I killed his bitch ass  
Fuck it though, Jimmy's my room mate  
He doesn't even eat much and that's straight  
We just chill all day, watch video's  
Call Domino's and flick off his toes  
Make 'em land into a fish tank, what you think?  
Let him sit, fuck off, I didn't mean to kill him  
Oh my God, you bastard, you killed Jimmy  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby  
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby  
This was the story of a murderer  
A cold blooded killer, a ruthless, harmless, slaughterer
