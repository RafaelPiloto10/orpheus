I had troubles aplenty,  
My pockets were empty  
From livin' out on the sidewalk.  
Footsteps takin' me nowhere,  
But where can you go when you don't know  
What it is you're lookin' for?  
Just as I was a desperate man  
You made the sun start to shine,  
You said,"baby, come in from the rain".  
You could see down the stitches and patches  
That were holdin' me together,  
So with stolen faces, hand in hand,  
We made footsteps together for musicland.  
Used to be I had troubles aplenty,  
My pockets were empty, yeah,  
From the bad life on the back streets.  
But when your footsteps are takin' you nowhere  
Where can you go and what can you do  
When you don't know what you're lookin' for?  
Hey, just as I reached the real world  
You made the sun start to shine,  
You said,"baby, come in out of the rain".  
Oh, yeah, I said you made the sun start to shine,  
Oh, baby, come in from the rain.
