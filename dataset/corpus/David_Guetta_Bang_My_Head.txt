[Sia:]  
I was bound, was tired  
Hadn't seen a light so long  
Thought I lost my fight  
Couldn't find my way back home  
And I found the light stepping out of me  
I was bound, and tired  
Waiting for daylight  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed  
I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead I rose above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you think you're giving up  
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't  
And you feel the love stepping out of you  
But when you think of giving up, don't  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang your head up against the wall  
You may feel light headed, but you won't crawl, no, you won't fall  
You will rise above it all  
You'll find what you're searching for  
And you may feel light headed  
You think you're gonna hit the floor  
Instead you rise above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang your head against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead you rise above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Bridge:]  
I have broken wings  
I keep trying, keep trying  
No one get out  
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed, I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head against the wall  
Bang my head against the wall  
Instead I rise above it all
