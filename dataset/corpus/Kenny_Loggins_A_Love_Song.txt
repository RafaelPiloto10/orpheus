There's a wren in a willow wood  
Flies so high and sings so good  
And he brings to you what he sings to you  
And the love in his lullaby  
Seem to tell me if I try, I could fly for you  
Lover I wanna try for you 'cause  
  
I wanna sing you a love song  
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home  
  
Summer thunder on moon-bright days  
Northern lights and skies ablaze I bring to you  
If you let me sing to you  
Silver wings in a fiery sky  
Show the trail of my love and I sing to you  
Love is what I bring to you  
I wanna sing to you, oh  
  
I wanna sing you a love song  
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home  
  
I wanna sing you a love song  
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
