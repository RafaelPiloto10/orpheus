"Abigail, I know You're in control of her brain, Abigail  
And I know that You're the one that's  
speaking through her, Abigail  
Miriam can You hear me"  
  
"I am alive inside Your Wife  
Miriam's dead, I am her head."  
  
"Abigail, don't You think I know what  
You've done, Abigail  
I'll get a priest, he will know  
How to get her soul back"  
  
"Oh Jonathan, this is Miriam  
Our time is out  
Remember the stairs, it's the only way"  
  
"Abigail, nothing I can do but give in, Abigail"  
  
"Jonathan, I agree...Yes I do"  
  
"I am alive inside Your Wife  
Miriam's dead, I am her head, soon I'll be free!"
