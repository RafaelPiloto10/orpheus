You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
Why it's quarter past eleven  
And you're sleeping on the bedroom floor  
  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
You must of swallowed a candle  
Or some other kind of surprise  
  
I'm going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
I'm going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
All the women in Memphis  
Want to see how long my money will last  
  
I'm going downtown  
I'm gonna to rattle somebody's cage  
  
I'm going downtown  
I'm gonna rattle somebody's cage  
I'm gonna beat on my guitar  
And strut all around the stage  
  
If you see my baby coming  
Don't tell her that her daddy's in jail  
If you see my baby coming  
Don't you tell her that her daddy's in jail  
She'd sell her little pumpkin just to raise  
Her sweet daddy's bail  
  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You never do nothing  
To save your doggone soul.
