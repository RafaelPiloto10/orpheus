She cries just a little when she sees him walk away  
After all, she can't see it any other way  
And it's hard when you're feelin' like there's nothin' left to lose  
No she can't help it, she sees no excuse  
There's no good in her goodbye  
There's no tears she hasn't cried  
But it's not enough  
She needs nothin' less than love  
Don't say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love  
You can't stand in the middle and see it either way  
That's just how it is, no one ever wants the blame  
So she'll pick up the pieces and pretend she just can't see  
Cause all she's looking for is some room to breathe  
She knows better than to wait  
Just keep waiting until it's too late  
There's no good in her goodbye  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love  
Don't say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love
