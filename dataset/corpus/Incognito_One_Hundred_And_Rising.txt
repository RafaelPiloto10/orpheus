Out in the heat little child  
On the streets runnin' wild  
Barely ten, got a gun  
So now he thinks that he's a man  
Yes he does  
  
Teenage girl out to steal  
''cause her baby is in need of a meal  
Tryin' to cope as best she can  
In the high sunshine, low on hope  
  
Well, there it is summer in the city  
Tryin' to make sense of a world gone crazy  
  
[Chorus:]  
(du do do do do du)  
One hundred and risin'  
(du do do do do du)  
So the tale is told  
(du do do do do du)  
One hundred and risin'  
(du do do do do du)  
  
Old man sitting in the shade  
Won't take part in the charade  
He may be old, but he ain't a foo  
L he has seen how dreams are bought and sold  
  
On every corner, a steady stream  
To buy a thrill, a piper's dream  
While the heat takes its toll  
It's just another day on a city street  
  
You got to do the best you can to get by  
In the high sunshine  
  
[Chorus: x 3]  
Summer madness will unfold  
Tryin' to make sense of a world gone crazy  
Repeat (fade)
