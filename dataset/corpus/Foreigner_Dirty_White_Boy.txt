Hey baby, if you're feeling down, I know what's good for you all day  
Are you worried what your friends see  
And will it ruin your reputation loving me?  
'Cause I'm a dirty white boy, yeah a dirty white boy, a dirty white boy  
Don't drive no big black car, don't like no Hollywood movie stars  
You want me to be true to you, you don't give a damn what I do to you  
I'm just a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy  
  
Well I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy  
A dirty white boy  
I've been in trouble since I don't know when  
I'm in trouble now and I know somehow I'll find trouble again  
I'm a loner but I'm never alone  
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone  
Cause I'm a dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy  
I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy  
Come on come on boy, white boy, I'm a dirty white boy, a dirty white boy  
Hey I'm a dirty white boy, yeah I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, yeah!
