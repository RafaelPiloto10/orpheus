Cold wind blowing over your private parts I know a lack you've got and it
makes a strong case for art billboard breasts, they  
Don't have a face, I know that fact you've got, no girl could ever trace
lionized, smoking just a little too violently I know that  
Fact I've got and I know it single-mindedly stupid, stoned cause and effect I
know a lack you've got and you don't even lack it  
Yet lionized, lionize  
  
I can't draw, but I can trace I know a lack I've got, an abundance of extra
space cold wind blowing over your private parts I  
Know a lack you've got is to make a strong case for art lionized, lionize
