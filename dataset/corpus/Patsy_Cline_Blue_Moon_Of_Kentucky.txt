I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
It was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright  
Whispered on high, love said goodbye  
  
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright  
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye  
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Left me blue  
Left me blue  
Left me blue
