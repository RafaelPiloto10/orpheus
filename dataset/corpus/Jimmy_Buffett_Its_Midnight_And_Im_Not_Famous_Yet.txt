Catch the elevator from the penthouse suite  
And take it down to the casino  
The God almighty sound of money moving round  
Can be heard all the way to Reno  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well it's midnight and I'm not famous yet  
Trying to win it all with one more bet  
Nothing can stop my thirty-two hop  
Or my ten dollar yo-yo-yo  
It's midnight and I'm just getting ready to go  
Lester Polyester signs another marker  
Like the high rollers do  
Seven come eleven  
His brand new baby needs Gucci shoes  
Well it's midnight and she's not famous yet  
  
Trying to break the bank with one more bet  
Nothing can stop my thirty-two hop  
Or my ten dollar yo-yo-yo  
It's midnight and Lester's getting ready to roll  
  
They're paging someone we know  
Lester hits a Keno  
He's not leaving yet  
Vacuum cleaners humming lounge act still is strumming  
It's their twenty fourth set  
Well it's midnight and they're not famous yet  
Trying to win with one last bet  
Nothing can stop my thirty-two hop  
Or my ten dollar yo-yo-yo  
It's midnight got nowhere to go
