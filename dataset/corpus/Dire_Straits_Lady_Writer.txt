Lady Writer on the TV  
Talk about the Virgin Mary  
Reminded me of you  
Expectations left to come up to yeah  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Yeah, she had another quality  
The way you used to look  
And I know you never read a book  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face  
Then I recall my fall from grace  
Another time, another place  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She had all the brains and the beauty  
The picture does not fit  
You talked to me when you felt like it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes and your rich old man  
You know he'd call her a dead ringer  
You got the same command  
Plus you mother was a jazz singer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She knew all about a history  
You couldn't hardly write your name  
I think I want you just the same as the  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV
