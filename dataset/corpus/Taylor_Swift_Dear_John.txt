Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps,  
Praying the floor won't fall through, again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind,  
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game,  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you
can"  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home  
  
Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong  
Don't you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?  
I should've known  
  
You are an expert at sorry,  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry  
Have tired, lifeless eyes  
'Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,  
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.  
  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You should've known, you should've known  
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known
