I never look higher  
Than I could see  
Never gave less  
Than you have given me  
The more you have taken  
you turned into fakes  
I finally know now why for Heaven's sake?  
  
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried  
Don't act so deaf and blind  
Don't think that if someones made dumb to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
Now you call me liar  
'Cause you are just the  
"Always have right fools majority"  
I think that it's someones  
start at your side  
you'd all turn your back  
Won't give any dime  
  
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried  
Don't act so deaf and blind  
Don't think that if someones made sad to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
From where the rain grows  
I know where the rain grows  
I'm back from where the rain grows
