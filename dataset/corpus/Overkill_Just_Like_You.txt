It's just like you to talk when I'm not around.  
It's just like you to kick me when I'm down.  
Symptoms of your lunacy,  
Tryin' to be what you can't be!  
I don't want to end up just like you.  
  
I can't hear you,  
I can't see you,  
I won't hear you.  
  
It's just like you to think you're playin' god.  
It's just like me to know you're not.  
Weakening with every day,  
Turn down the sound and fade away,  
No I'll never end up just like you!!!  
  
I don't need you!  
I can read you,  
Never need you.  
You can't see me!  
You can't bleed me.  
Cold and empty,  
Just like you.  
  
There lies a fallen man...  
Fallen by his own hand!  
Once the way it used to be...  
Believed in you but now I'm free!  
I believed in you but now I'm free!  
Now I'm free!  
  
It's just like you  
I don't need you!  
I can read you,  
Never need you.  
You can't see me!  
You can't read me.  
I set me free!  
Just like you
