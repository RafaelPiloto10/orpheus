Ribbons of blue  
Remind me of you  
Ribbons of red  
Are the way that my heart bled  
Memories so clear  
Are still ringing in my ears  
So I wanna send to you  
My ol' ribbons of blue  
  
Ribbons of blue  
Now remind me of you  
Ribbons of red  
Are the way that my heart bled  
Memories so clear  
Are still ringing in my ear  
So I wanna send to you  
My ol' ribbons of blue  
  
Got me a ribbon  
Bright blue ribbon for my hair  
Made me a promise  
Now I know he didn't care  
Touched by his first kiss  
Fooled by his first song  
The way he led me along  
With my ribbons undone  
  
Ribbons of blue  
Now remind me of you  
Ribbons of red  
Are the way that my heart bled  
Memories so clear  
Are still ringing in my ear  
So I wanna send to you  
My ol' ribbons of blue  
  
Sad for me baby  
So bad for me baby ohh  
Hard on me baby  
So far from me baby ohh  
  
Ribbons of blue  
Now remind me of you  
Ribbons of red  
Are the way that my heart bled  
Memories so clear  
Are still ringing in my ears  
So I wanna send to you  
My ol' ribbons of blue
