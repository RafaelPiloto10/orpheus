There's the snow,  
Look out below,  
And bundle up 'cause here it comes,  
Run outside,  
So starry-eyed,  
A snowball fight breaks out,  
And winter has finally begun...  
  
I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace 'til I slip on the sidewalk
and fall on my face,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar-sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?  
  
Hop in the sleigh,  
And we'll glide away into the night,  
And we'll sip on moonlight,  
Runny nose,  
My frosty toes are getting cold but I feel alive so I smile wide  
  
The snowflakes start falling and I start to float 'til my mean older brother
stuffs snow down my coat,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?
