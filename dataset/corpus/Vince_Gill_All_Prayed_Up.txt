I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I made my peace with Jesus a long, long time ago  
Trusted in Him that He would save my soul  
I walked up there beside Him, He guides me me on my way  
And I know He hears me when I kneel and pray  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
Now I ain't afraid of Satan, his wicked ways of sin  
They tempted me but he couldn't pull me in  
When I've gone to live with Jesus, face my judgment day  
He'll fulfill for me the promise that He made  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die
