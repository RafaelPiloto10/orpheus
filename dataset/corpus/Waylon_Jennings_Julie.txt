When I married Julie she was just seventeen  
Pretty as the answer to any man's dream  
  
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I've had  
Though everyone told me that Julie was bad  
Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight  
Drinking and dancin' around late at night  
She was everything evil with the face of a child  
But I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild  
I had built me an empire with my own two hands  
With the money and power to break any man  
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't
control  
I gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't try  
She'd only laugh then walk out the door  
Each time she'd hurt me made me love her more  
  
Now I'm locked in this room they say I'm insane  
And I guess that I'll never see my Julie again  
I'm a man with a heart and a tormented soul  
And the mind that Julie drove out of control
