I am pleading tonight in this letter I write  
'Cause it seems as tho' I'm talking to you,  
All the tear-stains you see take as kisses from me,  
'Cause I'm lonesome here waiting for you.  
  
Does your heart still feel light do you still think your right  
That you left me for one you thought true  
After years we have known leaving me here alone  
So lonesome just waiting for you.  
  
I treasure each thought every memory old pal  
That we spent in the days we once knew  
And it hurt so inside many times I have cried.  
So heartbroken just waiting waiting for you.  
  
But perhaps dear someday when the clouds drift away  
And the sunshine again fills the blue  
You'll mend the break in my heart once again we will start  
From where I've waited so worried and blue.
