Albatross  
Show me a dream of love  
Albatross  
Without her love I'm lost  
Good love never dies  
Angels never fly so high  
I'm dreaming, dreaming  
Coming back to me  
  
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere, take care  
I'm stranded in a struggle of my dreams, it seems  
Baby, oh I need you more  
Like roses need the rain  
Baby, oh I need you more  
Come and take my hand  
  
Albatross  
Harder I try, bluer I get  
Albatross  
Don't leave me alone I'm sad  
Oh, I find my home  
Right back where I started from  
I'm dreaming, dreaming  
Coming back to me  
  
I'm stranded  
Nobody cries, time's on my side  
I'm stranded  
I don't know where but you're not there  
I'm stranded  
Playing the fool, breaking the rules  
I'm stranded  
Take up your hand, make me a friend
