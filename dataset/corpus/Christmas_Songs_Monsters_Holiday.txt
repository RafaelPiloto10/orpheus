'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the castle  
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle  
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things  
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
But they were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monsters should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
They were making a list and checking it twice  
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike  
A new chain for Yarnush  
A brace for Igor's back  
A speed shaver for Wolfman  
A new cape for Drac  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monster's should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof  
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof  
As Santa slid down the chimney wall  
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all  
  
From beyond the moat there arose such a clatter  
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter  
Like a bolt of lightning it happened so quick  
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick  
  
He began to dig down deep in his sack  
And came up with the traction for Igor's back  
Drac got his cape  
Franky's trike made him behave  
Even Wolfman was happy now he can shave  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And all ended well  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And Santa was really swell  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
No need to rob Santa's sleigh  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Maybe next year he'll come back  
  
So the children everywhere were spared the grief  
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief  
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave  
And never again rob sleighs or graves  
  
[Repeat "it was a monster's holiday" in background with the following:]  
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?  
"Arrrrrr... Santa good!"  
And Santa said as he drove out of sight  
  
[Dracula accent:]  
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho  
Merry Christmas to all  
And to all a good night - blaaaa! "  
  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
Where is that reindeer with the red nose, blaaaa  
On Donner, on Blitzen, on Dancer...
