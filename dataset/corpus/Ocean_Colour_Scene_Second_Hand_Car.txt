In a second hand car you ran away with him  
You didn't get too far before he made you cry  
And he beat on you, oh, he never treated you  
More something on his shoe walk on by, on by  
It's time, time to run away from him  
A man don't act that way and you know he'll never change  
It's a way to love, knocked down and bruises too  
And it's a way for him to knock down and use you  
I'll send a ticket to you, I'll send the fare to you  
I'll say a prayer for you, and it makes me cry, me cry  
It's time, time to run away from him  
A man don't act that way and you know he'll never change  
It's time, time for you to come on home  
But the world don't seem that way and you know it'll never change  
Never change, never change  
It's such a rare report, ah, she got lost on him  
I get lost in thought, hope she walks on by  
I'll make the time to give, if you don't give a damn  
We'll make a home and live without you and we can  
It's time, time to run away from him  
A man don't act that way and you know he'll never change  
It's time, time for you to come on home  
But the world don't seem that way and you know it'll never change  
Never change, never, never, never, never change  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on
