I'm living in a bad dream.  
They're supposed to be here by now.  
What the hell is taking them so long?  
I parked the car just like they said.  
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bullet in my head.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm supposed to be feeling better by now.  
What the hell is taking me so long?  
I hit the hay just like they said.  
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bell in my head.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
On a curve, lost control.  
On a cliff, lost control.  
This is not happening to me.  
I say so.  
I'm supposed to be a better person by now.  
What the hell is taking me so long?  
Dying saviors off sum cross.  
Now, I'm hoping and I'm praying that they'll nullify my losses.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.
