Seventeen and strung out on confusion  
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
  
Secrets collecting dust but never forget  
Skeletons come to life in my closet  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
What's happening to me  
  
Seventeen and coming clean for the first time  
I finally figured out myself for the first time  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
What's happened to me
