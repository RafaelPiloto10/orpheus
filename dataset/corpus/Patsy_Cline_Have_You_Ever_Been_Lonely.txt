Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
Have you ever loved someone just as I love you  
Can't you see I'm sorry for each mistake I've made  
Can't you see I've changed dear can't you see I've paid  
  
Be a little forgiving take me back in your heart  
How can I go on living now that we're apart  
If you knew what I've been through then you'd know why I ask you  
Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
  
If you knew what I've been through...
