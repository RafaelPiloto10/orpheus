Bridge:  
When your groove comes down on you  
You can do what you wanna do  
When your groove comes down on yo  
You can do what you wanna do  
  
There's a lot of dancin' going round  
You tried them all and put some down  
Everybody's got their own way of movin'  
It don't matter as long as we're groovin'  
  
Chorus:  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
  
Bridge  
  
Can you move it around and let me see it?  
Just walk over here and I'll get down with ya  
Keep on now, let's keep groovin'  
You better come on and get down to it  
  
Chorus  
  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
Keep on movin' around, let me see it  
Just walk over here and I'll get down with ya  
  
Keep puttin' it out, let's keep groovin'  
Everybody come on get down do it  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
  
Walk on  
The rockway
