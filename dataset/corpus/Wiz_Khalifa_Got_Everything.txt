Baby I go, hard so hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on
my job  
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone  
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all 'cause we done made
it, too far  
Got something to say then fuck 'em ain't trying to lose out on all of this for
nothing  
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'ma get  
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent  
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich  
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit  
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since  
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips, wit'  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything)  
  
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring  
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me  
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you  
Take you places where they using different language to greet you  
Smile and shake when they meet you  
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get
enough of me  
'Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me  
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me  
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want  
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me  
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'ma need it in a rush  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more  
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure  
You don't even have to call me, just say my name  
I'll be right there waiting for you  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
