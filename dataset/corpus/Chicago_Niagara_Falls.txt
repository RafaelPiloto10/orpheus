Baby, so you think you can start again?  
You got somebody new,  
But the same thing keeps happening.  
At the moment of truth,  
Whoever you're loving,  
You will be thinking of me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
As long as Niagara falls,  
As long as Gibraltar stands,  
'Til Hell freezes over  
I'll always be your man.  
  
Tell me, when you're there lying by his side.  
Do you make him believe all your needs have been satisfied?  
Does he know that your heart is taken forever?  
Girl, you will always be mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time can't erase  
What you feel in your heart  
You can't replace the love  
No, it doesn't matter how hard you try.  
Girl, you're gonna miss my loving till the day you die.  
'Til Hell freezes over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as Niagara falls,  
Until the end of time,  
'Til Hell freezes over,  
You are forever mine.  
  
[Chorus]
