I have been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer  
Tragedy and misery are what makes my career  
Watery graves are my stock and trade, but it's getting harder  
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  
There hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965  
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive  
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  
They pass by, the boat survives, only my career's in tatters  
They're building ships too good today, and I'm the one who suffers  
They don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
There once were found, twenty in town, who wrote about shipwrecks  
When boats sank lots, just like rocks, 'twas good as it gets  
But the golden ages passed away and I'm barely survivin'  
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin' in advertisin'  
They're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me  
Why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  
You may think it well and good, but my livelihood sails away  
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  
That government bastard's been sent to take my job from me  
That inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy  
He can try, no way will I ever give up hope  
When he went by, I did pry a big hole in his boat  
They're building ships too good today, so I helped one along  
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  
Of a man afloat a sinking boat, who knows he will die today  
You might think it bad not good, but my livelihood's here to stay  
It's here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
