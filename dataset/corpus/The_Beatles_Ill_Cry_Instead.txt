I've got every reason on earth to be mad  
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had  
If I could get my way  
I'd get myself locked up today  
But I can't, so I'll cry instead  
  
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet  
I can't talk to people that I meet  
If I could see you now  
I'd try to make you sad somehow  
But I can't, so I'll cry instead  
  
Don't want to cry when there's people there  
I get shy when they start to stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away  
But I'll come back again someday  
  
And when you do you'd better hide all the girls  
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two  
And show you what your lovin' man can do  
Until then I'll cry instead
