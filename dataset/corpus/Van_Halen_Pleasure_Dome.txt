Now I know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened  
I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery  
Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it, so I followed it  
I'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles  
Into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Rooms without doors open for me, oh no  
Taking me miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome  
Oh man, I ain't got a clue, how you get out, or how to find this place  
I want my control back, but I'm afraid, I'll lose that feeling  
Lost in a world so far from home, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome  
  
Lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere  
Millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere  
Miles and miles and miles and miles, oh  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome, yeah  
Lost, lost
