We talked and talked and talked and talked for hours  
An ocean or two couldn't keep me away from you  
We spoke about the time and place of our first meeting  
Without a word I know you knew that I cared about you  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
Been one too many lonely nights without you  
On one too many trains and boats and 'planes  
I spent a thousand nights alone before I met you  
And I'll spend many more until we meet again  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much
