I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
Honey, I saw you there last night  
Another woman's arms, holding you tight  
Nobody knows what I feel inside  
All I know, that I walked away and cried  
I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, oh, nothin' but dreams to remember  
I know you said she was just your friend  
But I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly?  
'Cause I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, oh, dreams to remember  
Hey, and I, and I still want you to stay  
I still love you anyway, anyway  
I don't want you, ever to leave  
'Cause boy, you satisfy me, oh  
I know you said she was just a friend  
I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
And these eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly?  
'Cause I've got dreams, dreams, dreams to remember  
Oh, I've got dreams, oh, I've got dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, oh, oh, oh, oh baby  
Beautiful, wonderful dreams, I've got 'em to remember  
And I've got dreams, dreams to remember
