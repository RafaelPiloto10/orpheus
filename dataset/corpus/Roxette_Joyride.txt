Hit the road out of nowhere, I had to jump my car  
and be a rider in the love game following the stars.  
don't need no book of wisdom, I get no money talk at all.  
She has a train going downtown, she's got a club on the moon  
and she's telling all her secrets in a wonderful balloon.  
  
Oh she's the heart of the funfair,  
she's got me whistling her private tune.  
And it all begins where it ends,  
and she's all mine, my magic friend  
  
She says: Hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride  
  
She's a flower, I can paint her, she's a child of the sun,  
we're a part of this together, could never turn around and run.  
Don't need no fortune teller  
to know where my lucky love belongs oh no.  
Cos it all begins again when it ends,  
and we're all magic friends  
  
She says: hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, be a joyrider  
  
I take you on a skyride,  
a feeling like you're spellbound.  
The sunshine is a lady  
who rox you like a baby.  
  
She says: hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride
