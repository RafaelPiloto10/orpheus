I only knew you for a while  
I never saw your smile  
Till it was time to go  
Time to go away (time to go away)  
Sometimes it's hard to recognise  
Love comes as a surprise  
And it's too late  
It's just too late to stay  
Too late to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
We'll always be together  
However far it seems  
(Love never ends)  
We'll always be together  
Together in electric dreams  
  
Because the friendship that you gave  
Has taught me to be brave  
No matter where I go, I'll never find a better prize  
(Find a better prize)  
Though you're miles and miles away  
I see you every day  
I don't have to try  
I just close my eyes  
I close my eyes  
  
[Chorus]
