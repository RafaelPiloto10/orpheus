Oh, yes  
A kiss in the dark  
A certain time I can call you  
A letter of love  
But no name did you sign  
Pretending to all  
That we were just friends when I saw you  
I didn't know that you wanted me to be  
I didn't know that you wanted me for your  
(For your) To be  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
You should've let me know, from the first time baby  
That you were not, were not free to love  
How could you wait so long  
Oh, what a waste of love, baby  
I should known that you wanted me to be  
I should known  
That you wanted me for your (for your) to be  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
I won't be you secret love  
'Cause it's just a waste of my love  
I'm tellin' you from the start  
I won't be the one who gives you love  
When your other guy ain't givin' you none  
  
Don't come now, wait for awhile  
Let's meet at the place downtown  
It's a shame it has to be like this  
But I really miss you baby  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)
