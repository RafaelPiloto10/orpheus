The water is wide,  
I can't cross over,  
And neither have I wings to fly.  
Build me a boat  
That can carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I.  
  
There is a ship  
And she sails the sea.  
She's loaded deep,  
As deep can be.  
But not so deep  
As the love I'm in,  
I know not how I sink or swim.  
  
Oh love is handsome  
And love is fine,  
The sweetest flower  
When first it's new.  
But love grows old  
And waxes cold  
And fades away like Summer dew.  
  
Build me a boat  
That can carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I,  
And both shall row, my love and I.
