If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
  
Nothing else would matter in the world today  
We could go on loving in the same old way  
A garden of Eden, just made for two  
With nothing to mar our joy  
  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
  
A garden of Eden just made for two  
With nothing to mar our joy  
  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy
