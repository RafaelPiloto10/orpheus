Lady oh lady you're  
Driving me crazy  
You brought out the devil in me  
You turned on my fire  
With words of desire  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
  
You're sending me reeling  
With love that you're giving  
Spinning my poor heart around  
The feelings that should be  
Have finally saved me  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
  
Ain't no use in trying  
I never would deny that  
I love you love you  
Ain't no doubt about it  
I just can't live without it  
I love you love you  
Yes I love you, I really love you  
  
Don't know what it is  
That you're putting down  
I only know it ain't no game  
I only know what you're doing to me  
And baby you're the one to blame  
  
Lady oh lady you're  
Driving me crazy  
You're flying me high  
With your eyes  
There's no use in trying  
Ain't no use denying  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
Yes, you did  
Sure put your lovin'  
Sure put your lovin' on me  
  
Put your lovin', put your lovin' on me
