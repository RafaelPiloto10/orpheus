Everything you are you've been once before  
Everything you hear you've heard it once or more  
Everything you see you've seen it all before  
Everything you dream leads to that open door  
Don't wait so long  
Turn the key before you fade away  
Don't wait so long  
Turn the key before you fade away  
Everyone you love you could have loved them more  
Everyone you touch you could touch to the core  
Every time you wait it's not worth waiting for  
Everyone you lost you better find them all  
Don't wait so long  
Find them all before they fade away  
Don't wait so long  
Find them all before they fade away  
I know you live in isolation  
So you don't have to pretend  
That you could live alone forever  
And be your own best friend  
Here comes the writing on the wall  
And it looks so strange  
Like a primitive sign  
Don't you ever feel that you're so small  
Like a grain of sand in a bottle or wine  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you
