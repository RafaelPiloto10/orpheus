Here's to the morning  
Think that I'm bored and crazy  
Yes I have been to get up when I give in  
I need my second wind and I just can't take it anymore  
I just can't take it when your lying on the floor  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored (ya)  
  
Come entertain ya  
So stupid its contagious  
Mess that I've been  
I get up when you get in  
It makes more sense to win  
  
I just can't fake it anymore  
I just can't it and I heard it all before  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
  
Oh don't be so dramatic  
I know you almost had it  
Whoa  
I tried to show you but you won't go down to her  
  
(get up, get up, get up, now)  
  
Get up off the floor  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored (ya)
