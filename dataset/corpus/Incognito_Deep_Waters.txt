Is it a crime  
For me to be feeling this way  
I'm going out of my mind  
And there's no change from my runaway love  
  
Is it a dream (Is it a dream)  
That I'm throwing in the wishing well  
I'm losin' control  
Body and soul (Body and soul)  
Standin' here waiting for a train that may never come  
  
I saw the signs  
I'd read the book  
I should have had a second look  
But, boy you caught me dreamin'  
And there were times you'd come around  
And we'd agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was foolin' who  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in  
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper  
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in  
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper  
  
What do I say, what can I say  
Where words have failed me before  
What do I do, when I'm feeling so blue  
And there's no place, for me to run and hide  
  
I saw the sun inside your smile  
And wished for more than just a while  
Cause, boy you caught me dreaming  
A giant step into the dark  
We threw caution to the wind  
Tell me who was fooling who  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(I'm drownin')  
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)  
(I'm drownin' in deeper)  
  
Oh, I saw the signs  
I read the book  
I should have had a second look  
'cause, boy you caught me dreamin'  
And there were times you'd come around  
And we'd agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was fooling, fooling who  
  
[Chorus]
