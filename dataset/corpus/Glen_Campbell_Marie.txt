Marie  
You're a strange little one  
Marie  
Always on the run  
Marie  
Where do you belong  
Sometimes you act just like a woman  
Then you're childish as can be  
Now should I treat you like a woman  
Or maybe take you crossed my knee  
Marie  
You're a funny kind of girl  
Marie  
If I only knew your world  
Marie  
Then maybe I could play along  
With you
