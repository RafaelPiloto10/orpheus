They say in chess, you gotta kill the queen  
And then you mate it  
Oh I, do you?  
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated  
Hey now, every time i lose  
Altitude  
  
You took a town by storm  
The mess you made was nominated  
Oh I, do you?  
Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've overstayed it  
Hey now, every time I lose  
Altitude  
  
[Chorus]  
So divine, hell of an elevator  
All the while my fortune faded  
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time  
My fortune faded  
  
The medicated state of mind you find is overrated  
Oh I, do you?  
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it  
Hey now, every time I lose altitude  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on God, do I seem bulletproof?  
Ooooooooooh  
  
[Chorus: x2]
