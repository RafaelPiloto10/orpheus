Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh  
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou  
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou  
  
[Chorus]  
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
  
Thibodeaux, Fontainbleau, the place is buzzin'  
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen  
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Settle down far from town get me pirouge  
And I'll catch all the fish in the bayou  
Swap my mon to buy Yvonne what she needs, oh  
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou.  
  
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
