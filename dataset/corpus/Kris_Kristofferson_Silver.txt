Silver was a rounder with a wicked reputation  
Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one  
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens  
  
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song  
  
Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers  
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land  
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them  
'cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for silver's flashing hands  
  
Then once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows  
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame  
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle  
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses  
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before  
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses  
And silver took it easy as the closing of a door  
  
Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows  
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes  
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows  
Following the line between her laughter and her lies  
  
But silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned  
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms  
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger  
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him  
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes  
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken  
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise  
  
Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation  
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind  
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken  
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find  
  
And silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger  
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day  
And silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder  
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul
