Lucy's a woman who lives just for kicks  
And I guess I'll never change her  
Does what she wants to  
She knows all the tricks  
No  
I'll never rearrange her.  
  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
I'm telling you what you gonna do  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
It's all overforyou.  
Don't you know that it's true  
Because you know I told you once before.  
No messing or you're out that door  
I mean and I meant it thel  
Ain't gonna take you woman back again  
La la la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
It's all over for you  
Don't you know that it's true.  
  
Her time will come when she's out on her own  
Then she won't have me to depend on  
Then she'll find out as she sits all alone  
She's got no one to lean on.  
  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
I'm telling you what you gonna do .
