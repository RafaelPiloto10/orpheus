Daddy used to tell me  
If I ran too fast I'd fall and hurt myself  
But the ice cream man would ring his bell  
And I'd get there before anyone else  
  
I'd see a puppy in the window  
And I'd run and press my face against the pane  
And Daddy'd say slow down girl  
After all these years I guess nothing has changed  
  
[Chorus]  
That little girl I knew  
Ran after you  
But she fell this time  
And broke her heart in two  
Hey that's just like a little girl I knew  
  
Back home there stands an old house  
With a picket fence beneath a big oak tree  
I can almost see the backyard  
And a little girl with freckles  
That was me  
  
And there were dreams of toys and storybooks and  
Lord it seemed I wanted them so bad  
Now 20 years have come and gone  
And I'm still chasing things that I can't have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I'm still that little girl  
  
Daddy I still haven't slowed down yet
