Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin Mother and Child  
Holy Infant, so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace [x2]  
  
Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!  
Christ, the Saviour is born [x2]  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God, love's pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth [x2]
