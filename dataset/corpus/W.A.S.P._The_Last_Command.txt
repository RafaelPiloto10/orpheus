You don't know what's in our hearts  
This is our time, we've made our mark  
And you can't understand, we'll fight till we fall  
But what do you want to do? The time is right for you  
To stand on your feet and answer the call  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command  
  
A thousand times I had this dream, the flag was high, I heard a scream  
That cut through the still of the night just like a knife  
But that was yesterday, the darkness has gone away  
I stand on the edge, and I pledge my life  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command  
  
The destiny that I control will sever  
And break the bonds and set me free forever!  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command
