Well, the clouds didn't look like cotton  
They didn't even look like clouds  
I was underneath the weather  
My friends looked a crowd  
The swimmin' hole was full of rum  
I tried to find out why  
All I learned was this my friend  
You got to swim before you fly  
  
I got two girls  
One's in heaven and one's below  
Oh, one I love with all my heart  
And one I do not know.  
  
Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse  
Passed by not long ago  
They asked me where the action was  
I said I did not know  
As they disappeared into the brush  
I heard the driver say  
He's a little slow between the ears  
He's always been that way.  
  
Jolly Jane just lays around  
And listens with her mouth  
She's had about a dozen husbands  
But the last one pulled out  
Now, who's gonna bring her dinner  
Through the weary years ahead  
All she'll get from me is sympathy  
Got no time to see she's fed.  
  
It's cold down on the bayou  
They say it's in your mind  
But the moccasins are treadin' ice  
And leavin strange designs  
Cajuns say the last time  
That this happend they weren't here  
All Beaumont's full of penguins  
And I'm a-playin' it by ear.
