Saw you standing in the darkness  
With your back against the wall  
And your eyes looked kind of distant  
Then I knew you'd seen it all  
It was then that you betrayed me  
Cause I could see right through your gaze  
I guess you and I have seen much better days  
You used to be so taken  
With the lifestyle of the king  
Now you find love's everything  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well  
You could of been somebody a contender  
I guess that chance just passed you by  
Now you can't remember who to trust  
But I sure wish that you'd try  
And nothing gets you nothing  
And you get back what you give  
You can't hold out much longer  
It's time for you to live  
You used to be so taken  
With the lifestyle of the king  
Now you find love's everything  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well yeah  
You're going to the top  
You're falling up to heaven  
And now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well yeah  
Good things are gonna find you  
Though somebody's got to pay  
You could always turn your back and walk  
But I sure wish that you'd stay  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
You're falling up to heaven  
And your heart ain't gonna stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
And your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
And now you're someone special  
And I still think of you a lot  
And you know I wish you well  
Yeah
