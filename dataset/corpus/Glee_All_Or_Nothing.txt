I can't stay here  
I am not the girl  
Who runs and hides  
Afraid of what could be  
  
And I will go there  
I need time, but know  
That things are always closer  
Than they seem  
  
Now I'll do more than dream yeah!  
  
I'm gonna fly  
Gonna crash right through the sky  
  
Gonna touch the sun  
(Touch the sun)  
Show everyone  
(Show everyone)  
  
That it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
  
This is my life  
I'm not gonna live it twice  
  
There's no in-between  
(No in-between)  
Take it too extreme  
(Too extreme)  
  
Cause it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
  
Or nothing at all...  
  
I can't give up  
Can't just let it burn  
And Watch the fire  
I started turn to dust  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
And now, please don't judge me  
Take my hand and say  
You'll always wish me well  
And send me luck  
  
Cause that would be enough yeah!  
  
I'm gonna fly  
Gonna crash right through the sky  
  
Gonna touch the sun  
(Touch the sun)  
Show everyone  
(Show everyone)  
  
That it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
  
Cause this is my life  
I'm not gonna live it twice  
  
There's no in-between  
(No in-between)  
Take it too extreme  
(Too extreme)  
  
Cause it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
At all  
  
Nothing can stop us now  
(Ooh)  
And there was never a shadow of doubt  
  
That I'm  
Gonna fly  
Gonna crash right through the sky  
  
Gonna touch the sun  
(Touch the sun)  
Show everyone  
(Show everyone)  
  
That it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
  
Cause this is my life  
I'm not gonna live it twice  
  
There's no in-between  
(No in-between)  
Take it too extreme  
(Too extreme)  
  
Cause it's  
All or nothing  
All or nothing  
At all...

(Ooh...)  
Cause it's all or nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all!  
(Yeah)

At all  
  
All or nothing
