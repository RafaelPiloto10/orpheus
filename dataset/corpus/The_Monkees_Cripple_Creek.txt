Well I married a wife in the month of June,  
Married her up by the light of the moon.  
We live down on Cripple Creek.  
We've been there about a week.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a-goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
  
Now Cripple Creek girl's about half-grown,  
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone.  
Roll my pants up to my knees,  
Cross on Cripple Creek a-when I please.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run,  
Goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.
