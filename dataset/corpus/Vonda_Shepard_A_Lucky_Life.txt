We've live a long, long time and all the radios are playing our song tonight  
We walk a crooked line 'cause there is a counter life in your jailed eyes  
You're never a victim of your generation and you shine on me like a holy light  
All of the miracles and conversations rain on me tonight  
  
We've got a one track mind, true as a railroad, always on time  
I see it in your eyes, you don't have to talk to me, I know what you're
thinking  
I need my solitude as much as you do darling, to live this life we came here
for  
Never for one single solitary moment did I need you more  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it all tonight  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life  
  
My home is on the road, the pavement caters to, to my gypsy soul  
We walk the tightest rope, we live in a circus, circus of hope  
All of the melodies and inspirations shine on me like a holy light  
Right in the middle of our conversations you wink at me, saying it's alright  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it in your eyes  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life
