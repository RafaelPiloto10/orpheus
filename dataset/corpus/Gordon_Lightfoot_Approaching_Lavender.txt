If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure  
You'll never be the same  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender  
You'll soon be on a one night tour  
Forgetting your own name  
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender  
For the light so warm and pure  
Will draw you like a flame  
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Like flowers in the rain  
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender  
With words you never spoke before  
And will not speak again  
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly  
There is no way that I can see  
You living by yourself  
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly  
Your presence means so much to me  
Much more that life itself  
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear  
Please cast away the clothes you wear  
And give your love to me  
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun  
I'd love to see you laugh and run  
As naked as the sea  
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
Don't try and get the best of her  
She will not share the blame  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
There is no shame
