Took my hand  
Touched my heart  
Held me close  
You were always there  
  
By my side  
Night and day  
Through it all  
Maybe come what may  
  
Swept away on a wave of emotion  
Over-caught in the eye of the storm  
And whenever you smile  
I can hardly believe that you're mine  
Believe that you're mine  
  
This love is  
It's unmistakable  
And each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time I look in your eyes  
Oh baby, I know why  
This love is unbreakable  
  
Shared the laughter  
Shared the tears  
We both know  
We'll go on from here  
  
'Cause together we are strong  
In my arms  
That's where you belong  
  
I've been touched by the hands of an angel  
I've been blessed by the power of love  
And whenever you smile  
I can hardly believe that you're mine  
  
This love is unbreakable  
It's unmistakable  
Each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time you whisper my name  
Oh baby, I know why  
  
This love is unbreakable  
Through fire and flame  
When all this over  
Our love still remains  
  
This love is unbreakable  
It's unmistakable  
And each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time you whisper my name  
Oh baby, I know why  
Cause each time I look in your eyes  
Oh baby, I know why  
  
This love is unbreakable
