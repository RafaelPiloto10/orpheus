I'm lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know you hurt too but what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart  
For times when my life seems so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesn't really know.  
  
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it, too  
Does the feeling seem, oh, so right  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I just can't hold on  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please, love me or I'll be gone  
  
'Cause I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
And though you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong, so wrong  
  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
I'm thinking about you're gone  
What are you thinking of?  
How do we go so wrong?  
  
Ooh, I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
It can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
Oh, here I'm all out of love,  
Nothing without you  
And I know it was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
