I was born a believer, played the fool  
Lonely dreamer, left to choose  
I don't know where the love is, there's a promise undone  
Someone's cryin, in a room all alone  
Shadows fall, after the hurt is gone  
Through it all, we love and we lose  
  
Where is the one, someone who's happy (happy to give)  
Happy to be with you, it's here you belong, with someone  
Who's happy (happy to give) happy to give you love  
  
A song for the singer, one book of dreams  
Take this heartache, away from me  
A page in a story, romance untold  
Sharing secrets, we call, our own  
Shadows fall, after the hurt is gone  
Through it all, we love and we lose  
  
Where is the one, someone who's happy (happy to give)  
Happy to be with you, it's where you belong, with someone  
Who's happy (happy to give) happy to give you love  
  
Happy, happy, oh happy  
(Happy to give), ooo happy to give  
Oh somebody's happy to give you love,  
Your love, your love oh yeah
