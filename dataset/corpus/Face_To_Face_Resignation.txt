You can't be right  
You're full of prejudice and spite  
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong  
Out of my way  
There is a consequence to pay  
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong  
  
I am someone who'll burn the whole world down  
I'm the one to bring it right around  
  
You're giving up on me  
But what else have you got  
  
You're losing sight  
I won't give up without a fight  
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong  
I'm not afraid  
I'll take the chance I have to take  
You think you've got me pegged but you're wrong  
  
You can't expect the world to bend to you  
You only feed the fire of anger and our disbelief  
  
I can't be everything to everyone  
And I can't be everything you think that I should be
