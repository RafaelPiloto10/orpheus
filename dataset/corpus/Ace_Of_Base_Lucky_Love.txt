Life is a paradise...whoa oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven  
I know, I know  
'Cause I've been there with you tonight  
  
I believe life could be paradise once again...  
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within  
Close your eyes it's something for you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I'm a prisoner of hope  
I know  
  
We are young and we are old  
We're fallin' like leaves, like leaves...  
And your heart's so full of soul  
It makes me believe  
Once again, it's something for you...  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
A bridge over time  
Was what you need to see the light, to see the light  
Oh yeah  
Lucky love, lucky love  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven...  
  
[Chorus x2]
