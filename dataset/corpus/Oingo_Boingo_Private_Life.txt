This is my private life  
I have no friends to fear  
I've got no problems no cross to bear  
If you can find me  
Come and get me out of here  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
  
These are my private things  
There they are against the wall  
The dirty pictures, religious objects  
These are my private things  
Come and get them out of here  
  
This is my private bed  
This is where I lie at night  
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling  
Waiting for a dream to  
Come and get me out of here  
  
Here in my humble room at night  
I often wonder what goes on out there  
What makes them runs o scared  
I often stare at the people passing by  
But they can't see me through my window shades  
Just like I'm not even there  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
There's something dangerous I like  
  
This is my private life  
I know my problems aren't your fault  
What I really want to know  
Has it always been this way  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
Come and get me out of here
