PORTOFINO  
WRITERS MARK SPIRO, JACK WHITE  
  
Long ago I used to know where love was found, A place in the sun  
Long before this heart of mine had broken down You were the one  
But now you're a lonely memory My heartache will never end  
Though all of those nights are far away I wish I were with you again.
Portofino I still remember the sun in your hair  
Portofino mariachi music that danced in the air  
Portofino I want you back in my arms  
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm holding you in the dark  
In Portofino where you broke my heart.  
I think of your face and still it can take my breath away After so long  
And though I'll be lonely living for only yesterday I'll get along  
Though now you're a faded memory My heartache will never end  
This unforgotten melody keeps playing over and over again  
Portofino I still remember the sun in your hair  
Portofino mariachi music that danced in the air  
Portofino I want you back in my arms  
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm holding you in the dark  
In Portofino where you broke my heart  
In Portofino where you broke my heart.
