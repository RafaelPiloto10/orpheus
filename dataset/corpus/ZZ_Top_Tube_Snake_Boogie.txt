I got a girl she lives cross town,  
She's the one that really gets down.  
When she boogie,  
She do the tube snake boogie.  
Well now boogie little baby,  
Boogie woogie all night long.  
  
I got a girl she lives on the block,  
She kinda funky with her pink and black socks.  
She likes to boogie,  
She do the tube snake boogie.  
Well now boogie woogie baby,  
Boogie woogie all night long.  
  
I got a girl, she lives on the hill.  
She won't do it but her sister will,  
When she boogie,  
She do the tube snake boogie.  
Well now boogie little baby,  
Boogie woogie all night long.  
Blow your top blow your top blow your top.
