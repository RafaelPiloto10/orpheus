It wasn't very long ago.  
I met you,I saw you.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
You whispered "I love you"  
  
Look at us now.  
Crying our hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like, although...  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I thrilled when I kissed you.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I cried when I missed you  
  
Look at us now.  
Crying at hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like  
Although It wasn't very long ago.  
  
Look look my eyes aren't shining with love  
And they won't.  
Look I'm not crying 'cause I need you,  
I'm crying 'cause I don't, oh  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I held you, so closely.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I dreamed of,you mostly  
  
Look us now.  
Crying at hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like.  
Although it wasn't very long ago.  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
Not so very long ago..
