True love is gone, I's been played for a fool  
True love is gone, I's been played for a fool  
I'm turnin' the tables on you  
You've been playin' dirty pool  
  
You said you'd call the shots darlin',  
All your friends thought that was cool, so cool baby  
You said you'd call the shots darlin',  
All your friends thought that was so cool  
  
Yeah when you shot at the eight-ball baby,  
I knew you were playin' dirty pool  
  
They say that life, life is a game of give and take  
They say that life, life is a game of give and take  
I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby  
I won't be the one to pay for your mistake
