Well, I've heard of heart breakers  
But you take the cake  
Ladies' man  
You could charm the diamonds  
Off a rattlesnake  
Ladies' man  
Ladies bring it on over  
When you give 'em the glance  
They don't stand a chance  
First, you unfold them  
Then you pigeon-hole 'em  
Ladies' man  
  
Well it sure takes a lot of  
Good natured self-control  
Ladies' man  
When I'm so hot for you and  
You're so cold, so cold  
Ladies' man  
Why do you keep on trying to  
Make a man of me  
Couldn't you just love me  
Like you love cocaine  
Cocaine head games  
  
Cross my heart I swear  
I'm not trying to trick you  
No tricks  
Ladies' man  
It's just a straight ahead feeling  
I have for you  
Nothing slick  
Ladies' man  
I guess you learn to refuse  
What you think you can't handle  
You're acting like a vandal  
Wrecking the dream  
At the first bad scene  
Ladies' man  
Ladies' man  
Ladies' man  
Ladies' man
