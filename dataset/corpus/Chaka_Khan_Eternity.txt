Seems like an eternity since I've been in your arms  
A multitude of colorless hours pass  
I crave the life inside you, it keeps me from harm  
I only pray that it's not just another God  
  
Eternity, I want to be with you for all eternity  
Darling you be, the only one for me together for eternity  
  
I long to touch you (I long yo touch you)  
To feel the warmth in a world so cold  
Whenever we (ooh) -- I don't know  
But I want you all the time (I want to hold on)  
you are the beginning middle and end to every story told  
you are the science of my mind  
  
Eternity, I want to be with you for all eternity  
Darling you be, the only one for me together for eternity  
  
And it seems like a year away  
That you and I were making love  
One should take life from day to day  
But all my dreams are made of  
All my dreams are made of eternity
