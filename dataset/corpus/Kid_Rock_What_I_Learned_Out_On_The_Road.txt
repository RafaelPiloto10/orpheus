Headin' for the south lands  
Lookin' for some fun  
Down below that dixie mason  
I know your the one  
  
My tongue is chasin' my eyes are wide  
I can see paradise  
I been down here once or twice  
But I never seen it look so nice  
  
Ahh yeah  
Ahh yeah yeah  
I like it with the grass cut low  
Big mountain tops valley below  
I love it when you scream out my name  
  
Kid Rock, what you say?  
Kid Rock, what you say?  
Kid Rock, what you say?

'Cause I'm a bad mama jamma from Detroit city  
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city  
I'm raw and greedy, show me, gimme, I'll nick it  
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it  
  
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie  
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body  
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man  
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
You know I've tried a thousand times and I've tried to explain  
And I've cried a thousand times over things that I can't change  
I've learned a lot you know, I grow each passing day  
And I blame nobody but myself for mistakes that I have made  
  
He's a bad maama jamma from Detroit city  
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city  
I'm raw and greedy, show me gimme, I'll nick it  
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it  
  
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie  
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body  
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man  
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
Lord knows when your not here, I get so damn bored of me  
And I've spent some lonely nights that did not have to be  
And if you could only see, I swear I'd show you true  
And although I carry a load out on the road,  
I want to come back home to you  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
From Detroit to Carolina  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
From London town down to China  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road
