Try it, try it, try my love  
Why won't you try it, try it, try my love?  
I think of you each day, I think of you at night  
Do you think about me, darling  
When you make love to your wife?  
The world won't understand, my affair with a married man  
(Try it, try it, try my love)  
Try my love

Do you think of us on weekends when you're with your family  
Are you lonely when you're with her  
And do you ever long for me?  
As I get down on my knees as I cry myself to sleep  
(Try it, try it, try my love)  
Try my love  
I'm in love with a married man  
(Why won't you try it, try it, try my love?)
