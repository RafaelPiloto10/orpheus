You belong  
To somebody else and not to me  
Right or wrong  
That's not the way that it's going to be  
I want you so much inside  
I'm throwing away all my conscience and pride, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
And I'll try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
  
I've been burned  
Whenever I've followed all the rules  
So I've learned  
That playing it fair is just for fools  
I'm fighting and win or lose  
I'm not minding my P's and Q's, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
Try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
My man, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
I want you so much inside  
I'm throwing away all my conscience and pride, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
Try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
Going to make you my man, yeah  
Make you my man  
Going to fight 'til I die  
Going to cheat and lie
