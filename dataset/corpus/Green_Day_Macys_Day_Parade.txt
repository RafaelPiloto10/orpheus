Today's the Macy's Day parade  
The night of the living dead is on its way  
With a credit report for duty call  
It's a lifetime guarantee  
Stuffed in a coffin ten percent more free  
Red-light special at the mausoleum  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed to you  
What's the consolation prize?  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
  
When I was a kid I thought  
I wanted all the things that I haven't got  
Oh, I learned the hardest way  
Then I realized what it took  
To tell the difference between  
Thieves and crooks  
Lesson learned to me and you  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
Cause now I know  
It's all that I wanted  
  
What's the consolation prize?  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
And where it goes  
And I'm thinking about  
The only road  
The one I've never known  
And where it goes  
  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
Cause now I know  
It's all that I wanted
