I spend my days just mooning, so sad and blue, so sad and blue  
I spend my nights just mooning, all over you (all over who?)  
  
Oh I'm so full of love, as any fool can see  
Cause ages up above, have hung the moon on me  
  
(Why must you go) why must I go on mooning, so all alone (so all alone)  
There would be no (there would be no) more mooning, if you would call me  
(Up on the phone)  
I guess I'll keep on striking poses, till my cheeks have lost their roses.  
Mooning over you,  
  
I'll stand behind (you'll stand behind) you mooning, forever more. (For
evermore)  
Someday you'll find (someday we'll find) me mooning at your front door  
(At my front door)  
  
Oh, everyday at school I watch ya, always will until I gotcha  
Mooning, too (there's a moon up tonight)
