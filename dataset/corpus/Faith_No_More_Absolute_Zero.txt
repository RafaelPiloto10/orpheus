  
ABSOLUTE ZERO  
Can we begin at the end?  
To Save Some time  
Bags and our War Planes are Gathered  
The Clock is ticking you have no authority  
Float like a dead man down the river  
And there are no streets in this air.....  
Etcetera is my worst enemy  
Its wrong and I know  
And I will go  
To the Big Hand of the God Damned  
The Middle Ground is Absolute Zero  
What Can be found at Absolute Zero?  
Can We Begin at the end?  
To Save some time  
Etcetera is my worst enemy  
Its wrong and I know  
And I will go  
To the big hand of the God Damned  
The Big Hand of the Small Man  
The Middle Gorund is Absolute Zero  
What can be found at Absolute Zero?  
A Happy End is Absolute Zero  
Nobody Wins at absolute Zero......  
What's That?  
Nothing  
What's That?  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Nothing
