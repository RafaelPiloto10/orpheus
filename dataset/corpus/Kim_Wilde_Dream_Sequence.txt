Shadows across the floor  
Memories fading in  
Voices are far away  
Now it can all begin  
  
"New York are on the 'phone  
They want you here today"  
"Was it a fashion show ?"  
"Sorry they wouldn't say"  
  
There's a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
There's a world no-one knows  
Wrapped up in her mind  
(It's all imagination)  
  
Now she is back in school  
(It's the revolution)  
Staring at broken glass  
(Do what we want you to)  
Flicking the flies away  
(Total autonomy)  
Watching the trains go past  
  
Fighting the Indian war  
Cochise is closing in  
Now she can touch his face !  
Riding so close to him  
  
There's a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
There's a world no-one's seen  
Living in her mind  
  
Sailing across a sea  
Images on a screen  
Watching the boats go by  
Red merging into green  
  
Roxanne don't run away  
(You've been naughty girl)  
I told you not to go  
(Stay in the garden)  
Why do you run away ?  
Mommy will sorry so
