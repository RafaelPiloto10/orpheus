Spend you days just walking and shopping  
Depending on how much you're luck is in  
Spend the night-life table-hopping  
And trying to keep that bag of bones in trim  
  
I don't mind not being immortal  
Cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell  
I don't mind not going to heaven  
As long as they've got cigarettes  
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell  
  
And by the time we start getting used to it  
The dope that's forming on the windowsill  
Now we know we've got ourselves into  
The cage that keeps the mice on the treadmill  
  
I don't mind not being immortal  
Cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell  
I don't mind not going to heaven  
As long as they've got cigarettes  
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell  
  
I don't mind not being immortal  
Because it ain't all that as far as I can tell  
I don't mind not going to heaven  
As long as they've got cigarettes  
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell
