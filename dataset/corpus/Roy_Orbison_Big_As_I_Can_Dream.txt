I know they don't think that I'll amount to much  
But your love has given me the magic touch  
Just put your faith in me and strange as it may seem  
I will build a dream for you  
Big as I can dream  
  
I know that they want the best things for you  
That is just what I have planned  
If they only knew  
  
There's no mountain that's too high  
I can ford any stream  
For your love I can be  
Big as I can dream  
  
There's no mountain that's too high  
I can ford any stream  
For your love I can be  
Big as I can dream  
Big as I can dream  
Big as I can dream
