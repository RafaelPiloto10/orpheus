Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move.  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Pack my bag and let's get moving  
'Cause I'm bound to drift awhile.  
Though I'm gone, gone  
You don't have to worry  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Guess I've got that old travelin' bone  
'Cause this feeling won't leave alone.  
But I won't, won't  
Be losin' my way  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light.
