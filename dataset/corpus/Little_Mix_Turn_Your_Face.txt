In my memory, all the small things, like daggers in my mind  
In my memory, while my head bleeds, the words I'll never find  
That I always meant to say to you I can't  
  
Cause you turned your face, and now I can't feel you anymore  
Turn your face, so now I can't see you anymore  
Walk away until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face, hmm oh  
  
In my memory, I was hurting, long before we met, oh  
In my memory, there's still burning, fingerprints you left  
And I'll always meant to say to you I can't  
  
So just turn your face, until I can't see you anymore  
Turn your face, until I can't see you anymore  
Walk away until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face  
  
Each time I take you back  
You bring one thousand cracks  
And I accept them, like a fool oh  
  
So now what's your excuse  
What do we have to lose  
Since I'm already losing you  
  
So hard to face, that I can't feel you anymore  
Hard to face, that I can't see you anymore  
So walk away, until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away, and stay  
  
Turn your face  
Turn your face, and stay  
Turn your face
