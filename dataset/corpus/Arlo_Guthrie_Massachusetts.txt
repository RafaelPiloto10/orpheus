Like a dream in the night  
As the snow settles white  
There's a fire burning bright  
In Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
The sun comes up to meet the dawn  
And there's a day that must go on  
There's another night that's gone  
In Massachusetts  
And I could spend all of my days  
And remain each day amazed  
At the way each day is phrased  
In Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
Now if you could only see  
I know you would agree  
There ain't nowhere else to be  
Like Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
Come on tell me about the time you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
And please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same as Massachusetts
