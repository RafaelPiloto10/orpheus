Julianna, be mine tonight  
The time has come girl and the feelings right  
Love forever, not fade away  
A reborn love of yesterday.  
  
I can't believe it, this love I've found  
The fever's rising I can't cool it down  
And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just won't end.  
  
Ooo, yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
I've got a burning love, Girl, and you feel the same  
See the embers, feel the flame.  
  
I can't believe in this love I've found  
The fever's rising, I can't cool it down  
And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just won't end.  
  
Ooo, yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
I've got a burning love, Girl, and you feel the same  
See the embers, feel the flame  
See the embers, feel the flame.  
  
Ooo yeah all right...
