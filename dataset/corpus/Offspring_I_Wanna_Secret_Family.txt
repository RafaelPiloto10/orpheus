Every girl's a story, call it morning glory  
She wakes it up and pony, whoa  
Dancing on the table, everybody's...  
Holding up his dollars, pointing as he hollers  
  
It's you, waiting out for you baby  
I want a secret family with you  
Waiting out for you baby  
  
It's too big too... Gotta get my swag on  
Looking for an adult  
Standing in the mirror,  
Tryna get you nearer  
Funking is the meaner  
This is what he said  
He said, I've been a lonely man, du du du du du du du  
Such a lonely man, du du du du du du du  
He said, I've been a lonely man, du du du du du du du  
Such a lonely man, du du du du du du du  
  
It's you, waiting out for you baby  
I want a secret family with you  
Waiting out for you baby  
  
For you with your drama thing...  
And it's making me fall  
  
It's you, waiting out for you baby  
I want a secret family with you  
And it's alright  
  
I've been a lonely man  
Such a lonely man  
I've been a lonely man  
Such a lonely man  
  
Now I've got you, waiting out for you baby  
I want a secret family with you  
Waiting out for you baby  
  
First we went to... With the south I'm blown away  
... And it's bigger than...  
It's you, waiting out for you baby  
I want a secret family with you  
Start a secret family with you  
And it's alright, yeah it's alright.
