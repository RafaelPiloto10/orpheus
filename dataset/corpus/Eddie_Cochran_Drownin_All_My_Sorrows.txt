You ask me if I'm lonesome, you say you're feelin' blue  
Go get lost little baby doll, I don't wanna mess with you  
I'm drownin' all my sorrows, I wanna be left alone  
For the one I love has left me  
She won't even answer the phone  
You ask me why I'm cryin', you just don't understand  
The one I thought was mine alone has found her another man  
I'm drownin' all my sorrows, the lights are gettin' kinda dim  
She left me for another, I bet she'll do the same thing to him  
  
I'll never trust a woman, they never can be true  
They take your money, break your heart  
And leave you feelin' blue  
I'm drownin' all my sorrows, I guess a guy like me can't win  
I don't know where I'm goin', I don't even know where I been  
Well my poor head is achin', I just can't seem to think  
Pour me out a double please and pour this little gal a drink  
I've drowned all my sorrows and now I'm gonna have a plain  
I'm glad my baby left me, to me she never meant a thing
