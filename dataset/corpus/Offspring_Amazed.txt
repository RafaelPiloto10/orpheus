Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown  
'Cause everyone around's so hollow  
I'm alone  
Sometimes I think I'm going down  
  
But no one makes a sound  
They follow  
And I'm alone  
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed  
  
Just to find tomorrow  
One more day and I'd be amazed  
Just to see it waiting  
And if I make it I'm still alone  
  
No more hope for better days  
But if I could change  
Then I'd really be amazed  
And when you know you can't relate  
  
To one more shiny face  
Your heart breaks  
No one cares  
And when you know you can't go on  
  
'Cause everything is wrong  
Your heart breaks  
But no one's there
