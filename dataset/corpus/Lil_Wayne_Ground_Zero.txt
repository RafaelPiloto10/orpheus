Back the hell off  
Rock 'n' roll Jesus with all my nails on  
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond  
And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on  
Rollin' like a motherfucker put your wheels on  
And lets roll down and heal till the heal gone  
I started on the block but that something to build on  
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on  
  
Hey  
The ground is gone  
Don't look now but the ground is gone  
I'm so high that the ground is gone  
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on  
Don't look down but the ground is gone  
Don't look down cause the ground is gone  
Right now I'm a million miles from home  
And I'm so high that the ground is gone  
  
Walk on air,  
show me to the edge and I walk off there  
We ain't high enuff O'contraire,  
and sometimes life just don't compare  
Say my name baby pull my hair,  
and I'm a fuck you like a bull I swear  
I gotta lot of love that I could just share  
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share!  
I know I know where should I go,  
a nice lil' mirror and a little white girl  
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing.  
May I be everything but grounded!  
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad.  
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float

I know a girl named Crystal her last name Ball  
I look into her eyes and I can see it all  
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call  
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall  
  
Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war  
Thinkin' would a mind be in spiritual for  
Huh shit, cause ain't no love  
die while America drink your blood  
It ain't no hurricane it ain't no flood  
This some other shit we aint no of  
Make that money yeah make that money!  
Then watch the goverment take that money  
But we gon' raise hell, motherfucker get well  
Laws get passed and economies fail  
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion, addiction, fiction,virgins  
Dixons, means, mixing, swinging, switching, swagging,  
Sweets, freaks, faggots, flame, fashion, planes crashing  
ground zero
