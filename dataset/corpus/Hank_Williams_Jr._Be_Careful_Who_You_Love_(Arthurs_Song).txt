The old guitar picker had run out of liquor  
So I sat down beside him and bought him a drink  
I bought him another and finally some color  
Returned to his cheeks, and he said with a wink  
Son, I worked for Red Foley, knew Hank and Old Lefty  
I worked on the Opry back when I was strong  
But in showbiz you know sometimes it gets slow  
So you buy us another and I'll sing you a song  
Be careful who you love, for love can be untrue  
Be careful who you love, be sure she loves you too
