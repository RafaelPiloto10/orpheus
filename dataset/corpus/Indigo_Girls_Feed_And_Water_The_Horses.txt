Tell me dark heart of my deep sleep  
Where the past drops in like unwanted guests  
Rattling their chains of thought, shuffling their feet  
Peering into things I thought I'd laid to rest  
And for all I've left undone there's another dream to come  
  
Once there were wars fought over spice and salt  
And the stick of gold became the standard measure  
Nothing much has changed in this modern age  
And it won't until the pain's not worth the pleasure  
  
And for all we've left undone  
There's another war to come.  
  
I want to feed and water the horses,  
The course is long and dry  
Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you, we'll come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses  
Where they lie.  
  
I miss the smell of ink on paper and it's morning pull  
All the news comes via link now all so virtual  
I don't know what to think  
I don't know what to feel  
The beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel  
  
And for all we've left undone  
We are still evolution  
  
I want to feed and water the horses,  
The course is long and dry  
Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you, we'll come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses  
Where they lie.  
  
I realize that the beast lie there in our plans  
Peacefully sleeping, but faithfully keeping  
They're ready for the burden man  
  
But if you knew something (peacefully sleeping)  
They'd take you to something (faithfully keeping)  
You are dying for your burden man (they're ready for the burden man)  
  
Wouldn't you need it? (Wouldn't you need it?)  
Wouldn't you feed it? (Wouldn't you feed it?)  
Wouldn't you praise it evermore?  
  
Feed and water the horses  
The course is long and dry  
Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you. We'll come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses where they lie.
