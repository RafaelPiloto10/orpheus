Oh please, don't talk about me when I'm gone  
Although our friendship ceases from now on  
  
Hey carmen, if you can't say anything real nice  
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice  
  
We are parting  
You go your way  
I'll go mine  
It's best that we do  
Here's a little kiss  
I hope that this brings lots of love to you  
  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
'cause baby I know you'd better not talk about me when I'm gone
