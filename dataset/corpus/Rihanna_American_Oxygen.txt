[Chorus]  
Breathe out, breathe in  
American oxygen  
Every breath I breathe  
Chasin' this American Dream  
We sweat for a nickel and a dime  
Turn it into an empire  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American oxygen  
  
[Refrain]  
American oxygen  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American Oxygen  
  
[Verse 1]  
Oh say can you see, this is the American Dream  
Young girl, hustlin'  
On the other side of the ocean  
You can be anything at all  
In America, America  
I say, can't see  
Just close your eyes and breathe  
  
[Chorus]  
Breathe out, breathe in  
American oxygen  
Every breath I breathe  
Chasin' this American Dream  
We sweat for a nickel and a dime  
Turn it into an empire  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American oxygen  
  
[Refrain x2]  
American oxygen  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American Oxygen  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh say, you see, this is the American Dream  
Young boy, hustlin'  
Tryna get the wheels in motion  
But he can be anything at all  
In America, America  
I say, can't see  
Just close your eyes and breathe  
  
[Chorus]  
Breathe out, breathe in  
American oxygen  
Every breath I breathe  
Chasin' this American Dream  
We sweat for a nickel and a dime  
Turn it into an empire  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American oxygen  
  
[Bridge x4]  
This is the new America  
We are the new America  
  
[Chorus]  
Breathe out, breathe in  
American oxygen  
Every breath I breathe  
Chasin' this American Dream  
We sweat for a nickel and a dime  
Turn it into an empire  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American oxygen  
  
[Refrain x2]  
American oxygen  
Breathe in, this feeling  
American, American Oxygen  
  
[Bridge x2]  
This is the new America  
We are the new America
