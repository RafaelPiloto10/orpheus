I'm the most dangerous person in this room  
The way you look  
I could do some damage to myself  
It's your heart against mine  
And I fear I may capsize  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
'Cause you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
You turn your face  
The two sides don't synchronize  
You're nothing like anyone I've ever seen before  
If I'm staring at you then I apologize  
You defy every rule I've learned  
But still I've never been half so turned on  
And you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
Handsome's not a word that comes to mind  
But I'd have to be blind to try and minimize  
How easy you are on the eyes  
Easy on the eyes  
In my vertigo  
You're easy on the eyes  
From head to toe  
You're so easy on the eyes  
  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
And you're just so easy  
You're just so damn easy on the eyes
