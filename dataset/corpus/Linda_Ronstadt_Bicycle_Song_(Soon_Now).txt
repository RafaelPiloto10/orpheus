Soon now  
I'm gonna tell the people in the streets  
And set 'em dancin'  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
Soon now I'm gonna write a letter home  
And tell my mother  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
  
I'm in love with you  
And the world is new  
It feels so good to be alive  
I'm in love I can't keep the news inside  
Soon now I'm gonna go walkin' through the trees  
And talkin' to the flowers  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
  
All of my life I was lonely  
Nobody cared  
Nobody loved me  
Now that you're here  
I'm always happy happy happy  
Soon now I'm gonna tell all of my friends  
And they'll go party  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I mean the whole world  
I mean the whole world  
I'm in love
