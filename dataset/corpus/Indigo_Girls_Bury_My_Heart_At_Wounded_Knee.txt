Indian legislation's on the desk of a do right congressman  
And he don't know much about the issues so he picks up the phone  
And asks the advice of the senator out in Indian country  
A darling of the energy companies ripping off  
What's left of the reservation  
  
I learned the safety rule  
I don't know who to thank  
Don't stand between the reservation  
And the corporate bank  
They're sending federal tanks  
It isn't nice but it's reality  
  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
I said deep in the earth  
Won't you cover me with pretty lies  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
  
We got these energy companies  
Who want to take the land  
And we got churches by the dozens  
Trying to guide our hands  
And turn our mother earth  
Over to pollution war and greed  
No no  
  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
I said deep in the earth  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Won't you cover me with pretty lies  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
  
We got the federal marshals  
We got the covert spies  
We got the liars by fire  
And the FBI  
They lie in court and get nailed  
And still Leonard Peltier goes off to jail  
(the bullets don't match the gun)  
  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
An eighth of the reservation  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Was transferred in secret  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
We got your murder and intimidation  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
  
My girlfriend anna may  
Talked about uranium  
Her head was full of bullets  
And her body dumped  
The FBI cut off her hands  
And told us she died of exposure  
  
To bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
I said deep in the earth  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Won't you cover me with your pretty lies  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Talk about a revolution  
They stole my land  
They won't steal my soul  
  
We had the gold rush wars  
Why didn't we learn to crawl'  
And now our history gets written in a liar's scrawl  
They tell me "don't be so uptight  
I mean honey you can still be an Indian  
Down at the y on saturday night''  
  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
I said deep in the earth  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Won't you cover me with your pretty lies  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
Bury my heart at wounded knee  
  
Bury my heart  
It was an eighth of the reservation  
Bury my heart  
Yeah was transferred in secret  
Bury my heart  
Got your murder, murder, murder and intimidation  
Bury me  
Bury me  
Bury me  
Bury my heart  
Bury my heart  
Bury my heart  
Bury my heart
