Who cheers you up  
When you are down  
Who brings you cups of coffee  
Who picks you up  
When you're in town  
Whatever makes you happy  
And I'm glad you're better now  
But I'm sad you're not around  
Friends  
Won't ever desert you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Won't love you and leave you  
To mend the fence  
Who wakes you up  
When you're late for work  
Who makes the bed so lovely  
Who found your sock  
Who pressed your shirt  
Whatever makes you love me  
And I'm glad I'm better now  
But I'm just sad you're not around  
Friends  
Will never deceive you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Won't love you and leave you  
To mend the fence...
