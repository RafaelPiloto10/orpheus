[Chorus]  
How strong is my love?  
How strong is my love?  
How strong is my love?  
How wrong could it be?  
  
I'll walk a water mile  
Rest a while to kiss your smile  
Laugh and roll and after a while  
I'll begin to like your style  
  
How strong is my love?  
How wrong could it be?  
She turned me down this time  
She turned me down  
  
Lord, I can't believe she  
She turned me down  
She turned me inside out  
She turned me down  
  
All I ask of you  
Is turn me up this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on over show me your  
Your glow soul I do adore  
I'll be sure to drop my guard  
Give it up it's not that hard  
  
Lord, I can't believe she  
She turned me down  
She turned me inside out  
She turned me down  
  
All I ask of you  
Is turn me up this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tested life but that's alright  
Darker than the darkest night  
Living hell and pollocks at you  
Getting new down your back  
  
How strong is my love?  
How wrong could it be?
