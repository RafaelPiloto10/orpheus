I was born on the banks of eternity  
A page of the history it teaches  
Not a care, lived my life like a hurricane  
Leaving everything along the way in pieces  
  
Some may have cheered, some may have wondered  
If I am flesh, if I am stone  
Thoughts of you tear through me like thunder  
You are the light that has led me back home  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
A southern boy has it harder sometimes  
It's like you were climbing a razor  
You were there when my dreams had all turned to dust  
And the man in the mirror was a stranger  
  
Look at me now, a soulless survivor  
No mask can hide the man that I've made  
You ease my pain  
Your make it silent  
Slowly I feel it beginning to fade  
  
I want to feel it  
Rushing over me into the tide  
I want to taste it  
Every moment 'til the end of my life  
  
I have laid still, adrift in you memory  
Hoping your faith would erase all the years  
Maybe some time, maybe some magic  
Maybe your love will make everything clear  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
There are no expectations hiding in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
And let me bury this disguise
