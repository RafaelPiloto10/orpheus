I remember everything  
I've learned about survival  
I've walked with fools and kings  
And I've even read the bible  
There I came upon some lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
Your kingdom is in heaven  
But I chose to live instead  
Inside the shell they gave me  
'til in spite of everything  
Good fortune came to find me  
I tried my best to run away  
But I could not avoid the feelin'  
Soon I was reelin' on my feet  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone and let myself surrender  
I didn't want to die at all  
I thought I'd live forever  
Then she gave me everything  
A king could never borrow  
But I twisted all her gifts  
Her wisdom was my sorrow  
So I left her cryin'  
And roamed across the river  
The angels offered me their hands  
But I could not forget her  
So I came to where she was  
By river, road and reason  
I slept beneath her window  
In the moonlight summer season  
But I could not go inside  
I heard the sound of laughter  
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow  
I didn't want to live no more  
Nor face the bright tomorrow  
Then I remembered everything  
I've learned about survival  
Havin' walked with fools and kings  
I've even read the bible  
I remember all those lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
It will not pass inspection  
And still I think when I'm alone  
Away from all night splendor  
If gold could buy one night with her  
I wish I had some to send her
