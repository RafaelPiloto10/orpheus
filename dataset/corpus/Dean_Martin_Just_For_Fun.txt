Love me love me say you love me  
Just for fun  
Softly sigh it try it try it  
Just for fun  
If you're close to me maybe you'll agree  
Here at hand that magic land we're seeking constantly  
Tingle tingle when we mingle  
Just for fun  
Let's pretend we'll never end  
What we've begun  
For if we play at love we may stay in love  
Then you'll be glad you tried it just for fun  
Tingle tingle when we mingle  
Just for fun  
Let's pretend we'll never end  
What we've begun  
For if we play at love we may stay in love  
Then you'll be glad you tried it just for fun
