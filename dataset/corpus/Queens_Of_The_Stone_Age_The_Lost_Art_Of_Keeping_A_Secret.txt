Well I've got a secret, I cannot say  
Blame all the movement to give it away  
You've got somethin', I understand  
Holding it tightly, caught on command  
Leap of faith, do you doubt?  
Cut you in, I just cut you out  
  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
  
Look for reflections, in your face  
Canine devotion, time can't erase  
Out on the corner, locked in your room  
I never believe them and I never assume  
Still can't believe there is a lie  
Promises promise, an eye for an eye  
We've got something to reveal  
No one can know how we feel  
  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell  
  
I think you already know  
How far I'd go not to say  
You know the art is gone  
And I'm taking this all to the grave  
  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell anyone  
Whatever you do  
Don't tell
