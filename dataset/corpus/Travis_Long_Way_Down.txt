It's a long way down  
Above the two tone town  
And it's no funny when you're stuck in the middle  
I'm coming up for air  
I could be anywhere  
It makes no difference when you live in a puddle  
Now that I see it  
How can I breath  
When my heart's in my mouth  
And not on my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
It's a long way down  
It's a long way down  
The people look so small  
Sliding off the wall  
Getting dizzy as the fall in the gutter  
I watch the seagull  
Swooping past the steeple  
Crying for his dinner as he shits on the sinners  
Now that I see it  
How can I breathe  
When my heart's in my mouth  
Instead of my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
It's a long way down  
Mama  
An eye for an eye  
You'd say you'd never take a side  
Papa  
I'm too young to die  
They're never taking me  
They're never taking me alive  
They're never taking me alive  
They're never taking me alive
