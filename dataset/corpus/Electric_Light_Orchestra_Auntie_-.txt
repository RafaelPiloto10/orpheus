Got love, if that's what you need  
I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee  
I got love waitin' for you  
I come sneakin' round the corner of the avenue  
  
You gotta ma-ma-ma belle, or I will get you  
You know you gotta ma-ma-ma belle, before I get you  
  
There's one thing that's on my mind  
And that's getting hold of you before I serve my time  
I'll keep on, with my heavy load  
Till I see you come a strollin' down that open road  
  
You gotta ma-ma-ma belle, or I will get you  
You know you gotta ma-ma-ma belle, before I get you  
  
I love you ma-ma-ma belle  
That's why I want to get it all well I'm sure you can tell  
I got, good soul, runnin' so deep  
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep  
Can't you hear me once ma-ma-ma belle  
  
You gotta ma-ma-ma belle, or I will get you  
You know you gotta ma-ma-ma belle, before I get you
