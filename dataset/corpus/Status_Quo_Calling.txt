I've never been a loner  
Never been to California but I wanted to  
I thought it was dreams in my head  
I've never been a moaner  
But I'll get to Arizona if it kills me to  
I wish I could fly from my bed  
  
And it's calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling my way home  
  
I wrote a little letter  
But it didn't make it better, I was aiming to  
But you read it wrong, what I said  
Hold on, it doesn't matter  
What was written in the letter and I'm telling you  
It's not just some dream in my head  
  
And it's calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling my way home  
  
I could always go along without you  
You know I could do it alone and I would  
'Cause I'm a prima donna, gonna go ahead  
I'm gonna, gonna get my own way if I can  
  
And it keeps calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling, crawling
