I can hear that old clock ticking, passing time up on the wall I can hear the
faucet dripin in the kitchen down the hall to the one that I keep missing
every night and every day  
There's things you learn to live with now that's all but I'll never get used
to living without you  
Now I got used to tenderness, we would hold each other tight and I got used to
happiness we'd make love day and night and I'll get used to mornings sitting
in the evening when there's  
There's things you learn to live with now that's all I ever do but ill never
get used to living without you  
Without you, the sun sill rises without you, the river run I thought by now
that I'd be realizing what's done is done I accept the notion that there's
things we can't control like the changin of the seasons or the fact we're
growing old I know I'm the reason that you had to go away I will keep
believing that s the price we had to pay chorus oh there's things you learn to
live with repeat
