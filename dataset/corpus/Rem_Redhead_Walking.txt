Out there are silver dressed darlings  
And ramen mein delights  
When ginger hair gets all fired up  
She beats them in the night  
That redhead walking, uh  
  
Don't get close  
She'll warn you with her growl  
She's a bud cuttin', star studded, leather chested girl  
Out there a redhead walkin'  
Redhead walkin'  
The redhead walkin'  
Better listen keep your distance from the crimson crime warpath  
  
O kiss that girl  
Kiss that girl  
Kiss that girt  
  
Yeah, she'll cut your heart like diamonds  
End of story  
You bet you're gonna lose it to that hellbound crimson glory  
  
There - a redhead walkin'  
A redhead walkin'  
A redhead walkin'  
Heed what this wise man says  
Keep away from redheads...
