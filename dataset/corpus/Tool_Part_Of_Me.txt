I know you well.  
You are a part of me.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
I know you best,  
Better than anyone.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
You don't judge.  
You can't speak.  
You can't leave.  
You can't hurt me.  
You're just here for me to use.  
I know you best,  
Better than one might think.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
It's time for you  
To make a sacrifice.  
It's time to die a little.  
Give it up.  
You are a part of me.
