Wait for your call, love  
The call never came  
Ready to fall up  
Ready to claim  
  
I'm ready for it all, love  
I'm ready for the pain  
Meet under sun and  
Meet me again  
In the rain  
In the rain  
The rain  
  
Behind the walls, love  
I'm trying to change  
And I'm ready for it all, love  
I'm ready for the change  
Meet me in blue sky  
Meet me again  
In the rain  
The rain, in the rain  
In the rain  
  
The rain  
  
Got to find yourself alone in this world  
You've got to find yourself alone
