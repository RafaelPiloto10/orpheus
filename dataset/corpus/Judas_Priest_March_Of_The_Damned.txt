We're walking the streets  
We know where we'll meet  
  
Can't stop us  
They don't know why they try  
Can't hurt us  
We'll never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
We know what's at stake  
Won't take your mistakes  
  
Can't break us  
We'll never fall, that's all  
It's over  
Just watch us grow  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
We're walking the streets  
We know where we'll meet  
  
Can't stop us  
They don't know why they try  
Can't hurt us  
We'll never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
  
Of the damned  
  
March of the damned
