What's the name of the game  
Age of time  
Looking through the windows  
It's the age of time  
Traveling through the world  
Age of time  
Leaves no room for longing  
For a love like blood in me  
A love like blood that never dies  
  
What's the name of the game  
Thinking about our story  
What's the name of the game  
Honey don't you worry  
You're the code to my heart  
Be my own redeemer  
What a combination, baby  
I want to be  
  
What's the name of the game  
Young at heart  
I know what we're needing  
But the age of time  
Is spreading through the world  
God takes shape  
Who can run the game now  
That the love like blood in me  
A love like blood that never dies  
  
What's the name of the game  
Thinking about our story  
What's the name of the game  
Honey don't you worry  
You're the code to my heart  
Be my own redeemer  
What a combination, baby  
I want to be  
  
What's the name of the game  
What's the name of the game  
  
I stand in the line I do as I'm told  
But burning within is you  
I follow you today  
I follow you today  
I follow you  
I'm your disciple  
A love like blood that never dies  
  
What's the name of the game  
Thinking about our story  
What's the name of the game  
Honey don't you worry  
You're the code to my heart  
Be my own redeemer  
What a combination, baby  
I want to be  
  
What's the name of the game  
Thinking about our story  
What's the name of the game  
Honey don't you worry  
You're the code to my heart  
Be my own redeemer  
What a combination, baby  
  
What's the name of the game
