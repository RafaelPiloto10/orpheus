Now you told me on a Sunday that it wasn't gonna work  
I tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt  
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out  
I knew what you were thinkin' before you'd say it aloud  
  
Don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not even breaking  
You're not worth the time that this is taking  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Every time you lie  
  
I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face  
And a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place  
Less trashier, much classier then who you prove to be  
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me, oh no  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
At night awake  
I won't be sleeping 'til morning breaks  
That's the price you pay, for your mistakes  
Goodbye to dreaming  
  
So don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Don't say you're sorry  
Every time you lie  
Don't say you're sorry  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
