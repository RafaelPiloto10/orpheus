One tropic summer those high flyin' mans you've been thinkin'  
You know the ones that have been flyin' too low, oh  
Look up at some of those airplanes risin' and takin'  
To see the ones that are flyin' to low

Talk about  
  
With the power of soul  
Anything is possible  
With the power of you  
Anything you want to do  
  
Flyin' through the air on a kite every day and every night  
Just up there, it escape her wrist  
Sometimes the wind ain't right  
Yeah, I'm playin' too much with one toy baby  
Just up there, it escape to the crippled night  
Oh yeah

You sayin' flotation is groovy baby  
And even he'll tell you that  
Yeah, gettin' high every day is easy  
And the floatin' around even if jellyfish will agree to that  
Yeah, I'm singin' with a power  
Aren't you?  
Is that the way you want to be baby, look out now  
Hhmm.  
  
With the power  
Anything, anything you want to do  
  
With the power of soul  
Anything is possible  
With the power of you  
Anything you want to do  
  
With the power of soul  
Anything is possible  
With the power of you  
Anything you want to do  
Oh yeah
