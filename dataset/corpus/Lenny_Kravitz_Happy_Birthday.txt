This morning is a special morning  
We gonna party all day long  
Wel gonna celebrate the day that you were born  
And we will start with this song  
  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
All of your friends will come together  
And all your family will be here  
We gonna cook you all the food we know you love  
And wash it down with lots of beer  
  
There comes a time for cake and candles  
You make a wish for all the year  
We rather have you blow that fire out  
And we will all stand up and cheer  
  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
There comes the time to open presents  
Whether they hand me or not  
They will be filled with all the love we have for you  
  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Happy, happy, happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you
