I'm just a shy guy,  
My, I'm a 'fraid-to-try guy  
No lie.  
There's a gal that I idolize  
But I just can't seem to hypnotize.  
And when she pets me,  
You betcha, it gets me.  
And everytime I hold her hand,  
I'm just too shy to say the things I plan.  
Everytime she's close to me,  
My heart is filled with ecstasy,  
And like a dope, I let the chance slip by.  
There, I should have told her then  
But all I did was sit and grin,  
And I ended up so mad that I could cry.  
'Cause I'm a shy guy  
Wish I was a sly guy  
Then I could say, "Baby, baby, I love you"  
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do.  
I'm just a shy guy
