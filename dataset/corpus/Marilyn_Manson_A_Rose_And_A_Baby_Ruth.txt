A Rose and a Baby Ruth  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
  
We had a quarrel  
A teenage quarrel  
Now I'm as blue as I know how to be  
I can't call you on the phone  
I can't even see you at your home  
  
So I'm sending you this present  
Just to prove that I'm telling the truth  
Dear, I believe you won't laugh when you receive  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh  
  
I could have sent you an orchid of some kind  
But that's all I had in my jeans at the time  
  
But when we grow up  
Some day I'll show up  
Just to prove I was telling the truth  
I'll kiss you too then I'll hand to you  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo
