The day we meet again  
I'll be waiting there, I'll be waiting there for you  
'cause the years have been so lonely, like a dog without a home  
It's dangerous when you find out  
You've been drinking on your own  
The day we meet again  
We will walk in peace through the garden, down the road  
Where the mist of time is lifting  
See it rise in the air, like the shadow I was chasing  
When I looked, it wasn't there, oh, no  
Just in case you're wondering  
What was really on my mind  
It wasn't what you took my love  
It's what you left behind  
Just in case you're wondering  
Will it really be the same?  
Will it really be the same?  
You know we're only living for the day we meet again  
So hold on and don't let go  
Time, it heals, you know, I know  
The day we meet again  
I'll be waiting there, I'll be waiting there for you  
'cause the years have been so lonely, like a dog without a home  
It's dangerous when you find out  
You've been drinking on your own  
The day we meet again  
We will walk in peace through the garden, down the road  
Where the mist of time is lifting  
See it rise in the air, like the shadow I was chasing  
When I looked, oh, no, it wasn't there, oh, no  
Oh, no  
It wasn't there, it wasn't there, it wasn't there  
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
