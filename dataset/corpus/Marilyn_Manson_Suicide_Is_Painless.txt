Through early morning fog I see  
Visions of the things to be  
The pains that are withheld for me  
I realise and I can see  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
I can take or leave it if I please  
  
That game of life is hard to play  
I'm gonna lose it anyway  
The losing card I'll some day lay  
So this is all I have to say  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
I can take or leave it if I please  
  
The sword of time will pierce our skin  
It doesn't hurt when it begins  
But as it works its way on in  
The pain grows stronger, watch it grin  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please  
  
A brave man once requested me  
To answer questions that are key  
Is it to be or not to be  
And I replied oh why ask me  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I...  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
I can take or leave it if I please  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And you can do the same thing if you please
