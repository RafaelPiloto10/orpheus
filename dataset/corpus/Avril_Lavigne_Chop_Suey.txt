Wake up, (Wake up)  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup,  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?  
Here you go create another fable  
  
You wanted to,  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup,  
You wanted to,  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup,  
You wanted to,  
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table,  
You wanted to,  
  
I don't think you trust,  
In, my, self righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die! Rrrrrrraaa!

In, my, self-righteous suicide, I, cry  
When angels deserve to die.  
  
Father, Father, Father, Father,  
Fall into your hands, I commend my spirit,  
Fall into your hands,  
Why have you forsaken me,  
In your eyes forsaken me,  
In your thoughts forsaken me,  
In your heart forsaken, me oh,  
  
Trust in my self-righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die,  
In my self righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die.
