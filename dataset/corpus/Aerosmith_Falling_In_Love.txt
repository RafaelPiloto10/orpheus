You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You think you're in love  
Like it's a real sure thing  
But every time you fall  
You get yo' ass in a sling  
You used to be strong  
But now it's "ooh baby please"  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
We was making love  
When you told me that you loved me  
I thought ol' cupid  
He was taking aim  
I was believer when you told me  
That you loved me  
And then you called me  
Someone else's name  
  
There ain't gonna be no more  
Beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so  
  
Chip off the old block  
Man, you're so much like your sister  
My fantasize it must be out of luck  
My old libido has been  
Blowing a transistor  
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck  
Yeah  
  
I'm Jones' in' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will  
Bbut there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
What are you looking for  
It's got to be hard core  
Must be some kind of nouveau riche  
  
Is this your only chance  
Or some hypnotic trance  
Let's get you on a tighter leash  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You ain't that good  
Is what you said  
Down to the letter  
But you like the way  
I hold the microphone  
Sometimes I good but  
When I'm bad I'm even badder  
Don't give me no lip  
I've got enough of my own  
  
There ain't gonna be  
No more beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
I'm jonesin' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will, yeah  
But there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
