He stays home from work this time  
He never really told his wife  
He never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.  
It's alright.  
No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.  
The man deserves a medal  
But he's never really won a prize before.  
He goes to lock the door.  
  
He is falling  
And though he knows it's not  
The world looks down and frowns.  
  
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,  
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.  
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.  
  
We all need you now.  
  
Someone said where you going  
Someone said to you goodbye  
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times  
They blame it on the time.  
We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife  
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.  
And we blame it on the times.  
  
Oh he is falling  
And though he knows it's not  
The world looks down and frowns.  
  
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.  
  
We all need you now  
  
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
  
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.  
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.
