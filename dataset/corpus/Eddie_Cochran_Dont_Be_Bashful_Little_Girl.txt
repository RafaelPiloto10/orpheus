Don't be bashful little girl, won't-won't you say hello  
Don't you see me lookin' at the one I could love so  
Woh-woh-won't you let me hold your hand  
Try-y--y to steal a kiss or two  
Maybe-baby, little baby maybe we could fall in love  
Like I'm fallin' in love with you  
  
Don't be bashful little girl, you look so all alone  
Let me be the one tonight, the one to take you home  
Woh-woh-won't you let me hold your hand  
Try-y-y to steal a kiss or two  
And maybe-baby, little baby maybe we could fall in love  
Like I'm fallin' in love with you  
Like I'm fallin' in love with you  
Like I'm fallin' in love with you
