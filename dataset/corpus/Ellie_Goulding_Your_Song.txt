It's a little bit funny  
This feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can  
Easily hide  
  
I don't have much money  
But boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where  
We both could live.  
  
So excuse me forgetting  
But these things I do  
See I've forgotten if  
They're green or they're blue  
  
Anyway the thing is,  
What I really mean,  
Yours are the sweetest eyes  
I've ever seen  
  
And you can tell everybody  
This is your song  
It maybe quite simple but  
Now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is  
Now you're in the world  
  
If I was a sculptor  
But then again no  
Or a girl who makes potions in  
A traveling show  
I know it's not much but  
It's the best I can do.  
My gift is my song and  
This one's for you.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And you can tell everybody  
This is your song  
It may be quite simple but  
Now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is  
Now you're in the world.
