I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then like my dreams they fade and die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They f-f-fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then in my d-d-dreams they fade and d-d-die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles, no more troubles  
Pretty bubbles in the air
