Life begins at thirty  
So I have been told  
I can easily believe it  
The way I'm getting on  
Yeh I'm getting on  
You hang around backstreet bars  
For what you wish you knew  
You say give me something cheap  
Something I won't want to keep  
Love's not everything  
I was just hoping you might stay  
Hell it's hard to say  
I was hoping you might stick around  
Until the morning  
You've heard it all before kid  
I'll say it all again  
And I'm going to live a lush life  
An ask for nothing much life  
Love's not everything  
I was just hoping you might stay  
Hell it's hard to say  
I was hoping you might stick around  
If you were doing nothing  
Fool for love...  
I was just hoping you might stay  
But it's not easy to say  
Hey...you doing nothing?  
Fool for love  
And it's not only the lonely  
Not only the lonely  
Fall for love
