You're happy all the time  
I just don't understand why I can't be happy too  
Your smiles are salt in the wound  
A slap upon a back that's been toiling in the sun  
  
When will I get mine?  
Or must I be a God-fearing, white American?  
Oh everything is fine  
As long as you're a God-fearing, white American  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
  
The man about the town  
The beauty queen, the paragon of civilization  
But shadows cling to us all  
Even those convinced that they're sheltered and immune  
  
Oh when will I get mine?  
Or must I be a God-fearing, white American?  
Yeah  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all
