I'll get down on my knees  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll even walk upon water  
I'll burn the soul of a man  
I'm so sick with pain  
I'm so sick with need  
I'll lay before the cross and pray  
I've done nothing to you  
I'll bleed like holy rain  
I'll say I'm searching for the truth  
I'll rip the skin from God's face  
If it can guide me to you  
I'll give life to disease  
I'll steal the light from Heavens gate  
I'll give life to obsession  
And then I'll do as I please  
I'll give you one last sin or cure  
I've got something for you
