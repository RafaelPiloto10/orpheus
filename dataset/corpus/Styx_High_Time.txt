I flip the switch on my laser video  
And there's the man staring back at me  
He starts to speak in a voice so righteous  
About the sins of society  
  
He's got answers to all my problems  
Says he'll decide what I should hear and see  
I try to change to another station  
But all I get is more of his morality  
And morality, yeah  
  
But I see the kids of a new generation  
And they won't stand for this mind control  
They're gonna change this world we live in  
They're gonna bring back the rock and roll  
  
So if I can, I'm gonna break from this prison  
Gonna get out and join in the fight  
Take a chance on what I believe in  
Win or lose, I know it's right  
  
'Cause it's high time  
For us to start a revolution  
High time  
Just like an A-bomb explosion  
High time  
It ain't the music that's in question  
High time  
It's more the freedom of expression  
  
Change is comin'  
Mind Police are comin'  
We're on the move  
The Old World is crumblin'  
A new day's comin'  
Tell your friends and relations  
We're on the move  
We're gonna start a rockin' nation  
  
High time  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
High time  
We're gonna start a revolution  
High time

Your avoidance tactics have proven disappointing."

"No deviance, Kilroy!"  
  
High time  
For us to start a revolution  
High time  
Just like an A-bomb explosion  
High time  
It ain't the music that's in question  
High time  
It's more the freedom of expression  
  
Change is comin'  
Mind Police are comin'  
We're on the move
