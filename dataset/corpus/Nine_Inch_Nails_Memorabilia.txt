(what do your nipples look like)  
  
wherever i go  
  
i take a little piece of you  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
photographs i took of you  
  
well times i passed through  
  
so many faces  
  
so many places  
  
i have got to have a memory  
  
i have never been there  
  
i have never had you  
  
i can't remember  
  
give me your reminder  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia  
  
(now girl..only it's flavor..bow down here)  
  
keychains and snowstorms  
  
the taste of your sweat  
  
the look in your eye  
  
i have been inside you  
  
i know what it feels like  
  
(wet as it is..the whiter the honey)  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia  
  
(goodies come in here all day)  
  
give me your reminder  
  
i can't remember  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia
