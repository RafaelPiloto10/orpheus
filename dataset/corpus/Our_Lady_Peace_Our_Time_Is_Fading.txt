Cut my wings, I'm growing them back today  
Tomorrow's uptight, tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's not today  
So I don't want to feel alive  
I don't want to touch the sky  
Will everybody trip? Will everybody slip?  
Come down, come down  
  
And I know our time is fading  
And I know you're here to save me  
I've been patiently waiting  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
I know we're up and fading  
And I know there is no escaping  
I've been patiently waiting It's alright, it's alright it's all  
  
Trap me up, you're up in my face  
Tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's not today  
So I don't want to fall on time  
And I don't to feel alive  
Will everybody trip? Will everybody slip?  
  
Come down, come down  
  
Well I know our time is fading  
And I know you're here to save me  
I've been patiently waiting  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
And I know we're up and fading  
And I know there is no escaping I've been patiently waiting  
It's alright, it's alright, all.. right  
Yeah, you oh yeah-ah yeah, ah, ah  
  
Cut my wings off  
Suffocate me  
  
And I know our time is fading  
And I know there's no escaping  
I've been patiently waiting  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
And I know we're up and fading  
And I know there is no escaping  
I've been patiently waiting  
It's alright, it's alright it's alright
