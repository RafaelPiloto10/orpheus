My deja vu, you're my obsession  
my deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
We'll get the magic back again  
  
My deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
I want to see you dancing naked  
I want to see you touch the moon  
  
But when I try to reach your fingers  
You just vanish into air  
I want to feel you with my senses  
'Cause I'm almost sure the texture  
  
Of your skin  
is gonna tell me who you are  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
  
My deja vu  
I want to hold you like I used to  
I want to feel you in my blood  
I wonder why I do confess this  
  
To myself all the time  
I know the time is working against us  
But I'll long for you the rest of my whole life  
Like a prisoner of hope  
  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
I have tried to get to know you  
To get you off my mind  
  
It feels like going back in time  
And snap, I see your figure once again  
My deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
My deja vu you're my obsession
