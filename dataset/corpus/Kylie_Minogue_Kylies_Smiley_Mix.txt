I'm seeing in your way  
But I don't believe it's true  
That I'm not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong  
For us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
I hope that you find someone  
Who can love you like I do  
I'll be strong inside  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
It's no secret (x4)  
  
When I first meet you  
How you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow  
You just seem to drift away  
  
Then I discovered  
That you were cheating  
You were cheating on me  
But I was the last to know  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Our love was a life  
And it's no secret  
It's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret  
Because you told everybody  
  
Rain falling down  
Another minute passes by  
I'll wait for you  
But this time I won't cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
It's not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
I, I, I'm wondering why  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Did you believe I'd let you down  
Your jealous heart  
Gave you the runaround  
You couldn't see that  
I would always be a friend  
If you could look inside your heart  
And understand what's tearing you apart  
You gotta trust someone  
Don't let hate get in the way  
  
Just turn it into love  
Turn it into love  
And open up your heart  
And you'll never feel ashamed  
If you turn it, turn it  
Turn it into love  
  
In my imagination  
There is no complication  
I dream about you all the time  
In my mind of celebration  
The sweetest of sensation  
Thinking you could be mine  
In my imagination  
There is no hesitation  
We walk together hand in hand  
I'm dreaming  
  
You fell in love with me  
Like I'm in love with you  
But dreaming's all I do  
If only they'd come true  
  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
  
You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying  
Won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time  
Till I can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect  
To get a guarantee  
It's just that I believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share  
Of hearts broken  
And I don't wanna take that anymore  
  
All aboard!
