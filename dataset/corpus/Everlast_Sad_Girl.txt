I seen her at a stop light on Alverano  
Was sittin' in a pearl white Eldorado  
In a gangsta lean she were revvin' the throttle  
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano  
She looked like Selena, the truth couldn't be plainer  
She like a gangsta boogie, her mama calls her cookie  
My friends call her a sad girl cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on  
I seen her at the market she was pushing a stroller  
Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda  
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her  
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder  
She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil  
She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel  
She's a sad girl, cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on  
Hey sad girl, we can take this slow  
Baby what you lookin' for, let me know  
You say you want a man that can give you some dough  
You say buy my babyshoes and buy him a coat  
And buy my baby food to put down his throat  
I won't play you like a ho, it ain't like that yo  
Let me holler at you later, we can go to the show  
I ain't tryna rock the boat, I'm tryna keep you afloat  
I seen her at the post office mailing a letter  
She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater  
She's talking on the pay phone and something upset her  
I really want to hold her but I only just met her  
But I could tell she'd been crying, she said she felt like dying  
She never been so alone no, she gotta make it on her own though  
She's a sad girl, cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on
