Bolt-lock your doors  
Alarm your cars  
And still we move in closer  
Every day  
Top of the list  
Is your smiling kids  
But we'll be smiling too  
So that's ok  
Oh, and by the way  
Thank you, because you're  
Giving, giving, giving  
And we're receiving -  
No, no, we're taking  
Keeping the population down  
Your taxes paid, but  
Police waylaid  
And we knows  
When the school bus  
Comes and goes  
We're on your street, but  
You don't see us  
Or, if you do  
You smile and say Hello  
But don't underestimate us  
When you are  
Giving, giving, giving  
And we're receiving -  
No, no, we're taking  
We're just keeping  
The population down  
Giving, giving, giving  
Well, it's your own fault  
For reproducing  
We're just keeping  
The population down
