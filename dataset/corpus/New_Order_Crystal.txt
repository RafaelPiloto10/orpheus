We're like crystal  
(Hey)  
We break easy  
(Hoo)  
I'm a poor man  
(Hey)  
If you leave me  
(Hoo)  
I'm applauded  
(Hey)  
Then forgotten  
It was summer  
(Hey)  
Now it's autumn  
(Hoo)  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
(Hoo, hey)  
We're like crystal  
(Hey)  
It's not easy  
(Hoo)  
With your love  
(Hey)  
You could feed me  
(Hoo)  
Every man  
(Hey)  
And every woman  
(Hoo)  
Needs someone  
(Hey)  
So keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You're not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You're not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming
