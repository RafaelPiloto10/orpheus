Behind the sun - I found some one - my china woman, oh no  
She's painting clouds - day in day out - my china girl, don't go  
Oh I can't oh I can't, oh I can't ignore  
The way she looks to me  
Oh I can't - oh I can't - oh I can't give her more  
Just my heart, she is my destiny  
  
She has China in her eyes - can't you see it  
China in her eyes - can't you feel it  
China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my china woman, oh no  
I miss you so, can't let you go - my china girl - don't go  
  
Behind brown eyes, she's mystify - my china woman, oh no  
It's like a dream the moon turns green - my china girl, don't go  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'll fly  
I'm writing hearts to you  
And I wait and I wait, see a rose in the sky  
Take my heart, what have I got to do
