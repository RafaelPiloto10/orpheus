When you cry  
I know you've got a good reason to cry  
If you can't come  
I know it's not just an alibi  
Now I hear things that are better kept under the hat  
Who backs it up?  
Look at your hand, you can count on that  
When you talk, it's hard to disagree  
And when you dance, you're talking to me  
When you stand, you stand for something  
Stand for something  
They can't dim your flame  
When you stand, you stand for something  
Stand for something  
They can't bend your stream  
Here I stand  
Outside the world of political  
I would not lose that  
For all the gold in South Africa  
What you wear did not come easy  
What you hear sounds different to me  
When you stand, you're standing next to me  
You put your foot down every day  
Make sure you bring it down on the up beat  
So walk away those feet of clay  
We are fighting and dancing in the street
