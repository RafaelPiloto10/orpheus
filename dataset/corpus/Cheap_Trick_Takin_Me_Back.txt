You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
It's so easy to tell  
You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
A long, long, long time ago  
A long, long, long, time ago  
You, you let me down-you didn't think of me  
I-I won't forget what you did to me-no  
  
You were nice not to say it  
Now my heart it's breakin'  
You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
A long, long, long time ago  
A long, long, long, time ago  
You, you thought that you- could make a fool of me  
Don't don't be so sure that the fool was me- no  
  
I held up I could take it  
Now my heart it's breakin'  
You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
A long, long, long time ago  
A long, long, long, time ago  
A long time ago-a long time ago  
A long time ago- you were breakin'  
My heart- I never found all the parts  
  
A long time ago-a long time ago  
A long time ago-oh-oh-oh  
You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
It's so easy to tell  
You're takin' me back  
It's written on my face  
You're takin' me back  
It's so easy to tell- 'cause you're  
  
(modulate)  
Takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
It's written on my face  
You're takin' me back  
I remember it well  
You're takin' me back  
A long,long,long time ago  
A long,long,long time ago  
A long,long,long time ago  
A long,long,long time ago  
You're takin' me back
