Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a fly  
Wearing a tie?"  
Down by the bay.  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a bear  
Combing his hair?"  
Down by the bay.  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a moose  
Kissing a goose?"  
Down by the bay.  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a whale  
With a polka dot tail?"  
Down by the bay.  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a llama  
Wearing pajamas?"  
Down by the bay.  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever have a time  
When you couldn't make a rhyme?"  
Down by the bay
