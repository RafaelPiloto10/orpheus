I have got a secret, hidden behind my eyes.  
A violation tragedy! of violence hate and lies.  
Locked deep within a chamber, dark reccesses of my mind...  
A tribute to insanity! through hours days and time.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
Recite the testimonial, truth and nothing more.  
Accusations nominal! fall rotten to the core.  
So take a look, read a book, reach a new plateau...!  
But stain the soul a life you took,  
you know not what I know.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
Misguided youth the bitter truth  
Nothing left to chance...  
Fallen angel seeking adventure, new romance.  
How dare you touch you take the soul  
Of one so pure so... white..!  
The violation tragedy  
Took all she had that... night!!!  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
I have got a secret hidden behind my eyes.  
A violation tragedy! of violence hate and lies.  
Recite the testimonial, truth and nothing more.  
Accusations nominal! fall rotten to the core.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
To the core!  
  
Rot rot, rot rot, rot  
Rot rot, rot rot, rotten! rotten! rot!  
To the core!!!
