Sightless the one who relays on promise  
Blind he who follows the path of vows  
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception  
But they who fathom the truth bellow  
  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game  
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge  
Exploiting innocence for himself  
Dangerous he whom our faith was given  
Broad is the road leading straight to hell  
  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game  
Dangerous he whom our faith was given  
Broad is the road leading straight to hell  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game
