Waltzing round the room tonight  
In someone elses clothes  
Youre always coming out of things  
Smelling like a rose  
You hang your head and your heart is filled with so much misery  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
  
You say lets go to the rodeo  
And see some cowboy fall  
Sometimes it seems to me youve  
Got no sympathy at all  
You keep on going on and on about how you're so free  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
  
It aint easy to get to you  
But there must be some kind of a way  
If only two could look to you  
For only one moment of each day  
  
Youre saying that you're all washed up  
Got nothing else to give  
Seems like you never figured out  
How long you have to live  
You could feel like a baby again sitting on your daddys knee  
Oh how happy you would be  
If you belonged to me  
  
The guy your with is a ruthless pimp  
Everybody knows  
Every cent he takes from you  
Goes straight up his nose  
You look so sad, you're going so mad, any fool can see  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me
