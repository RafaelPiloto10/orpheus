This here is on some truthful shit  
It seems like everything I do, your used to it  
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with  
That's when I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside  
So you still think I'm confident and damn  
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastool  
Are we moving too fast?  
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?  
  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
  
This here is something personal  
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible  
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know  
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside  
So I don?t ever question you and damn  
I can't even find, the perfect brush  
So I can paint what's going through my mind  
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?  
  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Brand new girl  
  
Is anything I'm doing brand new  
Is everything I'm doing too late  
  
Did he take off your clothes off just like this  
Did he give you loving just like this  
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date  
Tell me baby am I too late?
