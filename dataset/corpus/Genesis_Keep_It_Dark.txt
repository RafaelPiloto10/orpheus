Found that man reported missing,  
He wandered in his home.  
It don't seem to bad if you consider  
Just what he's been through.  
  
Seems he met up with a gang of thieves,  
Who mistook him for a man of means,  
They locked him up then found he had no money,  
So they let him go again.  
Now he's back at home and happy  
Just to see the kids.  
  
I wish that I could really tell you  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen.  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy,  
Cities of light with no fear of war,  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives,  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide.  
  
Oh, keep it dark.  
  
It seems strange to have to lie,  
About a world so bright.  
And tell instead a made-up story,  
From the world of night.  
  
I wish, that I could really tell you,  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen,  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy,  
Cities of light with no fear of war,  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives,  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to lie,  
No need to hate,  
No need to hide.  
  
Oh, keep it dark.
