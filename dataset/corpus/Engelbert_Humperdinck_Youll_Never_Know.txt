You'll never know just how much I miss you  
You'll never know just how much I care  
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you  
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so  
  
A million or more times?  
You went away and my heart went with you  
I speak your name in my every prayer  
If there is some other way to prove that I love you  
  
I swear I don't know how  
You'll never know if you don't know now  
(You went away and my heart went with you  
I speak your name in my every prayer)  
  
If there is some other way to prove that I love you  
I swear I don't know how  
You'll never know if you don't know now  
You'll never know if you don't know now
