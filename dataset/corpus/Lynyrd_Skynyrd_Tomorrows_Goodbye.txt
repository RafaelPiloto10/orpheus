I'm just a city boy  
But there's a small town side to me  
And I feel it closin' in  
  
Are we too blind to see  
That she's die-in' more each day  
And she's cryin' out to you and me  
  
Chance is comin' when thier gone  
They curse a fool who waits too long  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday, could be tomorrow's goodbye  
  
Here comes the rain. it might wash her tears away  
But it doesn't change a thing  
Like my brother before me  
All I can do is write this song and for her I sing  
  
Chance is comin' when we're gone  
They carve in stone what we've done wrong  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday could be tomorrow's goodbye  
  
Do you ever think about the future or the past  
Do you ever wonder how long this world will last  
  
So let's take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Now it's right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday, will be tomorrow's goodbye
