[Chorus]  
I wanna thank you for the things you've done  
I wanna thank you for your generosity  
And I'll never be alone, that's because, that's because you are my friend  
That's because, that's because you are my friend  
  
Been through thick and thin together  
Through the ups and downs, yet we still remain  
And I can talk to you forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before I met you, I was real low, now everyone know  
Now that I know you hey I'm real high  
I wanna thank you for the day and nights  
I wanna thank you for the breath of life  
Without you I'd be lost  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as long, just as long as you're my friend  
Just as long, just as long as you're my friend  
That's because you are my friend, you are my friend
