This was my last mistake  
That's all her heart could take  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
Her lips won't kiss me now  
The lips that I taught how  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye
