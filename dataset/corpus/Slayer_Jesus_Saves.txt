You go to the church, you kiss the cross  
You will be saved at any cost  
You have your own reality  
Christianity  
You spend your life just kissing ass  
A trait that's grown as time has passed  
You think the world will end today  
You praise the Lord, it's all you say  
  
Jesus saves, listen to you pray  
You think you'll see the pearly gates  
When death takes you away  
  
For all respect you cannot lust  
In an invisible man you place your trust  
Indirect dependency  
Eternal attempt at amnesty  
He will decide who lives and dies  
Depopulate Satanas rise  
You will be an accessory  
Irreverence and blasphemy  
  
Jesus saves, no need to pray  
The gates of pearl have turned to gold  
It seems you've lost your way  
  
Jesus saves, no words of praise  
No promised land to take you to  
There is no other way
