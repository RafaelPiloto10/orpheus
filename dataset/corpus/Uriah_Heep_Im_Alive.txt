How strange when  
You know the feeling  
That something ain't right  
You're fooled by the need of being  
You're blind to the light  
Don't ask where  
The stranger leads you  
He'll show you the way  
Just go out and make your conquest  
You've something to say  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive and I'm me  
I've just got to be free  
I'm alive to the world  
  
There's been so much  
Bad time wasted  
Just look and you'll see  
We've got so much going for us  
It's not just a dream  
Let's look and we'll find the answers  
To questions I've made  
We'll reach out for new beginnings  
Let love show the way  
  
Let's leave our past behind  
The love can make us blind  
But now we know  
That we're alive
