I used to lead a quiet life  
In fact it was a bare existence  
I passed out on many floors  
I don't do that any more  
  
Hello my friends  
Is everybody happy?  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
I'm a conservative  
  
I like the small black marks on my hands  
I'm a conservative  
I like the crazy girls that I screw  
Hey I know them all well  
  
And when I run out of bread I laugh  
All the way to the bank  
Sometimes I pause for a drink  
Conservatism ain't no easy job  
  
I smile in the mornings  
I live without a care  
Nothing is denied me  
And nothing ever hurts  
  
I got bored so I'm making my millions  
When you're conservative you get a better break  
You're always on the rigltt side  
When you're conservative  
  
You walk with pride  
Pride is on your side  
Pride pride pride  
Is on our side  
Oh boy  
Pride is on our side  
  
I like my beer  
I like my bread  
I love my girl  
I love my head  
  
I'm in the clear man  
I'm in the dear  
Because I'm a conservative  
I'm a conservative  
I really am  
Ohyeslam  
  
And it would mean so much to me  
If you would only be like me  
Yes it could mean so much to me  
  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
I'm a conservative
