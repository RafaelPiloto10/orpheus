Can you tell me  
Who called the race?  
Can anyone stay in one place?  
And when you get to the finish line  
Will you wish for more time or say  
  
One day  
One day you will  
But maybe one day you will find  
That you just can't push rewind  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
Be here with me now  
  
Do you ever think that  
We're just chasing our tails?  
Like life is one big fast treadmill  
And we pop what is prescribed  
If it gets us first prize but you know  
Who I  
Who I think will win  
Are the ones that love loving  
Are the ones that take the time  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
Be here with me now  
Be here with me now  
  
'Cause refuge check is right now, right in front on you  
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do  
If you check right now, I'm in front of you  
Baby don't blink and miss  
  
This moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me yeah  
Be here with me now
