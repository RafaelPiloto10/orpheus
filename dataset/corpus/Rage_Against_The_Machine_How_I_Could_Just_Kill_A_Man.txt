Hey don't miss out on what you're passing  
You're missing the hootah of the funky buddah  
Eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked  
So come on as I start to kick it  
Cause we're like outlaws striding while suckers are hiding  
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving by'  
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putos  
Acting kind of loco I'm just another local  
Kid from the street getting paid for my vocals  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
  
I be doing all the dumb shit yo  
Cause nothing is coming from it  
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming  
Humming coming at ya! then you know I had to gat ya!  
Time for some action just a fraction of friction  
I got the clearance to run the interference  
In to your satellite shining a battle light  
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right  
Here's an example just a little sample:  
How could I just kill a man  
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome  
I said yo it's on. take cover son or you're assed out  
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out  
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay  
So I just killed a man  
  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
  
It's gonna be a long time before I finish  
One of the many missions that I have to establish  
To lite my spliff ignite you with insite so if you ain't down  
Bullshit. say some punk tried to get you for your auto  
Would call the one time and play the role model?  
No! I think you'll play like a thug  
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!  
Yeah you know I'm going to gat ya, how do you know where I'm at  
When you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from  
While you're up on the hill in your big home  
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a faster ducket  
Just to stay alive yo I got to say fuck it  
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man  
  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand  
How I could just kill a man  
Here is something you can't understand
