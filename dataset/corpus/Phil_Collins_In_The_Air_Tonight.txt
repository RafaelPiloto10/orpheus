I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
Well if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand  
I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am  
Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes  
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been  
It's all been a pack of lies  
  
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
Well I remember, I remember, don't worry, how could I ever forget  
It's the first time, the last time we ever met  
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, oh no you don't fool me  
Well the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows  
It's no stranger to you and me  
  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh
Lord
