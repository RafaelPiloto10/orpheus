Leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground  
I heard a story from the man in red  
He said, the leaves are fallin' down  
Such a beautiful sound  
Son, I think you'd better go ahead  
But you always hold your head up high  
Cause it's a long, long, long way down  
This town was meant for passing through  
Boy, it ain't nothin' new  
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round  
But it's a long, long, long way down  
  
You better run for the hills  
Before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been tryin' hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
  
Run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I shake a little  
Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk  
I shake a little  
Sometimes I hate the line I walk  
I just wanna to show you what I know  
Catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been trying hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
  
Now Adam's taking bombs, and he's stuck on his mom  
Because that bitch keeps tryin' to make him pray  
He's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark  
Just tryin' to get some of that little-girl play  
  
You better run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been tryin' hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This pain is hell in me tonight  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
  
And cars are everywhere  
Raisin' dust at the fairground  
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights  
But there's somethin' pullin' me  
The circus and the crew  
Well, they're just passin' through  
Makin' sure the merry still goes 'round  
But it's a long, long, long way down
