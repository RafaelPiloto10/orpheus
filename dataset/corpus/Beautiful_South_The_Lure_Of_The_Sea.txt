If I walk like a fool, I've walked like that since school  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Who knows the effect,  
That whisky could've had on me  
It could've been the lure of the sea  
  
'Cause leather ain't as strong as the weather  
But leather can strangle any dream  
And leather ain't as strong as the weather  
But leather took Curtis from me  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea,  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Once I felt chained, and now, now I feel free  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Polo and Da Gama,  
Well those two had nothing on me  
Could be I'm a sucker for the sea  
  
'Cause silver, ain't as quick as the tongue  
But silver, took the M.L.K so young  
And metal ain't as strong as the petal  
But metal left the verse unsung  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea,  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Freedom's taken a liking to me  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Look in my eyes 'cause my belt's broke free  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
The Pirates Of Penzance,  
They have nothing on me  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea
