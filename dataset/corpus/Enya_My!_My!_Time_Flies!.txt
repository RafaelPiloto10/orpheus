My! My! Time flies! One step and we're on the moon, next step into the stars  
My! My! Time flies! Maybe we could be there soon, a one way ticket to mars  
  
My! My! Time flies! A man underneath a tree, an apple falls on his head  
My my time flies a man wrote a symphony, it's 1812  
  
My! My! Time flies! Four guys across abbey road, one forgot to wear shoes  
My! My! Time flies! A rap on a rhapsody, a king who's still in the news, a
king to sing you the blues  
  
My! My! Time flies! A man in a winter sleigh, white white white as the snow  
My! My! Time flies! A new day is on its way, so let's let yesterday go  
Could be we step out again  
Could be tomorrow but then,  
Could be 2010
