(Verse)  
My mind runs away to you  
With a thought I hope you'll see  
Can't see where it's wandered to  
But I know where it wants to be  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
I'm waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
(Chorus)  
That you're the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know you're out there  
We're meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
  
(Verse)  
So sick of this loneliness  
It seems such a waste of breath  
So much that I need to say  
So much to get off my chest  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
I'm waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
(Chorus)  
That you're the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know you're out there  
We're meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
And make it to me  
Make it to me
