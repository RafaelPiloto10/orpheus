Come on in, have a look around  
Hang your hat and find a chair  
The pretty women smile at you  
The party's just beginning  
There's music everywhere  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Brothers got to stick together here  
Fight with one, you fight with three  
The family blood is thick as mud  
Day to day the world keeps spinning  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
It reminds you of who you used to be  
And who you are, and who you'll always be  
It finds you in pursuit of dreams  
And hopeless schemes  
Life is richer than it seems  
Nothing like being in a woman's arms  
The one you love, the one you want  
There's one small problem, who can she be  
I feel like winning her in paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
I'm gonna take you there  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
I'm gonna take you there  
Take you to the paradise
