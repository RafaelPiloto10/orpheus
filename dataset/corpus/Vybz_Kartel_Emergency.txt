Emergency, we a suffer roun ere  
Roun ere, man a ded, tings tougher roun ere  
Crime scene gone up, tall up man ah go fa roun ere  
Missa man, whe yu doing fi the gutter roun ere?  
  
Two party, but ah de same sad song dem a play  
Poor people money lean back and rockaway  
Dem raise everyting from oil to Craven A  
So how dem no raise up everybody pay  
Portmore mi born and ah de so mi yard stay  
So mi nah pay no toll fi cross the Causeway  
Mr. Bruce, Mr. PJ  
This is just a couple question from Addi the deejay  
  
Kingston mek no AK?  
How gun come inna JA?  
Who own the wharf and the airport, the docks and the bay?  
  
Emergency, we a suffer roun ere  
Roun ere, man a ded, tings tougher roun ere  
Crime scene gone up, tall up man ah go fa roun ere  
Missa man, whe yu doing fi the gutter roun ere?  
  
Everyting except ded people ah raise  
De dead man ah 'sehe' him betta off inna the grave  
How we fi save pon minimum wage  
When two yute go high school, two go all age?  
Dem change dem face like Nicholas Cage  
True election ah come, dem temporary re-arrange  
Mi rate Bruce, mi rate PJ  
But dem waan we ded off like dog weh have mange  
Mi born a sufferer, when it ah go change?  
Mi love Portia Simpson, mi love Babsy Grange  
But if dem nuh tun a new page  
We nah wear no red or no green again  
We ah wear beige  
Fi de yute dem a de stoplight, mi a beg oonu a change  
Oonu dog a live betta dan dem, oonu outrage  
Yu know how much innocent yute dem a hundred man inna de cage  
  
Emergency, we a suffer roun ere  
Roun ere, man a ded, tings tougher roun ere  
Crime scene gone up, tall up man ah go fa roun ere  
Missa man, whe yu doing fi the gutter roun ere?
