Ladies and Gentlemen we've got a special treat for tonight  
I'm gonna call my friend Olly up here to sing to you ladies  
Olly!  
Yeah!  
Let's go man  
Okay  
  
My name is Olly nice to meet you can I tell you baby  
Look around there's a whole lot of pretty ladies  
But not like you, you shine so bright, yeah  
  
I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute  
On the floor up and close getting lost in it  
I won't give up without a fight  
  
I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
  
We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now  
Loosen up and let you hands go down, down  
Go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah  
  
I feel the music moving through your body  
Looking at you I can tell you want me  
Don't stop keep moving till the morning light, yeah  
  
When I saw you there, sitting all alone in the dark acting like you didn't
have a care  
I knew right then, you'd be mine, we'd be dancing the whole damn night, like  
Oh baby, I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
  
Break it down now, shake it like that, now bring it all back  
To dance with me tonight  
One more time, one more time, come on now  
Do your thing, everybody sing  
I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight
