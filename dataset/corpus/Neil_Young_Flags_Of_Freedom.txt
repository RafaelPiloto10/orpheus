Today's the day our younger son  
Is goin' off to war  
Fightin' in the age old battle  
We've sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin' in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Church bells are ringin'  
As the families stand and wave  
Some of them are cryin'  
But the soldiers look so brave  
Lookin' straight ahead  
Like they know just where they're goin'  
Past the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Sister has her headphones on  
She hears the music blasting  
She sees here brother marchin' by  
Their bond is everlasting  
Listening to Bob Dylan singin'  
In 1963  
Watchin' the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
She sees the president speakin'  
On a flat-screen TV  
In the window of the old appliance store  
She turns to see her brother again  
But he's already walkin' past  
The flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Have you seen the flags of freedom?  
What color are they now?  
Do you think that you believe in yours  
More than they do theirs somehow?  
When you see the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Todays' the day our younger son  
Is goin' off to war  
Fighting in the age old battle  
We've sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin' in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'
