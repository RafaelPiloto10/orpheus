Sight  
Pale riders into the night.  
Galloping up harder, faster (faster)  
Through your dreaming wake  
Walk through the fire innate  
Frost bitten soul in a zero (zero)  
Excitation  
  
Are you remembering the sound?  
Recall the shaking of the ground.  
Calling, calling all as one,  
Lords of Summer bring the sun.  
Coming, coming winter's yearn,  
Lords of Summer shall return.  
  
Eternal thawing has begun  
Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winter's turn.  
For soon the Lords of Summer shall return,  
Lords of Summer shall return.  
  
Straight  
Light passes through, penetrate.  
It's been a long lonely winter (winter)  
Illumination bright  
Fading the volume and light  
Reanimated by fire (fire)  
Transformation  
  
Become the nexus of the sound.  
Become the shaking of the ground.  
Calling, calling all as one,  
Lords of summer bring the sun.  
Coming, coming winter's yearn,  
Lords of summer have returned.  
  
Eternal thawing has begun  
Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winter's turn  
Now that the Lords of Summer have returned,  
Lords of Summer have returned.  
  
Calling, calling all as one

Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winter's turn  
Now that the Lords of Summer have returned,  
Lords of Summer have returned.
