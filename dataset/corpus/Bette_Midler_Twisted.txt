"How ya doin' girls? Long time, no see.  
Listen, I've been to the doctor lately.  
Honey, I just spent forty dollars to hear that from that guy?"  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
The way he described it he said,  
"You'd be better off dead than alive."  
I didn't listen to his jive.  
I knew all along he was all wrong,  
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,  
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
He said I need treatment.  
But I'm not that easily led.  
He said I was the type that was most inclined  
When out of his sight  
To be out of my mind.  
And he thought I was nuts.  
No more if's or and's or but's.  
Oh, no.  
  
They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild  
With all my crazy ideas.  
But I knew what was happenin',  
I knew I was a genius.  
What's so strange when you know that  
You're a wizard at three?  
I said, "Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me."  
  
I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.  
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.  
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.  
But I had saw some crazy things  
Before I came to.  
Now, do you think I was crazy?  
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.  
  
They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,  
They all laughed at Edison,  
And also at Einstein.  
So why should I feel sorry if they just  
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic  
That went on in my head.  
I had a brain, it was insane.  
So I just let them laugh at me  
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses  
All because there was no driver on the top.  
Aaaaaaah.  
  
"Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?  
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?  
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?"  
Ba, ba, ba, ba!  
"Oh, here she comes again."  
Badada, badada, badada. Wo!  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
But I said, "Doctor,  
I think that it's you instead.  
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,  
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.  
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.  
And you know two heads are better than one."  
  
"Honey, she is twisted"
