If you could read my mind love,  
What a tale my thoughts could tell.  
Just like an old time movie,  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet.  
You know that ghost is me.  
And I will never be set free,  
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.  
  
If I could read your mind love,  
What a tale your thoughts could tell.  
Just like a paperback novel,  
The kind the drugstores sell.  
When you reach the part where the heartaches come,  
the hero would be me.  
Heroes often fail.  
And you won't read that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take.  
  
I walk away like a movie star  
Who gets burned in a three way script.  
Enter number two,  
A movie queen to play the scene  
Of bringing all the good things out in me,  
But for now love lets be real.  
  
I never thought I could act this way  
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back.  
  
If you could read my mind love,  
What a tale my thoughts could tell.  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet,  
The story always ends.  
If you read between the lines  
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand  
The feeling that you LACK.  
  
I never thought I could feel this way  
And I got to say that I just don't get it.  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone  
And I just can't get it back.
