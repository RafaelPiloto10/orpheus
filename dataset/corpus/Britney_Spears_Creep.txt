CREEP  
  
God I'm such a creep  
I'm having so much fun breaking up  
It's getting kind of wicked  
  
And there's no need to weep  
It's more like a relief - I can't stop  
Laughing and I'm thinking  
You're looking at a single in gold  
  
I'm just your worst freakin'nightmare girlfriend  
  
I am such a creep  
I am such a creepy kind  
Sorry but I do believe I'm just that type of girl  
I am such a creep  
( and I can't help it )  
I aint gonna waste my time  
And I do believe that boy just had to go  
God I'm such a creep!  
  
The grass is turning green  
The air is loosing weight - and the sun  
Is lighting up my bedroom  
  
My smile is kinda mean  
I feel like I'm a dove with a gun  
I'm looking in my phonebook  
And there's a lot of numbers to dial  
  
.....God I'm such a creep  
I'm having so much fun breaking up  
I'm laughin and I'm thinking  
You're looking at a single in gold
