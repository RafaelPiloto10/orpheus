You have been a healer, makin' me well  
You have been my talker, givin' my ego hell  
You came and settled me down, when my lights were so dim  
You made me go on when I felt like givin' in  
  
You have been my fire to warm this heart of stone  
You stopped me from feelin' lost and on my own  
You must have been through college, got a lovin' degree  
You ripped away my mental chains and set this poor boy free  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
Your are a powerhouse of love  
  
When I was in pain, lyin' in my troubled bed  
You would be my jester, makin' me laugh instead  
You've been my guiding light and you have turned the switch on  
You made me see positive when my whole damn world went wrong  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
You are a powerhouse of love
