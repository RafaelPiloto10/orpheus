n the road to nowhere, every day was just the same  
So I took my belongings, and hitchhiked no more to blame  
To California, in the warm Summer of love  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
I came to a crossroad, where a stranger gazed and spoke  
He was looking kinda peculiar,  
In a purple colored cloak  
He wore a token, never seen before  
He said: All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
Sunset in Southern California  
and the morning seems so far so far away  
Sunset in Southern California  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
  
I came to his temple at noon the second day  
It was a lot of mumbling, in the shadows did they pray  
Feeling kind of dizzy, a gong struck and people chanted  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then a kind of leader, appeared in fume and smoke  
All dressed in silver,  
An authoritarian bloke  
He turned around and talked to me  
With a demagogic voice  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego
