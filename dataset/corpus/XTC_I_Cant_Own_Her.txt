And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
  
I own this river, I own this town  
All of its climbers and its wino's sliding down  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
'Til the gutter shines like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
I've got all morning, I've got all year  
It's down in my pocket with the daylight folded there  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
How I'd wash her hair like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
And when I say I can't own her  
I don't mean to buy her  
It's nothing at all to do with money  
I simply want her in my arms forever more.  
Is that an odd request?  
Is that something so funny?  
  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
Yes there's more chance of that coming true  
  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
So I can't own her (Of all the things you've got the thing you want the most
is her)  
And I never will (And she's the one thing that you just can't have)  
No I can't own her (Of all the things you've got the thing you want the most
is her)  
And that's a bitter pill (And she's the one thing that you just can't have)  
  
Taken with rain  
Which I swallow down with the swirling sky  
With the swirling sky  
  
But I can't own her  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
No I can't own her  
Yes there's more chance of that coming true
