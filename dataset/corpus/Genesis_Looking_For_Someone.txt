Looking for someone,  
I guess I'm doing that  
Trying to find a memory in a dark room  
Dirty man, you're looking like a Buddha, I know you well  
Yeah  
  
Keep on a straight line  
I don't believe I can,  
Trying to find a needle in a haystack,  
Chilly wind you're piercing like a dagger, it hurts me so.  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me, I'm back again.  
You see the sunlight through the trees, to keep you warm  
in peaceful shades of green  
Yet in the darkness of my mind  
Damascus wasn't far behind.  
  
Lost in a subway,  
I guess I'm losing time.  
There's a man looking at a magazine  
You're such a fool, your mumbo-jumbo never tells me anything  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me I'm back again  
You feel the ashes from the fire that kept you warm  
its comfort disappears  
And still the only friend I know  
Will never tell me where I go  
  
Looking for someone and now I've found myself a name  
Come away, leave me, all that I have I will give  
Leave me, leave me, all that I am I will give
