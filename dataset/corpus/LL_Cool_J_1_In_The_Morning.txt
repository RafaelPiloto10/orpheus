It's one in the mornin',  
You know what time it is!  
It's one in the mornin'  
It's one in the mornin',  
You gonna have come out your clothes on this one  
It's one in the mornin'  
  
Yeah I'm still at it, the microphone addict  
You get your dome splattered, 'cause homey will not have it  
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic  
For actin' like you a teenage chick with her bra padded  
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge  
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin' through they cabbage  
You know my track record, L battle like a savage  
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage  
Uncle LL, I got product for sale  
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail  
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community  
Gotta get this money while y'all march for unity  
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on  
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on  
The realest brother, you Nicole Kidman, one of 'The Others'  
Children shiverin' under the covers  
The man in black, the tilted Fedora hat  
I'm bringin' it raw, you never want your money back  
I'm focused baby, livin' like a quarterback  
Playin' in the wishbone, L keep options black  
Systematically, burn you like calories  
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary  
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees  
You could catch it like the flu, homey follow me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough  
It's one in the mornin', crack the Mo'  
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'  
It's one in the mornin', who want to go?  
  
That's right Sleeping Beauty, wake up see the light  
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM  
Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin' coliseums  
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin' for per diem  
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum  
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him  
Money's my slave, it do what I say  
It cry for me, like Denzel in "Glory"  
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty  
I wonder if you hatin' on the low, probably!  
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels  
Damn! Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal  
But you lack the discipline to do what I do  
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension  
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot  
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye yo E it's one o'clock  
Time to get one and bounce baby  
It's time to get one and bounce,  
You know what time it is  
  
Your honor, last week he punched me in my face  
I want twenty million, you know he liftin' weights  
Last week, me and the President was takin' flicks  
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick  
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks  
That cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it  
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted  
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Sumit  
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know  
My po'tfolio was sicker than polio  
For real God is good, he took me out the hood  
Got me livin' in a mansion like a big boy should  
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes  
Knowin' how I live, bed extra big  
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch  
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out  
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce  
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce  
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo  
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago  
But no, in real life cats catch it  
It's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah yeah  
It's the definition  
Definition  
Definition potna, eleven in a row!
