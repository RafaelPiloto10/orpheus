I don't care if you wreck my car or shave off all my hair  
You can go and run your vacuum during my favorite show  
And I'll let you call up folks in Europe you don't even know  
Anything you want, babe, if it makes you happy  
But I'm begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh, honey, please don't wear those shoes  
You can spend my money, you can waste my time  
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes  
Don't wear those shoes  
It's alright, you can play your twisted sister every night  
I suppose, you can lick the middles out of my oreos  
Or start laughing while you're drinking milk so it comes out your nose  
And you know that I'd do anything to please you  
But I'm begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh, honey, please don't wear those shoes  
You can spit in my face in you're so inclined  
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes  
Oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, please don't wear those  
Use my razor to shave your legs or eat crackers in bed  
Stomp the poodle 'til it's flat  
You can even shove a six-inch railroad spike through my head  
I can learn to live with that  
But now I'm begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh, honey, please, don't wear those shoes  
You can whip me, beat me, rob me blind  
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those  
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
You can scratch up my records, you can drink my booze  
But baby, please don't wear those shoes  
You can make me an offer I can't refuse  
But darling, please don't wear those shoes  
You can play your bongos while I'm trying to snooze  
But honey, please don't wear those shoes  
You can expose yourself on the six o' clock news  
But please, please don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe  
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe  
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes  
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe  
...
