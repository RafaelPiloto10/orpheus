A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for Where The Wild Roses
Grow. Nick's song is also available.  
  
When I was a wee thing, I heard my mother say  
That I was meant for rambling and would easy go astray  
And before that I would work, I would rather sport and play  
With my Johnny on the banks of red roses  
  
  
On the banks of red roses, my love and I sat down  
He took out his tuning box to play his love a tune  
In the middle of the tune, his love got up and cried  
Oh Johnny, lovely Johnny, would you leave me?  
  
  
So they walked and they talked until they came upon a cave  
Where the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave  
Aye, the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave  
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of red roses  
  
  
Oh no, oh no, cried she, that grave's not meant for me  
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be  
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be  
And he's made her to lie down on red roses  
  
  
And all on his way homeward, his heart was filled with fear  
Every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear  
Yes, every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear  
Who he made to lie down on red roses
