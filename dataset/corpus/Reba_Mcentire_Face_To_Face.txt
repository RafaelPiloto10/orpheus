Oh you don't have blue eyes  
I expected blue eyes  
That's how I pictured you would be  
  
And you don't have long hair  
I thought that you'd have long hair  
So this is all a shock to me  
  
I didn't know if you would meet me or believe me  
When I said that I was fooled  
I really thought that I would hate you  
I know I meant to  
There'd only be one of us left when we're through  
  
Now that we're face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see who's really to blame  
  
And I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
  
I believe in true love something to be sure of  
Isn't that what we deserve?  
There is no blame here, we both end up the same here  
A little wiser than we were  
  
There was a time this would have killed me  
And it may still be hard to look you in the eye  
And now that all the spells are broken  
The truth's been spoken  
My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye  
  
And now that we're face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see who's really to blame  
  
And I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
  
I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
Now that we're face to face
