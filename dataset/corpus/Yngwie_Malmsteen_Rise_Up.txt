You know I have seen the dark side  
But evil is not my friend  
And you know I'll die trying  
Keep on trying to the end  
You know I'm superstitious  
But the devil never pays  
My victory is delicious  
When you fall, fall from grace  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise  
Rise up  
I have had my share of fighting  
But I still could fight some more  
Now I can see the horizon  
Much better than before  
What I've been giving all these years  
My blood, my sweat, my tears  
I'll carry on forever  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise up  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
What I've been giving all these years  
My blood, my sweat, my tears  
I'll carry on forever  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise
