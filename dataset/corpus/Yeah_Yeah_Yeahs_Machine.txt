Wasteful season take my hand  
Take the place of the snakes who ran  
  
Savage things wash over me  
A crime that leaves the heated green  
  
Oh machine  
Machine, I washed it for you  
Oh machine  
Machine, I wasted for you  
  
And I walk, and I walk  
The space left for two  
And I wait, and I wait  
To wake next to you  
And I walk, and I walk  
The space left for two  
And I wait, and I wait  
To wake next to you  
  
Oh machine  
Machine, I wasted for you  
  
Machine, machine  
I washed it for you
