It's not the way that you say "Adieu" that  
Leaves behind you a smilin' fool, It's that  
I know you're a song come true,baby I love  
You,and I'll follow you till the ends meet..  
  
And it's the way that you touch my hand that  
Lets me know you will understand, 'cause I've  
Been feelin' it in the land, baby, I'm near  
You, and I'll follow you till I'm six deep,..  
  
It's not the way that you say "Adieu" that  
Leaves behind you a smilin' fool it's that I  
Know you're a song come true, baby I love you,  
And I'll follow you till the ends meet.
