My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac  
  
She looked better than gold like she was dear  
You know she changed her name got one small kid  
My baby came back in a Big Black (Black) Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac It seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac I'm sure he miss my touch I never really missed him much  
  
She's digging for gold it's what she doing  
I got to be older than a ruin  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac, Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac it seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac I'm sure he miss my touch I never really missed him much  
Black Cadillac, oh oh yeah he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I
came back  
Black Cadillac I know he miss my touch I never really really missed him  
  
Someday I sit and share my brand new song with you everywhere (everywhere)  
There's this something hanging in the air a sticky love affair bubble gum in
my hair  
  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac it seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac I'm sure he miss my touch I never really really missed him much  
Black Cadillac the things that went too far arriving in the car (Oh he'll be
sold)  
Black Cadillac I'm sure he miss my touch I never really really missed him much  
  
Black Cadillac, oh baby, oh  
Black Cadillac, I never missed him much  
Black black Cadillac
