Day into night she's with me  
How sweet is her warm embrace  
Safe in the scent of jasmine  
So safe in her gold and lace  
  
Mornings I find, she's left me  
So cold so alone, but aware  
I try to escape, she finds me  
Oh run though I may, she's there, there, there, there, there  
  
Luck is a lady whose smile is as cold as a stone  
She'll bring you things, many things you might never have known  
But when your die is cast she'll have the final laugh at you  
She'll lock you in a duel, where you come out the fool  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death  
  
Day into night she's with me  
Turn of a card, she's there  
The first time is free, you know  
But from now on, pay me, me, me, me, me  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death
