Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
She lived across the street on the fifteenth floor of the Gilmore building  
I saw her in the shower reaching for some soap  
I knew she had to be the girl for me  
And to think I probably never would have found her  
If I hadn't bought that telescope  
  
Oh, me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I just can't understand it  
Why won't you return my phone calls  
Are you still mad I gave a Mohawk to your cat  
If you'd just say the word  
I'm certain that our love would last forever and ever  
Or are you too dumb to realize that  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
How can you ignore me when you know that I can't live without you  
I have to go through your garbage just to learn more about you  
  
Melanie, ooh  
Oh sweet me-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
You weren't impressed when I tattooed your name across my forehead  
You wouldn't listen when I promised to be true  
I couldn't stand it so I jumped out from the sixteenth story window  
Right above you  
Now I may be dead but I still love you  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet, sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me
