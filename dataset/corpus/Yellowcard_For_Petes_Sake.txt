So I'm left wondering  
there is so much left I wish that I could say to you  
Silence I keep  
For fear of breaking myself down and maybe getting through  
getting through to you  
  
For Pete's Sake  
Let's see straight  
Clench your fists up in rage  
Hurts to know  
We could throw  
All this time away  
  
Let's try and work it out  
Please don't be angry anymore I'm on your side  
I don't want to fight  
Put this hate aside  
Get back to a place where you and I can still be friends  
  
You want it, you need it  
And all the answers you're racing to find out  
They might outrun you in the end
