Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
From just this side of midnight  
'Til dawn breaks into daylight  
Keepin' myself out of sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
Well I've heard this story before  
But that doesn't stop me searching  
It's been so long since you gave me a sign  
A sign to stop my head turning  
But all I have are just your old memories  
But you know baby, baby that's fine  
'Cause I'm spending all of my time  
  
Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
From just this side of midnight  
'til dawn breaks into daylight  
Keepin' myself out of sight  
Searching for green light  
Lookin' around  
  
But all I have are your old memories  
But you know baby baby that's fine  
'Cause I'm spending all of my time  
  
Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
Searching for a green light  
From just this of midnight etc....
