You've got the cool water  
When the river runs high  
And you've got the look of love  
Right in your eyes  
And I was in a crazy motion  
Till you calmed me down  
It took a little time  
But you calmed me down  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
But like a child They're longing to be told  
They've got a wall in China  
It's a thousand miles long  
To keep out the foreigners  
They made it strong  
And I've got a wall around me  
That you can't even see  
It took a little time  
To get next to me  
If something goes wrong  
I'm the first to admit it  
The first to admit it  
But the last one to know  
If something goes right  
Well,it's likely to lose me  
It's apt to confuse me  
Because it's such an unusual sight  
Oh I can't get used to something so right  
Something so right  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
But like a child I'm longing to be told  
They've got a wall in China  
And I've got a wall around me  
It took a little time  
To get next to me
