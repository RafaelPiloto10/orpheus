It must be you  
Makin' me feel things I can't explain  
For some reason I'm just laughin' at the rain  
I can't believe  
Who I am has changed so suddenly  
I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do  
This is not like me  
It must be you  
  
It must be love  
Nothin' else could turn me upside down  
Or plant my feet so firmly on the ground  
What's happening  
Everything I say I want to sing  
Everything I've dreamed is coming true  
What's this feeling in my heart  
It must be you  
  
Hold me now like this forever  
And let this moment go on endlessly  
?Cause I'm alive when you're beside me  
That's how I know we're how it's supposed to be
