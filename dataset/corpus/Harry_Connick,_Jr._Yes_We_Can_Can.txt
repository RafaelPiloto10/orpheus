Now is the time for all good men to get together with one another  
Iron out the problems and iron out their quarrels  
And try to live as brothers  
Try to find the peace within without stepping on one another  
Do respect the women of the world, just remember we all had mothers  
  
Make this land a better land  
Than the world in which we live  
And help each man be a better man  
With the kindness that we give  
  
I know we can make it, I know darn well we can work it out  
Yes, we can, I know we can can  
Yes, we can, can, why can't we? If we wanna, yes, we can, can  
I know we can make it work, I know we can make it, try  
Yes, we can, I know we can can, yes we can make lot of money  
Yes, we can, I know we can can  
  
Take care of all the children, the children of the world  
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future  
The little bitty boys and girls  
  
Make this land a better land  
Than the world in which we live  
And help each man be a better man  
With the kindness that we give  
  
I know we can make it, I know darn well we can work it out  
Yes, we can, I know we can can  
Yes, we can, can, why can't we? If we wanna, yes, we can, can  
I know we can make it work, I know we can make it if we try  
Yes, we can, I know we can can, yes we can make lot of money  
Yes, we can, I know we can can
