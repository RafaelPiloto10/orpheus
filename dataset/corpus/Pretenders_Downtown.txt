Get to the heart  
Baby, the heart of the city  
Meet me in a fire fight  
Of lusty boys in candlelight  
Beat to the heart, baby the heart of the city  
Veins pop and cry for more  
And lick it off the killing floor  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!  
  
Move to the beat. Baby the beat of the city  
Rubber glove me when you love me  
Promise me protection  
Dance to the heat, baby the heat of the city  
Glorify my oozing head  
And raise me from the living dead  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!  
  
Downtown me - baby strip me  
Chop me, adopt me, bend me like a rubber dolly  
Downtown me - demolition me  
Raise me, appraise me, the portage hotel and me  
Downtown me - with a lobotomy  
Take me to the cuyahoga valley and make a man of me  
  
Get to the heart, baby the heart of the city  
Say you love it when you shove it  
Don't be sentimental  
Move to the heart, baby - the heart of the city  
This is where the future lies  
Beneath the burning sulphur skies  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!
