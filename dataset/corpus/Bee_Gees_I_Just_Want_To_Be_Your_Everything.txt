For so long  
You and me been finding each other for so long  
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl  
Take it from me  
If you give a little more than you're asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
Darling mine  
I would wait forever for those lips of wine  
Build my world around you, darling  
This love will shine girl  
Watch it and see  
If you give a little more than you're asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
  
I, I just want to be your everything  
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be  
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string  
Oh baby mine, if I'd stay here without you, darlin', I would die.  
I want you laying in the love I have to bring  
I'd do anything to be your ev'rything
