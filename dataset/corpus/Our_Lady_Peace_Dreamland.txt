A mother sets the dinner table  
Son crashes to the pavement, yeah  
A father workin' just to make ends  
We spend our lives to try and make sense, of it.  
  
But I, I feel the love, I feel the power  
It comes to me in the darkest hour  
And I, I wanna feel it again.  
  
In this dreamland the kids are alright,  
And the sky is blue.  
We all got wings,  
And know how to fly.  
I made it to the moon.  
  
The sun on my face,  
My head in the clouds.  
Time on my side,  
My feet off the ground,  
I'm not comin' down.  
  
The summer ends, the ocean dries up  
A stranger dies and no one gives a fuck  
I take a look over my shoulder  
All my friends have gotten older, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
But I, I feel the love, I feel the power  
It comes to me in the darkest hour  
And I, I wanna feel it again.  
  
In this dreamland the kids are alright,  
And the sky is blue.  
We all got wings,  
And know how to fly.  
I made it to the moon.  
  
The sun on my face,  
My head in the clouds,  
Time on my side,  
My feet off the ground.  
I'm not comin' down.  
  
I'm not gonna  
Change just to change,  
Break just to break,  
Blame just to blame,  
  
My head in the clouds,  
Feet off the ground,  
I'm not comin' down.  
  
In this dreamland the kids are alright  
And the sky is blue.  
We all got wings,  
And know how to fly.  
I made it to the moon.  
  
The sun on my face,  
My head in the clouds,  
Time on my side,  
My feet off the ground.  
I'm not comin' down.  
I'm not comin' down.  
I'm not comin' down.  
I'm not comin' down.
