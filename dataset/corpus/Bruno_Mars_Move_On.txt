(Whooo whoooo)  
How do I end up in the same old place,  
Faced again with the same mistakes,  
So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,  
But life proves me wrong everytime,  
Takin roads that lead me nowhere,  
How do I expect to get there,  
But when will I learn to just put you first.  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on. Can I move on.  
(Oh)  
When I awake it's you that makes  
Me strong,  
And I know that you've been with me all along,  
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,  
With you life is so easy why do I  
Make it hard,  
Oh takin' roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.  
(Hey!)  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on.  
I get out of my own way, let you have your way.  
Cause I realize I'm no god on my own,  
I'm there for you, I'll sell for you  
I can't live without you.  
Noooo...  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
Why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong,  
I was wrong, I was wrong.  
With only you, only you,  
With only you.  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on.
