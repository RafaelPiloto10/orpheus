I've spent all of my time on the road  
Sleeping my days away but you should know  
That I'm reflecting on who I've let go  
The people I've hurt in ways I'll never know  
And I never meant to be hurtful to you  
Please don't hate me  
All I can say I did, All I could do  
Please don't hate me for this  
I've spent all of my nights wide awake  
Wishing for some kind of poison to take  
So that my conscience would just take a break  
I am so tired of the noise that it makes  
I'm guilty enough without hearing it twice  
Please don't hate me  
You won't give it up but it's all in your eyes  
Please don't hate me for this  
I've spent every second I've had  
Counting the minutes and I'm going mad  
I am redefining the words I am sad  
Nothing I've done ever hurt quite this bad  
And I'm sure that I will heal faster than you  
Please don't hate me  
I don't expect you to know what to do  
Please don't hate me  
When we're old men we will not be alone  
Not be alone anymore (Not be alone)  
When we're old men we will not be alone  
Not be alone anymore (Not be alone)
