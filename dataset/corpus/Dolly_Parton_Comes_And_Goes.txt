(Porter Wagoner)  
Now and then, here and there, I still see you  
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low  
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go  
At times, my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado wind  
As it comes and goes  
Well, look who's here  
I told myself that you'd be coming soon  
I hope that you can stay for a little while  
It's so lonesome in this room  
And you look just the same today  
Do you still love me so?  
What's that you say, you can't stay?  
You seem to come and go  
At times my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado winds  
As it comes and goes
