Chorus:  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you,  
I'm just a love machine,  
A huggin', kissin' friend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow - wooo  
  
Chorus  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while - ooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
Chorus
