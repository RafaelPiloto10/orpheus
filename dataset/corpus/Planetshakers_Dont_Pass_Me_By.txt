My heart it longs, my soul it thirst for more,  
For more of you.  
I'm reaching out, I'm waiting here for more,  
For more of you.  
  
Cause all I want is you,  
All I need is to be here with you.  
  
I'm hungry for Your fire,  
I'm desperate, You're my one desire  
Jesus, please don't pass me by  
  
I need You, more than ever,  
I'm thirsty, for a touch from Heaven  
Jesus, please don't pass me by.....
