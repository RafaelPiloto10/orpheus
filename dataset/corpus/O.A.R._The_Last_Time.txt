Under this sun that's fit for a king  
I'm up against the rock  
I could have been anywhere else in the world  
I'm holding down this spot  
Nothing came close  
And nothing looked good  
I'm out there on the edge  
On the toe of it all  
A castle keeps an eye on the bay  
Under sheets of haze  
  
Somewhere down there with the crashing waves  
You kept plans for your grand escape  
And I won't see you no more  
You'll just hear me  
  
'Cause I will scream  
Send it out to sea  
I will live a mile beyond  
A mile beyond that heart of yours  
Is broken, ain't it torn  
So you will leave for the last time  
For the last time  
  
She set out one night for a place she'd never been  
Oh sweet, my love  
How does it end?  
Did you find another house in the sun?  
Did you fall in love?  
You set sail  
But did not fail me  
Are you coming back again?  
Or have you run like I did?  
It's the last time you're gonna do it again  
  
It's in your blood just to say goodbye  
This time not for a while  
So find your heaven, go on  
You don't need me  
  
So I will scream  
Send it out to sea  
And I will live a mile beyond  
A mile beyond that heart of yours  
Broken, ain't it torn  
So you will leave for the last time  
For the last time  
  
Coming to you in the middle of a cold night  
Can't arrest the sun but I've been trying  
I hear a song floating off a tidal wave  
It's alright, it's alright  
Nothing gonna touch you when you've said goodbye  
It's alright, it's alright  
A million lost souls looking just like me  
Waiting on their love but they don't believe  
  
There's a million lost souls looking just like me  
Waiting on permission but they don't believe  
  
I will scream  
And send it out to sea  
Somewhere between the rock face  
And the place that I used to know you more  
Waiting on the shore  
As you leave for the last time  
I will see you leave for the last time  
Until I breathe for the last time  
And then I will leave for the last time
