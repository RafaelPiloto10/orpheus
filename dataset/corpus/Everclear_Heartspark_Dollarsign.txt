Time stops when the whispers blare  
The voices drop hard but the eyes still stare  
The world resolves into a death's head grin  
Because I walk with pride  
With a black girlfriend  
My mom said not to bring her around  
Cause she's black  
My Family would put her down  
I'll break the white trash ties that bind  
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind  
She said she said  
Forget the fact that I don't  
Look like you  
She said, she said  
You're possessed with a power  
Bigger than the pain  
Time stops when we lie so close  
In my room where we share  
What no one knows  
From the day that we start  
Until the day that we end  
I know I know I know now  
We will never find a place  
Where we could just fit in  
Me and my black girlfriend  
She said- she said  
Fend for yourself, you're alone  
She said, she said  
You are possessed with a power  
Bigger than the pain  
A power bigger than the pain
