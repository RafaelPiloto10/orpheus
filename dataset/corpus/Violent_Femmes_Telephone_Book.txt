I look at my telephone book  
I look at my telephone book  
I can't stand the way it look  
I hate to think the way you took  
Me down into a burnin' rage  
I wrote your name on every page  
But you don't return my calls  
You don't return my calls  
You don't return my calls  
I'm ready to bust down the walls  
I'm going down Niagara Falls  
In a barrel of fun  
Hey ain't I a lucky one  
You don't return my calls  
My telephone book is the color red  
My telephone book is the color red  
The red is all in my head  
Some things are left better unsaid  
Is that why you don't try  
To acknowledge or reply  
You don't return my calls  
Why did you hear from an old friend  
I knew once way back when  
I did some bad things to myself and my health  
Or did you happen to hear an old song I once sang  
Did it make your sweet sweet blood run cold in your veins  
And will you never think of me the same
