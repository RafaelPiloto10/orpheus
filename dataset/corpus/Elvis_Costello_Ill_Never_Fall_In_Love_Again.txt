What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a girl  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, she'll never phone you  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you give your heart  
You get it all broken up and battered  
That's what you get, a heart that's shattered  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again
