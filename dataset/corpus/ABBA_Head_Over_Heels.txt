I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
(She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
And she goes  
Head over heels
