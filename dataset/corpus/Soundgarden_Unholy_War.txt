From the start of life  
To your dying day  
In the dark of night  
And in the burning light of day  
  
It's a bloody fight  
And you can't walk away  
There's no rest in sight  
And I struggle just to slave  
  
I'm tired of living on the front line  
Of this  
  
[Chorus]  
Unholy war, unholy war  
We try, we fight, until we die  
Unholy war, unholy war  
You see, you know, you'll always be  
Unholy  
  
I see your burning fuse  
From a mile away  
You take the world's abuse  
Then you bow your head in shame  
  
You gotta learn to bite the hand  
That pulls your chain  
There's too much sanity  
It will make you go insane  
  
I'll fight when we're all on the same side  
Of this  
Unholy war, unholy war  
We try to fight until we die  
  
Unholy  
When you're all alone - Unholy  
With your thoughts of pain - Unholy  
You're a burning fuse - Unholy  
  
Can you break the strings? - Unholy  
You're shaking in your boots  
You met your end today (?)  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll see we've all got hell to pay  
And we got battle wounds  
In the lion's cage  
We'll all be W's  
  
Beneath the numbers on the page (?)  
As we cry 'til the battle is over
