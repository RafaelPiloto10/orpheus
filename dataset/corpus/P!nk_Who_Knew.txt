[Verse 1]  
You took my hand, you showed me how,  
You promised me you'd be around,  
Uh huh, that's right.  
I took your words and I believed  
In everything you said to me,  
Yeah huh, that's right  
  
[Chorus:]  
If someone said three years from now,  
You'd be long gone,  
I'd stand up and punch them out,  
Cause they're all wrong.  
I know better,  
'Cause you said forever, and ever,  
Who knew  
  
[Verse 2]  
Remember when we were such fools,  
And so convinced and just too cool,  
Oh no, no, no.  
I wish I could touch you again,  
I wish I could still call you a friend,  
I'd give anything.  
  
[Chorus:]  
When someone said count your blessings now,  
For they're long gone,  
I guess I just didn't know how,  
I was all wrong.  
They knew better,  
Still you said forever, and ever,  
Who knew.  
  
[Bridge]  
Yeah yeah,  
I'll keep you locked in my head,  
Until we meet again.  
Until we, until we meet again,  
And I won't forget you, my friend,  
What happened.  
  
[Chorus:]  
If someone said three years from now,  
You'd be long gone,  
I'd stand up and punch them out,  
Cause they're all wrong and.  
And that last kiss, I'll cherish,  
Until we meet again.  
And time makes, it harder,  
I wish I could remember!  
But I keep, your memory,  
You visit me in my sleep.  
My darling,  
Who knew?  
  
[Outro]  
My darling, my darling,  
Who knew?  
My darling, I miss you,  
My Darling,  
Who knew?  
Who knew?
