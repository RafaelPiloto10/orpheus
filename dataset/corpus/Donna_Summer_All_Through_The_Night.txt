You know, boy  
You're so busy reaching for a dream  
That doesn't even exist  
You can't even see someone  
Who's standing right here  
Who loves you so much  
And I've tried  
Oh I've tried  
But I want you to still know this  
That all you got to do is reach out for me  
And I'll be there  
Anytime you want me  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
Quit searchin'  
Anticipatin'  
Stop reachin'  
For that distant star  
  
I been waiting  
Boy don't pass the moment  
The light's right before your very eyes  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And if you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
Quit dreamin'  
You're so mistaken  
A perfect stranger  
Will never call  
  
Stop wishin'  
If you want let good be  
Me waiting at your door  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And if you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And if you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
Stop searchin' boy  
Stop searchin'  
Stop searchin', yeah  
Stop searchin', oh yeah  
Why don't you stop it  
Quit searchin', anticipatin'  
Stop reachin'  
For that distant star  
I've been waitin'  
Boy don't pass the moment  
The lights right before your very eyes  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And if you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
All through the night  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
You can make love to my mind  
And if you feel the magic  
Don't be afraid  
  
Stop searchin'  
Stop searchin'  
Stop searchin'  
Stop searchin'  
Stop searchin'  
Cause I'm right here
