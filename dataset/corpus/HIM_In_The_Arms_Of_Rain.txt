Once again we found ourselves to be lost  
Holding hands while straying from the path in the forest dark  
Aren't you happy to see me crawl serpentine towards the sun to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Lift the lid of your heart's casket in the arms of rain  
We'll drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain  
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secrets you've kept from me  
Hail Marys for tomorrow's dream  
In the arms of rain we are free  
  
Again, I fought myself and lost  
Come bite the apple and I'll coil around your heart  
I'm so happy to see you weep along  
In these arms you belong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ave Maria we've tried  
Ave Maria we've cried  
Ave Maria we've died  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's the end of a road, hold me  
It's the end of a road and we're free
