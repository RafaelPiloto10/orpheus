You know you light my candle  
You knew you load my gun  
You're way too hot to handle  
There's nothing we ain't done  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Give it to me  
  
Mouth full of hot persuasion  
You face me upside down  
A love for all occasions  
You won't catch me foolin' around  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I can't, can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Oh, I need to know you're near me  
I need you by my side  
You keep my tank on empty  
You keep me up all night  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Oh no, can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Give me your hot persuasion  
I can't get enough, get enough  
I've done hot persuasion
