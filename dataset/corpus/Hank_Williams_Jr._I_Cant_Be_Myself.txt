It's the way of mine to say just what I'm thinking  
And to do the things I really want to do  
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of  
So I can't be myself when I'm with you  
Oh you never like the clothes I wear on Sunday  
  
Just because I don't believe the way you do  
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy  
Cause I can't be myself when I'm with you  
No I can't be myself and be what pleases you  
And down deep inside I don't believe that you want me to  
And it's not my way to take so long deciding  
That I can't be myself when I'm with you  
No it's not my way
