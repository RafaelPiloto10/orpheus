Everything I want I have  
Money, notoriety, rivieras  
I even think I found God  
In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,  
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras  
Am I glamorous, baby am I glamorous  
  
Hello, hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you  
  
Summertime is nice and hot  
And my life is sweet like vanilla is  
Gold and silver line my heart  
But burned into to my brain all these stolen images  
Stolen images, baby stolen images  
Can you picture this  
What a life we could've lived  
  
Hello hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful they all say I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you  
  
We were two kids just tryin to get out  
Live on the dark side of the american dream  
We would stay out late, play our music loud  
When we grew up nothing was what it seemed  
  
Hello hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful they think that I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you
