Wake up and talk to me  
It's a long time since last night  
I know we said things, the saddest things  
And I'm not sure it was wise  
When the morning's sad  
You don't look back  
And you sure don't look ahead  
The morning sad  
You know, the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
I'm writing desperate songs  
While you're fast asleep inside  
I could try to sing  
(I could try to bide my time to wake up)  
Until it rings  
But my voice comes out uptight  
So when the morning's sad  
You don't relax,  
No you cannot clear your mind  
The morning sad  
You know the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
I tried a little  
I tried a lot  
I'm not a window  
And you've seen through everything I've got  
Oh, I don't think that I'll be safe  
Until everyone's awake  
Everybody, everybody, everybody, yeah  
So wake up and talk to me  
Such a long time since last night  
I know we said things, the maddest things  
And I'm not sure who was right  
When the morning's sad  
You won't attack  
Cause you're much to weak to bite  
The morning sad  
You know the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
No  
Never had it so bad  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Never had it so bad
