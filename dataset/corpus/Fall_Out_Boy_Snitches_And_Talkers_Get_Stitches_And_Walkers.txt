Show me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid  
I, I, I will break his jaw  
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up  
No, oh, oh, oh  
And I will save him from himself  
Here's a picture with a note  
"No, don't turn out like me"  
It's only for your own good  
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And haven't you heard  
The word on the street is  
"I lost it, called it quits"  
Get it into the sun,  
Out from behind the gossip  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, k-keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow-ow - ow  
  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Even when there's  
Nothing worth living for  
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for  
N-no one has to know-ow-ow  
And haven't you heard  
The word on the street is  
"I lost it, called it quits"  
Get it into the sun  
Out from behind the gossip  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old (this story's getting old)  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now,  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old (this story's getting old)  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now  
Now, now, now  
  
Stop!
