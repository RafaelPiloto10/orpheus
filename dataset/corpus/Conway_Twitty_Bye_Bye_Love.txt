Bye bye love bye bye happiness hello loneliness I think I'm a gonna cry  
Bye bye my love bye bye  
There goes my baby with someone new she sure looks happy and I sure am blue  
She was my baby till he stepped in goodbye to romance that might have been  
Bye bye love bye bye happiness hello loneliness I think I'm a gonna cry  
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress hello emptiness I feel like I could die  
Bye bye my love bye bye  
  
Well I'm through with you Conway I'm through with love  
Yeah I'm through with countin' the stars above  
And here's the reason that I'm so free my lovin' baby is through with me  
Bye bye love bye bye happiness...  
Bye bye love bye bye happiness...
