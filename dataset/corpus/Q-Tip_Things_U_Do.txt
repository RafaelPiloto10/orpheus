Lets talk about these things we see  
Walking across the land  
Lets talk about these joints I got  
Every body get down  
Lets talk about these things we see  
Lets talk about these joints I got  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets talk about the rules I bring  
And the things we take  
And the jobs we hold  
And the land we stole  
And a buck or two  
And the love for you  
And the things you do [Repeat: x5]  
  
I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen  
I break spells with faith in a burst of wind  
Others talk but.what they talk about?  
Who could walk but live what they walkabout  
A calm head in the middle of wartime  
People go down just so they could get more shine  
Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty  
Niggas got geez but its not really mack to me  
Keep it soft like we killers and often gat  
You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back  
Abstract see it like this is the king in you  
Allies living one more if I'm fucking too  
Dogs don't eat it up increase they feeding time  
I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine  
Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle  
Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart  
Look around you tell me who else is shining girl  
Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl  
That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has  
Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass  
But watch I'ma drop to a bronco  
See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!  
And just know that your man to can get that  
And just though that I don't really wet that  
And just know that this nigga here flips tracks  
Ooh what, whose ya, pain and slip that  
The illest regiment is what I represent  
Get us mad you gonna see the way gorillas went  
Mactime I need a diamond at least a friend  
I fear Allah he has no start and he has no end  
We raise the roof up and tear the fuck up off  
Bucking hard like the coast guard, who's soft?  
  
[Chorus: x3]
