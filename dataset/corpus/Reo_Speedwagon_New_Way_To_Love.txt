Maybe we don't need to share the same roof, maybe  
If you really love me, you don't need me 'round for proof, baby  
If I go to the desert for some clean dry air  
We could have ourselves a long distance love affair  
We'll take it anywhere, a nationwide pair  
Well If your living together isn't working out  
I'd rather live in Nebraska, than keep livin' here in doubt  
I'll take an alternate route, I'll find a new way  
There are places to go that we've never dreamed of  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna find a new way to love, find out what satisfies us  
The good old ways just ain't good enough  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
Maybe we could learn to like the same things, maybe  
Discover the joy that togetherness brings, baby  
We could share our records, we could see the same plays  
Even plan our vacations for the very same days  
We'll put our lives in phase, livin' in a happiness haze  
Well it may not be easy, but then nothin' else was  
Ask a mountain climber why he does what he does  
He'll tell you just because, I need to find a new way  
Hey now we've got a mountain of our own to rise above  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe we don't need to see eye to eye, maybe  
We don't need to vote for the very same guy, baby  
You can move to the left whenever I keep right  
I'm a big bad wolf, you can be Snow White  
I've got a huge appetite, you want to eat light  
I'm down here beggin' for more, you tell me you've had enough  
We gotta find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We're gonna find a new way to love
