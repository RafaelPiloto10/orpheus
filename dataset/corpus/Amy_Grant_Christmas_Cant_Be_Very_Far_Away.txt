Little bits of heaven  
Floating gently by the window  
Soon this dirty city will be  
Covered with a new snow  
  
Let's put on our winter boots  
Go outside and play  
Christmas can't be very far away  
  
Weather girl says "bundle up"  
It's gonna be a cold one  
I'll put on my wooly hat  
You'll wear your dad's old Stetson  
  
Pretty lights are everywhere  
Shining night and day  
Christams can't be very far away  
  
Let's take a walk downtown and  
Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
We'll get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what we've got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin' snowballs  
At each other's such a fun time  
  
Kids will think we're crazy  
For awhile and that's okay  
Christmas can't be very far away  
Christmas can't be very far away
