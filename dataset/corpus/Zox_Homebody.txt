Well I flew in on a plane yesterday  
Nose pressed to the glass, I watched us come into the bay  
And then I asked myself why I left this place  
Seeking solace in a change but now it's changed my face  
And I know  
They'll say  
There's something to be said for trying out new things  
But I know  
I'll say  
Something I've been missing here along the way  
Oh yeah  
  
But there's just something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home  
  
And it's so hot outside that I could fry an egg  
But I'm eating Taco Bell and gettin' high instead  
My eyes spread wide I smoke a cigarette  
Watch the sun roll by with nothing in my head  
And I know  
They'll say  
Something to be said for curiosity  
And I know  
I'll say  
I'll save my west coast dreaming for some other day  
Oh yeah  
  
Because there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home to California  
I said there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Oh there's something 'bout coming home  
Yeah  
  
I said, I said  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the Daily News  
And there's something in the air I breathe  
Something in the things I see  
And there's something in these orange walls  
The Northern California falls  
There's something in the clothes she wears  
And something in the way she stares at you  
  
Oh and I'm so far away from home and I need it  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Because there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Oh there's something 'bout coming home to California  
There's something 'bout going home
