If maybe you'd move over,  
Gave someone else a chance to try their luck,  
Instead, you run up closer,  
Try'n to grab a page before they close the book.  
  
[Chorus]  
It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began  
Hope you take it like a friend.  
It's a shame to see you cryin' , wouldn't think to way back when,  
Looks like i'll never hear the end.  
  
Thought you had the honor,  
Took special pride in all your well laid plans.  
  
Forgot about the others,  
We moved out t'ward the light showin' empty hands.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah, put the boot down! mm-hm!  
  
Love to be the winner.  
Gather up your chips in time to cash 'em in.  
We're all lookin' thinner,  
Playin' cards too close for either one to win.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when,  
Hope you take it like a friend.  
Yeah
