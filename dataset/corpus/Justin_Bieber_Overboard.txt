It feels like we've been out at sea, whoa  
So back and forth that's how it seems, whoa  
And when I wanna talk you say to me  
That if it's meant to be it will be, whoa oh no  
  
So crazy in this thing we call love  
And now that we've got it we just can't give up  
I'm reaching out for you  
Got me out here in the water, and I  
  
I'm overboard, and I need your love  
Pull me up, I can't swim on my own  
It's too much, feel like I'm drowning without your love  
So throw yourself out to me
