These fingers so frail paint in my mind  
Scars down the back of my eyes  
Death walks with me alone tonight  
The coldness whispers it's almost near  
Rest for soon it will be over  
Years flash before my and I understand why I'm here  
No one will ever know, as the pictures come clear  
Don't worry they tell me this feeling won't last forever  
Voices beating their drums in my heart  
The water looks so peaceful below and the struggle lets go  
Climbing over the wall of life's edge  
Leaving behind the smiles of yesterday  
The light that shined has vanished to a grayscale of night  
Tears once present now look into the dryness inside  
Silent words enter the sky screamed  
From this body as a reply, and these words begin to write  
Dear Lord, if these break the earth  
And enter your courts save me tonight  
Time is short and the hurt of death grows with every breath  
Here I am at the end  
This wall that blocked you out for so long opens wide  
And I begin to burn from the inside  
I'll never forget that night  
The night Jesus Christ made the blackness white
