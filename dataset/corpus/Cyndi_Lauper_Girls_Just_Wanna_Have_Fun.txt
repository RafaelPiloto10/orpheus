I come home in the morning light  
My mother says when you gonna live your life right  
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones  
And girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun  
  
The phone rings in the middle of the night  
My father yells what you gonna do with your life  
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one  
But girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just want to have  
  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Oh girls, they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wantna have fun (girls and boys wanna have fun, girls wanna
have)  
  
Some boys take a beautiful girl  
And hide her away from the rest of the world  
I want to be the one to walk in the sun  
Oh girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have  
  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Oh girls, they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun (girls and boys wanna have fun, girls wanna
have)  
They just wanna, they just wanna  
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl  
Girls they wanna have fun  
They just wanna, they just wanna  
They just wanna, they just wanna, girls  
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls  
Girls just want to have fun  
  
When the working  
When the working day is done  
Oh when the working day is done oh girl  
Girls, they wanna have fun  
  
They just wanna, they just wanna  
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls  
Girls just want to have fun  
  
(They just wanna, they just wanna)  
When the working  
When the working day is done  
Oh when the working day is done oh girl  
Girls, they wanna have fun
