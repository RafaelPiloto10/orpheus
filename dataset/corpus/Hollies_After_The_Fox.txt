Who is the fox - I am the fox  
Who are you - I am me  
Who is me - Me is a thief  
You'll bring your poor, poor mother grief  
  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
Where is the gold - It's on the truck  
Where's the truck - I won't tell  
You must tell - Then I will lie  
You'll make your poor, poor sister cry  
  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
Why do you steal - So I'll be rich  
Why not work - Work is hard  
You'll be caught - I never fail  
All little crooks wind up in jail - Not me not me  
  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Off to the hunt with chains and locks  
So after the fox, after the fox  
Someone is always chasing after the fox  
  
After the fox  
After the fox  
After the fox
