today is gonna be the day  
that they're gonna throw it back to you  
by now you should've somehow  
realized what you gotta do  
I don't believe that anybody  
feels the way I do about you now  
backbeat the word was on the street  
that the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before  
but you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels  
the way I do about you now  
and all the roads we have to walk along are winding  
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
there are many things that I would like to say to you  
but I don't know how  
because maybe..  
you're gonna be the one who saves me? .
