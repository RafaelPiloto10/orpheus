All of me loves all of you  
Every part of me  
Down to the heart of me  
Loves you through and through  
Now wanting you it's all I do  
All of my loves all of you  
  
O' I have hear those tender words  
But my heart wasn't listenin'  
Till I found you I never knew  
Just what I was missin'  
  
O' I have hear those tender words  
But my heart wasn't listenin'  
Till I found you I never knew  
Just what I was missin'  
  
All of me loves all of you
