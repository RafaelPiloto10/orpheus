Let me take you to the place  
Where membership's a smiling face,  
Brush shoulders with the stars.  
Where strangers take you by the hand,  
And welcome you to wonderland  
From beneath their panamas  
  
[Chorus]  
Club Tropicana, drinks are free,  
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone.  
All that's missing is the sea,  
But don't worry, you can suntan!  
  
Castaways and Lovers meet,  
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,  
Watch the waves break on the bay.  
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,  
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,  
A whole night's holiday!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pack your bags,  
And leave tonight.  
Don't take your time,  
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!  
Cool, cool, cool, cool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cool, cool, cool, cool
