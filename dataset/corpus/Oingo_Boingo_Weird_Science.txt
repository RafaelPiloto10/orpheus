(She's alive, Alive!)  
(Weird science)  
Weird, ooo!  
Weird Science  
Plastic tubes and pots and pans  
Bits and pieces and  
Magic from the hand  
We're makin'  
  
(Weird science)  
Things I've never seen before  
Behind bolted doors  
Talent and imagination  
  
(Weird science)  
Not what teacher said to do  
Makin' dreams come true  
Living tissue, warm flesh  
  
(Weird science)  
Plastic tubes and pots and pans  
Bits and pieces (and)  
Bits and pieces (and)  
  
(Bits of) my creation--Is it real?  
It's my creation...my creation  
It's my creation  
  
Weird Science  
Weird, ooo!  
  
(Weird science)  
Magic and technology  
Voodoo dolls and chants  
Electricity We're makin'  
  
(Weird science)  
Fantasy and microchips  
Shooting from the hip  
Something different  
We're makin'  
  
(Weird science)  
Pictures from a magazine  
Diagrams and charts  
Mending broken hearts (and makin')  
  
(Weird science) Something like a recipe  
Bits and pieces (and)  
Bits and pieces (and)  
  
(Bits of) my creation--Is it real?  
It's my creation--I do not know  
No hesitation--No heart of gold  
Just flesh and blood--I do not know  
I do not know  
From my heart and from my hand  
Why don't people understand  
My intentions, Ooh, weird science  
  
Magic and technology  
Weird Science  
Things we never seen before  
Weird Science  
Not what teacher said to do  
  
Bits and pieces (and)  
Bits and pieces (and)  
  
(Bits of) my creation--Is it real?  
It's my creation--I do not know  
No hesitation--No heart of gold  
Just flesh and blood--I do not know  
It's my creation  
It's my creation...ooo!  
my creation  
It's my creation  
It's my creation  
  
From my heart and from my hand  
Why don't people understand  
My intentions, ooh, weird science  
  
Weird ooh

Weird  
Bits and pieces
