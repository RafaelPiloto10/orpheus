I hear every word they say  
They tell me to stay away  
They say I'm better off without you, baby  
You've caused me nothing but pain  
  
Heartache's your middle name  
But seems I never see it coming  
I'll just admit it baby  
You really drive me crazy  
  
Let go of my heart  
'Cause every time you're near me  
I can't think clearly  
Defenses fall apart  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
I never will understand  
Why I let you think you can  
Treat me any way you please, baby  
I guess I hope someday  
  
You'll settle down and say  
Give me all the love I need, baby  
Time and time I've found  
You always let me down  
  
Always ends the same way  
You'd think that I could see the way you're treatin' me  
Won't ever change  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
If I could just hold on, if I could just be strong  
My heart would see it's wrong, lovin' you, lovin' you  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
Livin' and lovin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, oh baby, of my life  
Livin' and lovin' the hard way  
Someday, I will get it right
