Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you it's my conviction  
That sets me apart from the rest  
  
I live for competition  
Your cynicism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
Setting the standard that all will follow  
  
I live it every day  
Don't know another way  
  
Within my eyes there's devastation and fury  
You can't understand  
In my fight  
Win by attrition I bring it with all that I fucking am  
  
You never dealt with such rejection  
Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal  
You've never seen so much aggression  
I am the scream to your fucking silence  
  
I live it every day  
Don't know another way  
  
Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you it's my affliction  
That creates the template of all that I am  
  
You know and I know  
No matter what you say  
You'll be beaten today  
Like every other day  
  
Something about you  
Keeps you from letting go  
Of lame obsessions  
Built up inside you  
Forget the guesswork  
You're starting at the source  
Gazing into my eyes  
You'll see there's no remorse  
'Cause this is my war  
All day and every day  
It's all about the conflict  
Yeah!  
  
Bring on the competition  
Your pessimism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
The fucking standard that all will follow  
  
I live it everyday  
Don't know another way
