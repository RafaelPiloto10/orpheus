Ther's a redhead from my hometown that loves to let her hair down  
She tears my heart out when she starts to sing  
She's from the right side of Red River and she's pretty as a picture  
Don't you know she's this ole cowboy's dream  
  
There's a boy from Okie City and I sure think he's pretty  
But I know he's trying to steal my heart away  
Oh my mama tried to warn me he's done time in California  
But he'll be an Okie til his dyin' day  
  
There's a dance we do in Oklahoma  
A dnace like you've never seen  
Sit back and we're gonna show ya  
How to do that Oklahoma swing  
  
Well when two Okies get together man there's nothin' they like better  
Than to hold each other on a dawdust floor  
Oh I love it when we're swayin' to those sweet twi fiddles playin'  
Come on boy what are we waitin' for  
  
There's a dance we do in Oklahoma  
A dnace like you've never seen  
Sit back and we're gonna show ya  
How to do that Oklahoma swing
