I get up in the morning and what do I find  
You been talkin' all night on a party line  
  
You better watch your mouth (watch your mouth)  
I said watch your mouth (watch your mouth)  
Watch your mouth, well did you? What did you say?  
Watch your mouth  
  
Always tellin' everybody things I do  
Well now you can tel 'em that I'm through with you  
  
You better hear big mama 'cause I want it understood  
A loose-lip-woman just ain't no good  
  
Everytime I see you walkin' down the street  
Your big mouth is movin' just as fast as your feet  
  
Always talkin' about me I know  
If you don't shut your mouth, go on get out that door
