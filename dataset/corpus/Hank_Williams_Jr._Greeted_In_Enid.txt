Well if your from Texas it's more or less a law  
There's no love loss for Oklahoma, especially in football  
Well partner it's time for that ol' myth to die  
I want you to see how they treated me in Enid last night  
  
I was feeling low in Fort Worth, I had the heartbreak blues  
My sweet love had left me for some California dude  
To Sacramento that girl did go, said she won't be back  
Well I never thought I could feel so good after I hurt so bad  
  
Yes I was greeted in Enid last night  
That old Oklahoma hospitality was really nice  
Cause my girl walked out in cow-town and left me high and dry  
But I was trapped down and loved on site  
Oh those sooner folks are alright  
I was greeted in Enid last night  
  
Now thie pretty Ok-city-billy has really stole my heart  
And I'll take bets that her and Tex are never gonna part  
Well who would dream it here in Enid I would meet my wife  
And Oklahoma and Texas are gonna get along just fine  
  
Yes I was greeted in Enid last night  
That good old Oklahoma hospitality was really nice  
Yes my girl walked out in cow-town and she told me bye bye  
But I was trapped down and loved on site  
Oh those sooner folks are alright  
I was greeted in Enid last night  
  
I think I forgot my hat honey
