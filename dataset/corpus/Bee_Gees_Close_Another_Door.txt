Many years have passed, it seems,  
And I am all alone.  
I've sent the children far away  
To some obscure unknown.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It's so sad,  
So sad.  
Close another door.  
Listen to my eyes.  
Close another door.  
You're much too old to work,  
So won't you run away?  
  
When I was young, I used to say  
That age won't bother me.  
The life I had was very sad,  
It all went out to sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though the sun is in outside,  
The rain is in my hair.  
Now my life is lived inside,  
(Now all my life is mystified)  
My home is in my chair.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me go.  
Send me flowers and  
Put me on a plane.  
I've paid before,  
  
So I've been told  
At least I'm alive  
  
I may be old but I've been told at least I'm still alive  
Fly me young, fly, and tomorrow, yeah  
Get me up  
I been working so, so very hard
