February morning, my car won't start today  
I turned the key at 8: 03 and the battery passed away  
Inside a' my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want to drive it all around this world  
  
Bride's gettin' married in the springtime  
Widow's gettin married in the fall  
I got married in high school  
Or I wouldn't of got married at all  
I'd be drivin' my automobile  
Be drivin' my automobile  
Be drivin' my automobile  
I wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Everybody said to the new groom  
Groom, what ya gonna be  
I said I'm gonna be a symphony  
Just as soon as I find a key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
All around this world  
  
Spoken:  
Let's take a ride  
  
Columbus sailed the ocean  
Moses parted the sea  
Dolores left me yesterday  
Well, I think she took the key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Now I held a little bitty baby  
I held a woman all night  
Whenever I get the hiccups  
I hold my breath 'til my head gets light  
Then I drive my automobile  
Yeah I drive my automobile  
I drive my automobile  
I'm want to drive it all around this world  
  
February morning, my car won't start today  
Yeah, I turned the key at 8: 03  
And the battery passed away  
Inside a' my automobile  
I'm drivin' my automobile  
Wanna my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
Go on.  
  
Spoken:  
It is a beautiful day for a ride  
Hey, get your head down I can't see anything  
Someone give me a cigarette  
I don't want to take my hands off the wheel  
We ought to take the air filter off this sucker.  
So we can see what it will really do.  
Uh oh, it looks to me like a hos-pital zone  
Everybody get quiet. Shhhhhhhh.  
Don't wake the dead up.  
We're almost out. Hang on. Uh oh here we go.  
Well, you can just hold it until we get to the next town.
