Like most babies smell like butter  
His smell smelled like no other  
He was born scentless and senseless  
He was born a scentless apprentice  
  
Go away - get away, get away, get a-way  
Every wet nurse refused to feed him  
Electrolytes smell like semen  
  
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets  
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers  
  
I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms  
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume  
  
You can't fire me because I quit  
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
