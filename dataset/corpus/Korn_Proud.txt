Must you keep looking at me  
Before you looked the other way.  
Must you keep glaring at me  
I know you look inside, and see what you made.  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now I'm your everything  
It's finding out ya own me  
Not all of your gloating.  
  
Must you keep looking at me.  
Now you see what I am.  
Trust, I knew what it was.  
I don't forget things, thinking I'm nothing.  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now I'm your everything  
It's finding out ya own(owe?) me  
Not all of your gloating.  
  
Pride of me  
No Pride  
Why?  
  
Must you keep looking at me  
Before you looked the other way  
Trust, I knew what it was  
I don't forget things, look what you've made.  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now I'm your everything  
It's finding out ya own(owe?) me  
Not all of your gloating
