Ohh oh, ohh oh, ah  
Sing to me baby, baby  
Buckets, nuggets of rain  
Nuggets of rain, nuggets of tears  
Got all the nuggets comin' out of my ears  
Nuggets of moonbeams in my hand  
You got all the love, honey baby, I can stand  
I been down, high like an oak  
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear  
You want me, honey baby, I'll be here  
Ohh, I'll be here  
Ooh  
Sing to me baby, baby, baby  
Buckets of rain  
I like your smile and your fingertips  
I like the way that you move your lips  
I like that heavenly way you look at me  
Everything about you is bringing me ecstasy  
Little red wagon, little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like  
I like the way you monkey around  
Stick with me baby and we'll never be found  
Life is heavy and life is sad  
Life is a bust when you think you've been had  
Your live, you must do and you do it bad  
I do it for you, honey baby, ain't you glad?  
Ohh oh, ohh, ooh  
Bobby, Bobby  
Hey there Mister D  
You set me free, yeah  
I don't believe I really said that  
Hum, meany  
Ooh, you don't even know, you have no idea  
I don't want to know  
You and Paul Simon should have done this one
