Well it's concrete and asphalt drivin' into work every day  
This livin' can't be healthy but the Lord knows I got bills to pay  
And there's others here just like me, they got families to feed  
  
[Chorus]  
One more time arouund, time around, on the job is where I'll be found  
One more time arouund, time around, earn my pay and hear that whistle sound  
  
Well thunder and lighting, it don't matter, nothin' stops the clock  
The radios are blastin', mine is playin' country, some play rock  
The rhythm and blues of the workplace, we take pride in everything we make  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Five o'clock is comin', we're all racin' down the same track  
Life is a circle, sometimes we meet ourselves comin' back, well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One more time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around
