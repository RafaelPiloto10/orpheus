Silly boy, to think that she loves you  
You're a toy, just part of the game  
You think she needs you  
But she misleads you  
Yes, she's your girl, but only in name  
  
Tenderly, she'll call you her only love  
Can't you see her heart breaking aim?  
She'll call you lover, then kiss another  
Yes, she's your girl, but only in name  
  
She's a girl with no heart at all  
Breaking ev'ry rule  
Still you wait on her beck and call  
While she plays the field,  
You play the fool  
  
Please believe  
These things that I'm telling you  
She deceived my heart just the same  
She was my lover 'til I discovered  
That she was my girl, but only in name
