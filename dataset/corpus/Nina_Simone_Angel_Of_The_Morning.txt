There'll be no strings to bind your hands  
Not if my love can't bind your heart  
And there's no need to take a stand  
For it was I who chose to start  
  
There is no need to take me home  
I'm old enough to face the dawn  
Just call me angel of the morning  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby  
  
Just call me angel of the morning  
Slowly slowly turn away from me  
Well maybe the sun's light will be dim  
but it won't matter anyhow  
  
If morning echo says we've sinned  
Well, it was what I wanted now.  
And if we're the victims of the night  
I promise you I won't be blinded by light  
  
Just call me angel  
Touch my cheek before you leave me baby.  
Just call me angel of the morning morning  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby  
  
Just call me angel of the morning (baby  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby)  
Just call me angel of the morning  
Slowly slowly turn away from me from me  
From me
