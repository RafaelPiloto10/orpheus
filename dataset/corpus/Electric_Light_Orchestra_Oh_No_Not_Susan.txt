Susan spent the weekend at her stately home  
Crying at the lions on the garden wall  
And then she'd sigh - sneak away  
Look at her style - free the day  
  
Oh no not me - I wouldn't  
Oh no not me - I couldn't  
That's all she says, her money and her place  
They just don't mean a thing  
  
Susan met the lords and dukes of everywhere  
Smiling kissing wishing that they'd go to hell  
And then she'd laugh - wonder why  
Take a nap - sit and cry  
  
Oh no not me - I wouldn't  
Oh no not me - I couldn't  
That's all she says, her money and her place  
They just don't mean a thing
