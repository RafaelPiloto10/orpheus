Well, a nickel is a nickel, a dime is a dime  
I need a new man, Lord I know I won't mind.  
Tell me how long, dear, do I have to wait?  
Can I get you now, dear, must I hesitate?  
  
Well now, the eagle on the dollar says "In God we trust"  
You say you won't obey me, you wanna see that dollar first  
How long, dear, do I have to wait?  
Can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate?  
  
Lord, if the river was made of whiskey an' I was a duck,  
I'd just swim to the bottom an' I'd never come up.  
How long, dear, mm, do I have to wait?  
Why, can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate?  
  
Now there's rocks down in the ocean and there's fish in the sea,  
I know you mean the whole world to me.  
How long, dear, must I have to wait?  
Can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate?  
  
I got them Hesitation Stockings, I got them Hesitation Shoes,  
Lord knows I got them Hesitation Blues.  
Tell me, how long do I have to wait?  
Why, can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate?
