Starting today I'm not gonna waste another moment  
Even if I had the chance before I would have blown it  
But you took me by surprise  
And you caught me just in time  
Everyday you give me reason not to walk away  
I stop believing that the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
Starting today I'm not gonna worry about tomorrow  
I'll wash away all this fear that's left me feeling hollow  
Cause you made me want to try  
And you caught me just in time  
Everyday you give me reason not to walk away  
I'll stop believing I should burn like crazy  
Cos if I did you chase me  
  
Anyway, I should have told you  
So many times  
That I shyed away  
Somehow you always seem to  
Be there, making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay  
  
Everyday, Everyday, Everyday  
Oh everyday I'll stop believing that I should burn like crazy  
Cos if I did you chase me  
Anyway you give me reason not to walk away  
I stop believing that the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting today I'm not gonna waste another moment...
