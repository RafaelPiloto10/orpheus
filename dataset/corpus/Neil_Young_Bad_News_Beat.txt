Have you heard the news  
I lost my baby to another man  
I got a bulletin of news  
Late breaking story that I don't understand  
Should I call her up late  
Should I ask her how she really feels  
Should I try to make a date  
For a time when we can touch  
And feel.  
  
She' so on fire  
She's my desire.  
  
I've got the bad news beat  
And my reception is loud and clear  
I've got a man in the street  
Telling me what I don't want to hear  
I've got an eye in the sky  
Taking pictures that I don't want to see  
She's got a brand new guy  
Looks like she's never coming back  
To me.  
  
She' so on fire  
She's my desire.  
  
I've got an eye in the sky  
I've got a man in the street  
I've got the bad news beat  
I've got the bad news beat
