On a shameless night  
In a nameless place  
I thought that love was a hopeless case til I found you, til I found you  
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city  
The world's no love just pain and pity til I found you, til I found you  
  
And you don't know how you saved me  
And you don't know what you gave me  
And you don't know how you saved my life  
  
I can see the light  
I have flown away  
I have come alive  
I am blown away  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found, now that I found you  
I can live my life  
I believe in faith  
I have found myself  
I have lost the hate  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found you, now that I found you  
  
(Yeah)

Now I adore you
