Hold my hand while you cut me down  
It had only just begun but now it's over now  
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold  
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold  
In my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night  
The night  
Fell off your mind  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired  
  
Where'd you go when you stayed behind  
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find  
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile  
I get closer you obviously prefer her  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Boy I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired  
  
(I should have known)  
  
Never mind said your open arms  
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Boy I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired
