Cold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go  
When our nerves were razor sharp, and we'd all let it roll  
Let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll  
  
Our machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down  
Layin' it out, let it roll  
  
When these wheels get rollin'  
Let 'em roll right over you  
'Cause I'm well greased down, and I'll always win it through  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll  
  
Our machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down  
Layin' it out, let it roll  
  
Cold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go
