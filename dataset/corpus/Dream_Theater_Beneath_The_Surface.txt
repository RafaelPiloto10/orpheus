Is there ever really a right time  
You had led me to believe  
Someday you'd be there for me  
When the stars above align  
When you weren't so consumed  
I kept looking for the clues  
So I waited in the shadows of my heart  
And still the time was never right  
  
Until one day I stopped caring  
And began to forget why I longed to be so close  
And I disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turned to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
  
A shell of what things could have been  
Tired bones beneath the veil  
Of guarded secrets all too frail  
Sad to think I never knew  
You were searching for the words  
For the moment to emerge  
Yet the moment never came  
You couldn't risk my fragile frame  
  
Until one day you stopped caring  
And began to forget why you tried to be so close  
And you disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turn to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
  
I would scream just to be heard  
As if yelling at the stars  
I was bleeding just to feel  
You would never say a word  
Kept me reaching in the dark  
Always something to conceal  
  
Until one day I stopped scaring  
And began to forget why I longed to be so close  
And I disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turned to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
Beneath the surface
