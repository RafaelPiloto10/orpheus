I come back, come back  
You see my return  
My returning face is smiling  
Smile of a waiting man  
  
I be home soon soon soon  
Soon cry on your shoulder  
Your shoulder against my burning tears  
Tears of a waiting man  
  
One two three four one two three  
I wait every moment  
I wait, wait for my chance  
I wait for my friend to say  
Hello, you waiting man  
  
Feel no fret feel no fret feel no fret  
You can wait and feel no fret  
And so I wait so I wait so I wait so I wait  
I return face is smiling  
  
Be home soon cry on your shoulder  
Tears of a waiting man  
Every moment wait for my chance  
My friend say hello feel no fret  
You can wait and I wait and I wait  
And home I am
