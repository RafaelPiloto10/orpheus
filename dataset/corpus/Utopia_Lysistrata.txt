Lysistrata, open up the bedroom door  
What is the matter, ain't you in love with me no more?  
I enlisted in the army today,  
One more time before I march away  
  
Make me feel like a big strong man  
You say you don't care about my pride,  
You love me too much just to let me die,  
And you won't let me come inside  
  
Unless I don't go to war no more  
Lysistrata, little boys like to have their fun,  
And you know I gotta put on my colors and get my gun  
Every able bodied man that I know,  
  
Every patriot is packed to go  
Won't you give me a last goodbye  
I'll be sent off to a distant land,  
To spill my blood upon some foreign sand,  
  
And I may die by an enemy's hand  
And then I won't go to war no more  
Send the boys all back to the farm  
Tell the troops it was a false alarm,  
  
'Cause if I die I want to be in your arms,  
And so I won't go to war, no I won't go to war,  
Said I won't go to war no more
