I hear you had a good offer down on Third Avenue  
You tell me that was the reason  
For whatcha' put me through, yeah  
And now you come collapsin' back  
I feel the heat of your attack  
Want me to take you back  
I'm givin' you the sack  
So don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a little too little  
It's a little too late  
I'm a little too hurt  
And there's nothin' left that I've gotta say  
You can cry to me baby  
But there's only so much I can take  
Ah, it's a little too little  
It's a little too late  
  
You say you had a good time  
But did ya' think it was for free - yeah  
And how much did it get ya', all their flattery  
And now you come back, runnin' for protection  
You've been bitten by love and stung by rejection  
You can't connect  
What did you expect?  
I'm still gettin' over you  
  
[Chorus x4]
