Grow into me like a vine through a sidewalk  
Struggling to reach for the sky  
Grow into me like the veins on my forehead  
that stand out whenever I cry  
  
Oh, I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh, will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead?  
Will you be everything I need?  
  
Climb next to me up the trail, up the mountain  
Even though times running out  
Night falls around, there's no light in the distance  
Only my shadows of doubt  
  
Oh, I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh, will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead?  
Will you be everything I need?  
  
Will you be everything I need?
