Times are hard  
You're afraid to pay the fee  
So you find yourself somebody  
Who can do the job for free  
When you need a bit of lovin'  
Cause your man is out of town  
That's the time you get me runnin'  
And you know I'll be around  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
I don't want to do your dirty work  
No more  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
  
Light the candle  
Put the lock upon the door  
You have sent the maid home early  
Like a thousand times before  
Like the castle in its corner  
In a medieval game  
I foresee terrible trouble  
And I stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]
