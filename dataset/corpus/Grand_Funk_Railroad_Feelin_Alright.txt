Seems I got to have a change in scene,  
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams.  
Imprisoned by the way things used to be, yeah,  
Left here on my own or so it seems.  
I got to leave before I start to scream,  
'Cause somebody locked the door and took the key.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.  
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.  
  
Baby, you sure took me on one big ride,  
And, even now I sit and wonder why.  
Then, when I think of you, I start to cry,  
I know I can't get upset and I must keep dry.  
I got to stop believin' in all your lies,  
'Cause I got too much to do before I die.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.
