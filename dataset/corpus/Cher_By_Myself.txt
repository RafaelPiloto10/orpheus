I gotta go on my way by myself  
Because this is the end of romance  
I gotta go my way all by myself  
Love it's only it's only a dance  
I'm gonna try to apply myself  
And teach my poor heart how to sing  
I gotta go I want to go my way all by myself  
Just like just like a bird on a wing  
I'm gonna face the unknown  
I'm gonna feel, I'm gonna feel  
The way on my own  
Cause nobody knows better than I myself  
You see I'm by myself all alone  
  
I gotta go I gotta go on my way by myself  
This is the end, the end  
The end, end of romance  
I gotta go I gotta go my way all by myself  
Love is only a dance  
Cause I gotta go, I gotta see  
I gotta try my own thing by myself  
And teach my poor heart how to sing  
I gotta go I gotta try  
My own thing all by myself  
Just like a bird I'm out on a wing  
I'm gonna face the unknown  
I'm want to feel I gotta feel I want to feel  
A world of my own  
Nobody nobody knows better than I myself  
You see I'm by myself all alone
