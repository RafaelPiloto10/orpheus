Remember when I took you  
Up to the top of the hill?  
We had our knives drawn.  
They were as sharp  
As we were in love.  
If god crossed us  
We'd take all his drugs,  
Burn his money  
And his house down,  
And wait for the fire to spread.  
  
Sometimes hate is not enough  
To turn this all to ashes.  
Together as one  
Against all others  
Break all of our wings to  
Make sure it crashes  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're running to the  
Edge of the world  
Running, running away  
We're running to the edge of the world  
I don't know if the world will end today  
  
I had no choice,  
I erased the debt of our family,  
Let you say goodbye  
With lips like dynamite.  
And everyone  
Turned their backs  
Because they knew  
When we held on tight  
To each other,  
We were something fatal,  
That fell into the wrong hands.  
  
Sometimes hate is not enough  
To turn this all to ashes.  
Together as one  
Against all others  
Break all of our wings to  
Make sure it crashes  
  
We're running to the  
Edge of the world  
Running, running away  
We're running to the edge of the world  
I don't know if the world will end today  
  
We don't see death, we see destruction [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See a new beginning rise behind the sun  
We can't never catch up to them as fast as we run
