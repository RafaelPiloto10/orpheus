Do me wrong, do me right, do me right baby.  
Tell me lies but hold, hold me tight.  
Save your goodbyes till the morning light,  
But don't let me be lonely tonight.  
  
Say goodbye, woman say hello, say hello.  
It's sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go,  
And don't say yes, but please don't say no.  
I don't want to be lonely tonight.  
  
Go away then, damn you, go on and do as you please, do as you please,  
But you ain't going to see me getting down on my knees,  
'cause I'm undecided and your heart's been divided.  
You've been turning my world upside down.  
  
Do me wrong, do me right, do me right baby.  
Go on and tell me lies but hold, hold me tight.  
And save your goodbyes till the morning light,  
But don't let me be lonely tonight.  
  
Save your goodbyes till the morning light,  
But don't let me be lonely tonight.  
'cause I don't want to be lonely tonight.  
  
I don't want to be lonely.  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it
