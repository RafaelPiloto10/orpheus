Got this endless itch to ride  
Into the night  
Fortune cookie says I'm right  
Kung Fu like  
  
Shake your body Mister  
Gonna make ya body blister, say hey, hey, hey  
Don't wanna have to make ya  
I don't wanna have to shake ya down, hey, hey, hey  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
Pitter, patter doesn't matter what you got  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
Turn you over baby till its never enough  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
Like love  
In the night life  
  
Want to dress for you tonight  
Under the light  
Shot up like a satellite  
Into the night  
Shake ya money maker  
I will never be a faker now, hey hey hey  
Leave 'em standing waitin'  
Till they're practically faintin' now, hey hey hey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight [Repeat x2]  
Under the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Into the night life [repeated]  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight  
Under the light
