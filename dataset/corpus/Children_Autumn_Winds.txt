Autumn winds are blowing free,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Leaves fall down from ev'ry tree,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Red and yellow, gold and brown,  
Softly leaves come tumbling down,  
Autumn winds are blowing free,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
  
Autumn winds are whistling 'round,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Leaves go spinning to the ground,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Big or little, all will fall,  
As they heed the windy call,  
Autumn winds are whistling 'round,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
