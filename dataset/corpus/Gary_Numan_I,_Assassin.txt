We are assassins  
We are not evil  
We act with reason and heart  
Your heart  
  
We are not vicious  
Is that surprising?  
We're so much larger than life  
  
I, assassin, I am  
I, assassin, I am  
  
I just arrived  
Something to fix  
This new depression  
  
We are not hunters  
We are just patient  
We'll wait a lifetime for you  
Just you  
  
I've never felt good  
I've never felt bad  
I've never felt much at all  
  
I, assassin, I am  
I, assassin, I am  
  
There's nothing personal  
Just read the papers  
That's real
