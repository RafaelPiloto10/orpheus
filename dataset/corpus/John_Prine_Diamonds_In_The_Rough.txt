While walking out, one evening  
Not knowing where to go  
Just to pass the time away  
Before we held our show  
I heard a little mission band  
Playing with all their might  
I gave my soul to Jesus  
And left the show that night  
The day will soon be over  
And evening will begone  
No more gems to be gathered  
So let us all press on  
When Jesus comes to claim us  
And says it is enough  
The diamonds will be shining  
No longer in the rough
