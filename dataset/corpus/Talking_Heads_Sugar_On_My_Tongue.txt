Oh, oh, Oh, oh, she's my neighbour  
Fill my cup, I'll bet you baby  
She'll fill it up  
She'll drop the sugar on my tongue  
Will she gimme gimme gimme some  
  
She's gonna put sugar on my tongue  
She's gonna gimme gimme gimme some  
She'll put it right there on my tongue  
Put it right there on my tongue  
  
Sweet sweet, lover lover  
Never never never find another  
to put sugar on my tongue  
Gimme gimme gimme some  
  
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?  
Is she gonna gimme gimme gimme some?  
She'll put it right there on my tongue  
Put it right there on my tongue  
  
I've been waiting years and years  
Finally I see that you appear  
My friends are here, and they ask of me  
'Is this the time that we're gonna see  
her put the sugar on my tongue?'  
  
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?  
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?  
Is she gonna gimme gimme some?  
She'll put it right there on my tongue  
put it right there on my tongue  
  
Sugar on my tongue  
Oh, oh, oh...
