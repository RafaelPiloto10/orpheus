Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, "yoo-hoo!"  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap  
It's grand just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy, and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop!  
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, "yoo-hoo!"  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
