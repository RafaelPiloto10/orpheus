I met an alien one night while I was walking after dark  
He said don't be afraid I've come to know I've come to make my mark  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
He said why are these men and women lying here just on the street  
He said why are these children dying 'cause' they have no food to eat  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
Why are these people hating others for the colour of their skin  
Why are your brother creatures murdered for the flesh that lies within  
Don't lose the rage, don't become immune  
When others criticise you  
Don't change your tune  
You've got to love, with a passion that hurts  
It's love that conquers baby  
Its love that serves  
And in the moment before you go to sleep  
You can turn on me I'm the blue light wrap me round you  
And when the world turns it's coldest shoulder  
In the name of all that's good  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
And I'll be there, to dry your tears  
And I'll be cooking in your kitchen  
Food for everyone  
And ill be working in the backroom  
Help for everyone
