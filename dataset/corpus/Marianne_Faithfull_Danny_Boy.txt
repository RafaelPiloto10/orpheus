Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling.  
It's you, it's you, it's you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
Yes, I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
But when you come, and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead, as dead I well may be  
You'll come and find rhe place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.  
  
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me  
And all my breath shall be warm and sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I will sleep in peace until you come for me.
