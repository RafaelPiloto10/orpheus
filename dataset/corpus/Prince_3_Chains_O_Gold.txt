If I don't think about the fact that she left me  
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky  
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy  
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes  
This is the best day of my life  
You say u'll call me and then and then you don't  
I'll want 2 kiss you and then I won't  
We both do nothing and call it love  
Is this love?  
Is this love?  
  
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee  
But I didn't have any cream  
Last night I wanted some inspiration  
But I didn't have any dreams  
Coupled with the fact that you belong 2 another  
Whose name is self-righteousness  
So evil girl, if one of us has a date  
With the undertaker, which one will it be?  
You can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy  
This is the best day of my life  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down, no, they will never  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down, no, they will never  
  
Give back the chains - if you don't you will die  
Nothing should come between you and I  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
If one of us has 2 go  
You will go before me  
  
If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)  
You will go before me  
(3 chains o' gold)  
You will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)  
Cuz I sho 'nuff say you will  
  
(3 chains o' gold)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
They gonna shine...  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
(3 chains o' gold)
