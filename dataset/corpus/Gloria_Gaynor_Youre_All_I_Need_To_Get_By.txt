When I was just a little girl  
I wanted the world at my feet  
Now all that's changed  
Cause I have loved and  
Now I do concede  
(You're all I need to get by)  
(You're all I need to get by)  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you,  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
I'll sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life to you  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when you lose your will  
I'll be there to push you up the hill  
There's no  
No looking back for us  
We got love sure enough  
That's enough  
You're all  
You're all I need to get by  
Like an eagle protects his nest  
For you I'll do my best  
Stand by you like a tree  
Dare anybody to try and move me  
Darling in you I found  
Strength where I was torn down  
Don't know what's in store  
But together we can open any door  
Just to do what's good for you  
And inspire you a little higher  
I know you can make a woman  
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal  
Cause we, we got the right foundation  
And with love and determination  
You're all, You're All I need to get by.  
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more  
All the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
You're all  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
All I need to get by...  
All I need is you...
