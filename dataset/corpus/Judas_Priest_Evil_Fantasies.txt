We turn and face each other  
My fingers pull your hair  
You wince and jerk my wrist off  
I bite my lip and stare  
Your stance at once defiant  
I'm rigid to your pose  
You clench your teeth in anger  
My loving swells and grows  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
I'll show you evil you can't hide  
  
You're dragged into my vision  
Trapped, serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds  
You slide your nails down in me  
I raise my structure high  
You pout, I snarl, you whimper  
And wave compassion by  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
I'll show you evil you can't hide  
  
Gonna take you, gotta get through  
Gonna make you, do what I want  
  
You're dragged into my vision  
Trapped, serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds
