[Verse 1]  
If you dance I'll dance  
And if you don't I'll dance anyway  
Give peace a chance  
Let the fear you have fall away  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I've got my eye on you  
I've got my eye on you  
  
[Chorus]  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
[Verse 2]  
If you go I'll stay  
You come back I'll be right here  
Like a barge at sea  
In the storm I stay clear  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
'Cause I've got my mind on you  
I've got my mind on you  
  
[Chorus]  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
[Verse 3]  
If you dance I'll dance  
I'll put my red dress on again  
And if you fight I'll fight  
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
I've got my mind on you  
I've got my mind on you  
  
[Chorus]  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
Say yes to heaven  
Say yes to me  
  
[Outro]  
I've got my eye on you  
I've got my eye on you  
I've got my eye on you  
I've got my eye on you
