Do you wanna know why I'm here tonight  
Well I'll tell you  
  
(Beatboxing)  
Rapping: Everyone knows me as a superstar, but this is how I lived my life
before  
First I was Destiny Hope but I really smile a lot  
  
So I got the name Smiley then I shortened it to Miley  
In 2006 I did Hannah Montana  
In 2008 I had my first album  
In 2009 Hannah Montana The Movie  
In 2010 I did "The Last Song"  
  
Now Here I am in snl  
I see Taylor...  
Spoken: Hi Taylor  
Rapping:... In the audience  
  
If you're wondering why I broke up with Nick Jonas...  
Nothing about that, about that now  
Cause I'm having a party on Saturday Night  
It's a party here in snl  
  
Spoken: Well Taylor Swift is not preforming. I am, but we'll have a great show
anyway. So stick around we'll be right back.
