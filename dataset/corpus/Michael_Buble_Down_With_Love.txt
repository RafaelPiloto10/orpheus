Down with love the flowers and rice and shoes  
Down with love the root of all midnight blues  
Down with things that give you that well-known pain  
Take that moon wrap it in cellophane  
  
Down with love let's liquidate all its friends  
Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends  
Down with songs that moan about night and day  
Down with love yes take it away, away  
  
Away  
Far away  
Give it back to the birds and bees and the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs and down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
Down with love  
  
Down with love let's liquidate all its friends  
The moons the Junes the roses and rainbow's ends  
Down with songs that moan about night and day  
Down with love yes take it away, away  
  
Far away  
So very, very far away  
Give it back to the birds and the bees and especially the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs and down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
Down with love
