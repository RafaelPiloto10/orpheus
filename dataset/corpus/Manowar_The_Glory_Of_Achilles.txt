The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled  
In the hear of the battle, Hector was killed  
See him Patroclus, down in the dust  
Rejoice in his death my aymbol of trust  
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed  
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled  
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire  
With oxen , sheep and two of yours hounds  
Your funeral Pyre high off the ground  
Hector's body dragged three times around  
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre  
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire  
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body  
Until your body is burned  
A prophecy spoken a promise fulfilled  
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed
