My Bonnie lies over the ocean, my Bonnie lies over the sea,  
My Bonnie lies over the ocean, O bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me, to me:  
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
O blow ye winds over the ocean,  
O blow ye winds over the sea.  
O blow ye winds over the ocean,  
And bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
Last night as I lay on my bed,  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The winds have blown over the ocean,  
The winds have blown over the sea,  
The winds have blown over the ocean,  
And brought back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank,  
The height of its contents to see,  
I lit a small match to assist her,  
O Bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
Last night as I lay on my bed,  
I stuck my feet out of the window,  
In the morning the neighbors were dead.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My mother makes beer in the bathtub,  
My father makes synthetic gin,  
My sister makes fudge for a quarter,  
Wouldja believe how the money rolls in?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My mother, she drowned in the bathtub,  
My father, he died from his gin,  
My sister choked on her chocolate,  
My stars, what a fix I am in.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I tried making beer in the bathtub,  
I tried making synthetic gin,  
I tried making fudge for a living,  
Now look at the shape that I'm in.
