Make me whole again, open your eyes  
Taunted by the shadows of your lie  
Cold and far away like you're not even mine  
Undo everything and take me higher  
Never believing what they say 'cause I'm  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I'm not giving in, I want you back  
Holding together by the shards of our past  
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go  
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below  
Over and over in my mind  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I am so lost without my place inside your heart  
I won't survive I need to know you hear me  
Awaken and release my love  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home
