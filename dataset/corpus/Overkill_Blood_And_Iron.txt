Out for blood, take no prisoners  
Out for the kill, and looking for donors.  
As terror strikes, give your life  
We drink your blood, a human sacrifice.  
  
Ahh! Stick in the knife  
Uhh! For blood and iron  
Iron!  
Blood and iron  
  
Thirst for more, our chosen path  
Awake and find the Devil's wrath!  
All those who dare and those who disobey  
Alone you'll find, dead, as yesterday  
  
Ahh! Fight for you life  
For blood and iron  
Iron!  
Blood and iron!!!  
  
All right donors! Donate!!!  
  
Flesh of steel, a legion of donors  
We are one as our blood transfers  
New found power raging through your veins  
Blood metal donors eat! the last remains  
  
For blood!!! And iron!!!
