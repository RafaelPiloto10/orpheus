My body is the only place  
Where we meet anymore  
Thought that I could handle the heartache  
Like I did before  
I remember your warning  
To never mention love  
A little crime of passion  
Is what I'm guilty of  
There were no witnesses  
Just the candlelight  
Glowin' as your sweetness awakened  
Every warm delight  
Show me some mercy  
What a fool I have become  
A little crime of passion  
That's what I'm sufferin' from  
Kisses ago it was so easy  
Dreams we shared together faded to forever  
And I just don't wear despair very well  
I can tell  
Now it's such a painful time  
And I'm too far gone  
Where are all the clever defenses  
I depended on?  
How could I be so crazy  
To believe all the things you say?  
A little crime of passion  
Is takin' my breath away  
Show me some mercy  
What a fool I've become  
A little crime of passion  
That's what I'm sufferin' from  
Baby, oh, just a little crime of passion  
What I'm sufferin' from  
What I'm sufferin' from  
What I'm sufferin' from  
Oh, just a little crime of passion  
Is what I'm sufferin' from
