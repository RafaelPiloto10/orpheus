If you can't stand to lose  
Don't stand in the way.  
Hey don't you think it's time to say?  
Tell her the truth now, don't be afraid.  
Tell her she's the only one  
You can't stand to lose.  
It's alright if you're feelin' like  
There's something that you need to say.  
'Cause the only words that she hasn't heard  
Are the very ones that stand in your way.  
So just let your heart tell her what's on your mind  
Even though you're afraid of what she might find.  
If you can't stand to lose  
Don't stand in the way.  
Hey don't you think it's time to say?  
Tell her the truth now, don't be afraid.  
Tell her she's the only one  
You can't stand to lose.  
Hey don't you think it's time to say?  
Tell her the truth now, don't be afraid.  
Tell her she's the only one  
That you can't stand to lose.
