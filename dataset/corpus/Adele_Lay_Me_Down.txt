[Verse 1]  
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to  
Every part of me, all my words to hold  
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart  
No I'm not gonna do it standing up  
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to  
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies  
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart  
No I'm not gonna do it standing up  
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)  
  
[Bridge]  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)
