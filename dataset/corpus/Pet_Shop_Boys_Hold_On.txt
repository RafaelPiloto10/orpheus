Hold on, hold on,  
There's got to be a future, hold on  
Hold on, hold on,  
There's got to be a future,  
Or the world will end today  
  
The sun will melt away,  
The sky so dark decay  
And summer, spring and autumn, winter  
Melt into a single moment  
Heart into the past,  
Like a stream run trail at last  
  
Hold on, hold on,  
There's got to be a future  
To create and to defend  
So the world can never end, hold on  
Things can be quite so bad  
Than all we have and all we had  
Never worry we won't return,  
Lost in a fire that cannot burn  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,  
There's got to be a future,  
Or the end will end today  
  
Look around, look around  
The rain is falling from the sky  
Planes taking off to fly  
Sweeping bands and barking dogs  
Shopping malls and catalogs  
Traffic start on busy streets  
Lovers line between the sheets  
Business moguls, computer freaks  
Modern artist, new techniques  
Money comes and money goes  
Children cry and still suppose  
  
There's got to be a future, hold on  
Hold on, hold on  
There's got to be a future,  
Or the end will end today  
Hold on, hold on  
There's got to be a future,  
Hold on
