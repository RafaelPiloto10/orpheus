Ha ow ha ow ha ow haaaaaaaaaa baby this is my life  
When I walk out the door I see you baby you are not in my life  
I wanna hold em' like they do in texas plays  
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it)  
Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start  
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his hearti  
Have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
This is my life  
And babe, there's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
There's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
I wish you'd never looked at me that way  
Eh eh, eh eh  
There's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
My my my my life  
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
Don't play too much just as that kid  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
  
Touch me t-touch me baby but don't mess up my hair  
Love me l-love me crazy  
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair  
My life  
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)  
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)  
Vanity (it's so good to be)  
Popular and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else  
Va-va-va-va-vanity va-vanity, va-va-va-vanity  
My life so shut up  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game  
This is my life.
