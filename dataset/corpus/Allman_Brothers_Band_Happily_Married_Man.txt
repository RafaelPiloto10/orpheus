Awwwwww  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Since she left I've been running wild  
Jumping all the women I can  
Gave me some trouble for a little while  
But now I'm back to my old style  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Oh yes I am, and further more  
  
Ain't got no home, no children, no pets  
I'm a happily married man  
When I get tried I just lay down  
I sleep where ever I am  
Now my plate and my pot are gone from my sink  
And I don't have to worry bout taking a drink  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
  
Come on in there you'all  
  
Whooa, now let me get in there  
  
Now my new old lady is outta sight  
I'm a happily married man  
She's a loving me a every day and a every night  
Just as much as she can  
Now I don't have to worry about sleeping pill  
Knives, Guns or doctor bill  
No I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Happily married man  
Parting with you was such a sweet sorrow  
Whooa, awww, come on
