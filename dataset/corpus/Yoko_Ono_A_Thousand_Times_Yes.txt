I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,  
I prayed a thousand times yes.  
And the no that was hanging over the buildings  
Faded like the moon at dawn.  
  
When I was young I thought I was facing  
A very aware world ahead,  
I didn't know it was going to be  
"beware of dogs" instead.  
  
I said no, I said no, I said no,  
I said no a million times to no.  
But the yes that was in its last breath  
Still hovered in a room with a permanent flu.  
  
When I was young I didn't know  
That one can only read life in braille,  
I was still struggling to catch life on its tail.  
  
I said why, I said why, I said why,  
I asked why for the billionth time.  
And my bone slowly lost its moist  
Like a leftover coke bottle on the street.  
  
Yes, this dry whiteness of a thing on the square,  
that's my bone.  
It lets the wind pass over like the last tender fraud,  
Makes a little noise like old campaign billboard.  
  
I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,  
I prayed a thousand times yes.  
And the no that was hanging over faded.
