Someone tell me that I'm wrong  
Someone tell me that I'm right  
Someone tell me where I'm going  
  
I guess it's safe to say  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
  
It makes no sense to me  
  
Someone tell me that it's black  
Someone tell me that it's white  
Someone tell me that it's going to make a difference  
  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
It makes no sense to me
