I'm drifting and drifting,  
Just like a ship out on the sea.  
I'm drifting and drifting,  
Just like a ship out on the sea.  
Well I ain't got nobody  
In this world to care for me.  
  
If my baby  
Would only take me back again.  
If my baby  
Would only take me back again.  
I would feel much better, darling,  
And at least I'd have a friend.  
  
I give you all my money,  
Tell me what more can I do.  
I give you all my money,  
Tell me what more can I do.  
You is a sweet little girl  
But I swear you won't be true.  
  
I'm drifting and drifting,  
Just like a ship out on the sea.  
I'm drifting and drifting,  
Just like a ship out on the sea.  
Because I ain't got nobody  
In this world to care for me.
