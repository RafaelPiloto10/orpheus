Maybe  
Maybe I'm wrong  
To go on thinking, to sing my song  
Maybe  
This world's falling down  
Call up the trumpeters and knock the walls down  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
  
Slowly  
Slowly we walk  
No harm in crying, no sense in talk  
Slowly  
The ice melts away  
Call on the choir to sing  
And turn no-one away  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
  
Maybe  
Maybe I'm wrong  
The river holds it's breath  
The sea will keep it's calm  
Slowly  
Slowly we turn  
A look at where we've been  
The juggler has to learn  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you
