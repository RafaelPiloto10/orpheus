I have picked wild roses  
Far into September  
But I had no one to give the flowers to  
I needed the celebration  
of September coronation  
And I admitted to myself I needed you  
  
I've watched the gentle winds change  
The colored shades of meadows  
I've seen the dillon flowers  
That had no name  
But I let my vase stay empty  
Like my old and empty heart  
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same  
  
Don't you think its come our time to be together  
Lets gather up our scattered words of love  
And make them rhyme  
  
Lets go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases  
  
Don't you think its come our time?  
  
Would you take the small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers  
And the feeling that your love is close at hand  
  
Thank you for the flowers  
Now lets walk through the meadows  
To the road where our divines caress the sand  
  
Don't you think its come our time to be together  
Lets gather up our scattered words of love  
And make them rhyme  
  
Lets go pick some flowers now and fill our empty vases  
  
Don't you think its come our time?  
Don't you think its come our time?
