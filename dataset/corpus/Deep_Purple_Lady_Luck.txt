She was a juke-box dancer  
A blue eyed gypsy queen  
She always had an answer  
For what she'd done  
And where she'd been  
A feathercane Lady Midnight  
For all around to see  
She spoke with words of wisdom  
And this is what she said to me  
  
Lady luck  
C'mon give me what I want  
Pull me up  
Lady luck  
If I see you again  
I will call you my friend  
  
I have always been a sinner  
But then the lady came along  
She stole my heart and turned me 'round  
'Till I didn't know right from wrong  
She whispered words of kindness  
I'd never ever heard before  
Golden words and silver tongue  
Till I really couldn't take no more  
  
Lady luck  
C'mon give me what I want  
Pull me up  
Lady luck  
If I see you again  
I will call you my friend  
C'mon shake me
