People are born to love and be happy  
Living a sunshine  
And a cloudy sky can lead to a rainbow  
Lookin' at life that way  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you're lucky to find a special man  
You gotta love him all you can  
And anything he wants from you  
Should be the least that you can do  
Don't let him down  
Just give him love  
Don't let his dreams turn into dust  
He's only tryin' to build a wonderland for two  
If you're the one to share his world  
Just be the someone he can trust  
For the sake of love  
For the love of love  
For pete's sake  
Don't let him down  
Don't let him down  
  
You can live in a castle  
And dream of your diamonds  
Thinkin' you really walk tall  
But livin' and dreamin' when you're alone  
Ain't livin' or dreamin' at all  
  
(repeat chorus to fade)
