Oh yeah, alright  
Oh yeah, alright  
  
When I met you last night baby  
And you let me roll the dice  
You said I'd be your lucky lady  
I hit those numbers all night  
I can't lose, I can't lose when I'm 'round you  
Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
  
I can turn your luck around baby  
Ain't no hotter hand in town.  
Promise I can make love to you all night  
I bet you never felt this way before  
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor  
Roll with me, I won't bite  
Hands on, I'm going wild  
Oh baby you got to be my axe in the?  
I can't lose, I can't lose when I'm 'round you  
Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night

Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright
