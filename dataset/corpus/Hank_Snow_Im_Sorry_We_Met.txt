Though you have refused  
To see me, my dear  
You'd rather I'd be all alone  
Still I can't forget  
The kisses we knew  
And the days  
When I called you my own  
But you found another  
And you loved him too  
My heart is broken  
I'm sad and I'm blue  
I am sorry we met  
It's so hard to forget  
The days that used to be  
  
But you found another...  
And though you weren't true  
I still think of you  
And your memory's so dear to me  
But you found another...
