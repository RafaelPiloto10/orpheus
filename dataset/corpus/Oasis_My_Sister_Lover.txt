A feeling sleeping deep inside  
You hide it so I'll never find  
Today I think I'll waste my time  
You never notice, you are blind  
The dream I have can never be  
To photograph what the eye can't see  
I fight to live another day  
I live to find out, come what may  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, Your my lover  
Your my lover, Your my lover  
  
She gives me light when the sun goes down  
She gives me strength when I don't drown  
She gives me hope and destiny  
She gives me air that I can breathe  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother
