I take what I want  
An' I steal anything that I need,  
I would do anything  
To get my satisfaction guaranteed  
  
'Cause I'm looking for love,  
The time has come  
I'm looking for love,  
An' I mean to get me some  
I'm looking for love right now,  
An' I'm rough an' ready  
  
All of you woman better  
Lift up your skirts an' run,  
'Cause I aim to shoot my pistol  
An' fire like a Gatlin gun  
  
'Cause I'm looking for love,  
Believe me when I say  
I'm looking for love,  
In the worst kind of way  
I'm looking for love right now  
An' I'm rough an' ready  
  
Rough an' ready  
  
Rough an' ready  
  
I take what I want  
An' I steal anything that I need,  
I would do anything  
To get my satisfaction guaranteed  
  
'Cause I'm looking for love,  
The time has come  
I'm looking for love,  
An' I mean to get me some  
I'm looking for love right now,  
An' I'm rough an' ready  
  
Rough an' ready
