My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
(Hey, What's the words to the next verse?)  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My hanky does my baby baby  
My baby does my hanky hanky  
My baby does my baby baby  
My baby does the hanky panky  
(Oh I don't believe it)  
I saw her walking on down the line  
You know I saw her for the very first time  
A pretty little girl standing all alone  
Hey, pretty baby, can I take you home  
I never saw her, never ever saw her  
(Oh here we go again)  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
(what is that?)  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
I said, my baby she does the hanky panky  
(Can you tell me what the hanky panky is?)  
I saw her walking on down the line  
(Yes I did)  
You know I saw her for the very first time  
A pretty little girl standing all alone  
Hey, pretty baby, can I take you home  
I never saw her, never ever saw her  
(Oh goodness)  
I said ah, My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby she does the hanky panky, now  
My baby does my hanky panky  
My hanky does my panky baby  
My hanky she does the hanky panky  
My baby she does the hanky panky  
My baby she does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky
