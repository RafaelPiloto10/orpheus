Lady have you known me  
The perfect love machine ah  
Virgo, my Leo's rising  
Venus made me king  
That trail of broken hearts  
They all belong to me  
Magic runs through my fingers  
One touch you'll see!!  
  
[Chorus]  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine tonight..tonight  
  
What can I do for you am I your wildest dream  
What do I move in you am I what I seem  
My eyes they lie and you cry  
Love brings you pain  
And if you try to love me  
You'll not feel the same  
  
[Chorus x2]
