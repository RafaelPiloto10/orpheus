Got the blues from my baby  
Left me by the san francisco bay.  
This big ocean liner took her so far away.  
Didn't mean to treat her so bad  
She was the best girl I ever have had.  
She said good-bye, and she made me cry  
I'm gonna lay right down and die.  
Well, I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime.  
If she don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind.  
If she ever comes back to stay,  
Well, that'll be another brand new day,  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay.  
Sittin' in my back door  
Wondering which way to go  
That woman I'm so crazy about  
She don't love me no more.  
Lord, I think I'll grab a freight train  
Because I'm feeling blue,  
Ride all the way to the end of the line  
Thinking only about you.  
Well, meanwhile in another city  
Just about to go insane  
Thought I heard my baby  
The way she used called my name.  
If she ever comin' back to stay  
Well, that'll be another brand new day  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay  
(I really mean it!)  
Oh, walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay, whew!!
