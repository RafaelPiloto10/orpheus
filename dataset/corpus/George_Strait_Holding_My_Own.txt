There are people who don't know me  
Who must think I've got it made  
From all outward appearances  
I guess it looks that way  
I've got good friends and family  
They let me know they care  
I got a job to keep me going  
And a car to get me there  
  
I'm holding my own  
But I'd rather be holding you  
I can make it alone  
But not like I made it with you  
Without you here  
This house just ain't no home  
How long can I go on holding my own  
  
There's brand new show that's playing  
At the movies down the street  
I'll probably go there after work  
Then stop somewhere to eat  
I've got cable on my TV  
And I'll leave her on all night  
While I dose off to sleep  
And dream that I'm alright  
  
I'm holding my own  
But I'd rather be holding you  
I can make it alone  
But not like I made it with you  
Without you here  
This house just ain't no home  
How long can I go on holding my own  
  
How long can I go on holding my own
