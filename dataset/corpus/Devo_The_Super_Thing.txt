Today what does it take to do the super thing  
I'll tell you what it takes a very simple thing  
Iron nerves like the pilot of a jumbo jet  
Or a girl on the go who hasn't got there yet  
  
Magnetic trumpets blowing  
Synthetic saxophone  
The evidence kept growing  
From below  
  
Hidden motivations  
Buried in the past  
Still gives us strength  
For the super thing  
  
The red alarm a rude surprise every time it rings  
Means it's time to go beyond the normal thing  
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right  
The super thing the thing that makes you bigger than life  
Won't you tell me what it takes  
To do the super thing  
  
Signals start to travel from a distant place  
Lights go out electro shock then pleasure pain  
Sensations unfamiliar can make you sick  
It's a superhuman thing and it does the trick
