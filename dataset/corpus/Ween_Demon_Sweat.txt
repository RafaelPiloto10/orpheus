The sky dripped in a demon sweat the night she left  
Wrapped up in a blanket and I'm feelin' wet  
They said she flew from the goals in her life  
Then she wet like blood from a knife  
I'm here, and it's all so clear now  
  
The wind flows and it's blowing cold, and I'm still here  
Gripping onto what's not around  
Now it's all so clear to me now  
Now I know, sometimes I try a bit too hard  
And I can't let go of you  
Boo-boop-dee-doo  
Boo-boo-boop-dee-doo  
Boop-dee-doo
