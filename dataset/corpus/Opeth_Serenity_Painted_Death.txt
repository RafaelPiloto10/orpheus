Returned from a hibernal dream  
Voices fell like marble  
No longer by my side  
Gone all that would linger  
  
Ripped from my embrace  
Melinda reflected in shafts  
Red line round her neck  
Met the earth in silence  
  
White faced, haggard grin  
This serenity painted death  
With a halo of bitter disease  
Black paragon in lingering breath  
  
Saw here fading, blank stare into me  
Clenched fist from the beautiful pain  
  
Darkness reared its head  
Tearing within the reeling haze  
Took control, claiming my flesh  
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum  
  
Each and every one would die at my hand  
Choking in warm ponds of blood  
At last, weak and torn, I went down  
Drained from strength, flickering breath  
  
Came with the moon  
The wayward in conscious state  
Flanked and barred in destiny's end  
Underneath with hope in laches  
  
Swathed in filth, any would betoken  
Starlit shadows on the wall  
Finally there to collect me  
From the bowels of sin
