You ask me how the flowers grow  
And what makes the glow worm glow  
How high is the sky, how long is forever  
  
You want to know how any corn small  
Grows to be a tree so tall  
How deep is a sigh, how long is forever  
  
Oh, all your little funny ways  
I just can't ignore  
All the foolish things you say  
Make me love you more  
  
You ask me if, if my love is true  
Here's the answer I give you  
I'll be at your side as long as forever  
  
Oh, all your little funny ways  
I just can't ignore  
All the foolish things you say  
Make me love you more, forever
