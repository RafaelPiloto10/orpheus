Love never doubts or suffers or cries  
Love shows no fear, love tells no lies  
And love will never leave me in the dark  
No, love never breaks my heart  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Love doesn't have unapproachable walls  
Or a heart that beckons and then withdraws  
And love would never steal my dignity  
Love has never made a fool of me  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Oh, and I have known times  
When love seems unsure  
But when love is unkind  
It is not love anymore  
  
Love never threatens of frightens me  
It's not held together with apologies  
Love never screams my name  
No, and love never turns away  
Like you do, like you do  
  
And I have known times  
When love seems unsure  
But when love maybe unkind  
Love never turns away  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Like you do, like you do
