Did you know  
All my reserve was just pretend?  
Did you know  
I was only posin? as your friend?  
Did you know?  
Did my eyes play on your face too long?  
Did they say how much I needed you?  
Did the words I try to say in jest  
Seem to come out soundin? much too true?  
Did you know  
Could you see through my disguise?  
Did you know  
Or does my love come as a surprise?  
Did you know?  
I can't believe you haven't guessed  
They was much too much coincidence  
All those times we met by chance  
All where my un-purpose accidents  
Did you know?  
Doesn't matter anyway  
Did you know  
Someone else has said the things?  
I want to say  
So I?ll go, I never should have waited 'round  
In hopes that you would finally see  
But in case I get a second chance  
Now you know just what you mean to me  
Did you know?
