I dream of a place that's hedged with roses  
With a man in the middle don't talk in riddles  
You get hung on every single word  
Some call it high, some call it low  
  
And I hear about things you don't want to know  
But the truth is still a valuable thing  
Don't get caught with your pants down baby  
This world the criminal sing  
  
There is another world waiting  
But anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
  
You can hide your face  
Pull it into shades  
'Cause you can't escape the lie forever  
I dream of a place that's overrun by children  
  
And the lord is in the kitchen  
Do your work and you'll get your rewards  
'Cause what you are is all that really matters  
What is left you can easily scatter  
  
On the ground a head covered in mud  
Don't step on my principles baby  
In spite of what you have done  
One day you will have the wisdom  
  
I will tell you  
Everything straight  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
You can hide your face  
  
You can change your shape  
'Cause you can escape the lie forever  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell
