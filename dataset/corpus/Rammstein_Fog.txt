They stand with their arms tightly around each other  
A mixture of flesh, so rich in days  
Where the sea touches the land  
She wants to tell him the truth  
But the wind eats her words  
Where the sea ends  
She holds his hand, trembling  
And kissed him on the forehead  
She carries the evening in her chest  
And knows that she must wither away  
She lays her head in his lap  
And asks for a last kiss  
And then he kissed her  
Where the sea ends  
Her lips, delicate and pale  
And his eyes tear up  
The last kiss was so long ago  
The last kiss  
He does not remember it anymore
