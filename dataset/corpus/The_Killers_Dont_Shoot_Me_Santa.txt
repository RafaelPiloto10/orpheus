Oh, Santa  
I've been waiting on you  
That's funny kid  
Because I've been coming for you  
Oh, Santa  
I've been killing just for fun  
Well, the party is over kid  
Because I, because I got a bullet in my gun  
A bullet in your what  
(Santa's got a bullet in his gun, you know it)  
(Santa's got a bullet in his gun)  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
Oh, Santa  
It's been a real hard year  
There just ain't no getting around this  
Life is hard but look at me I turned out alright  
Hey, Santa  
Why don't we talk about it, work it out  
Believe me, this ain't what I wanted  
I love all you kids, you know that, hell  
I remember when you were just 10 years old  
Playing out in the desert  
Just waiting for a sip of that  
Sweet Mojave rain  
In the sweet Mojave rain  
The boy was on his own  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through  
Hey, Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
They had it coming, so, why can't you see  
I couldn't turn my check no longer  
The sun is going down and Christmas is near  
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the street they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
Believe me Santa, Santa
