Sadness slips in to the room  
On silent steps of sorrow  
Stealing sleep and all my dreams  
Where will we be tomorrow  
Lying with you  
Crying with you  
Drifting  
Talking till dawn  
Yet we go on  
Drifting  
Don't understand where we begin  
Just drifting apart  
Drifting apart  
Feeling alone  
Drifting away  
  
We can't seem to work it out  
Drifting from day to day  
What is it all about  
Drifting away  
Drifting away  
Drifting away  
Losing the feeling  
And now the music of this song is almost done  
And we used to play  
From sweet surrender  
To drifting away  
Drifting  
  
Two lovers lost  
Two rivers crossed  
Drifting,  
Two bridges burned  
No lessons learned  
Drifting  
  
Lonely together  
Hurting each other  
Still we can't say that it is over  
Can't we bring back yesterday  
  
Will we will be forever  
Forever drifting away  
Drifting  
Drifting away
