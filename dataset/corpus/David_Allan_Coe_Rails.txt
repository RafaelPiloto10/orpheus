Hey, lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
I've spent most of my life in honest thinking  
And I never cared too much for serious drinking  
Marijuana makes my eyes start blinking  
And incense make my sinuses drain  
  
So, lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
Now women make me think of consolation  
Prison makes me think of isolation  
Niggers made me vote for segregation  
And cocaine makes me hard as a rock  
  
So, lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
Well it's hard to work for a dollar a week  
And the Ku Klux Klan is bigger  
So take the sheets of of your bed  
And let's go hang a nigger  
  
And lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned
