Heart  
I know I've been hard on you  
I'm sorry for the things I put you through  
Before you start to break on me  
Or ask for sympathy  
I need to make you see  
  
Oh heart  
I'm not sure it's been long enough  
To say what I feel is really love  
There is just one way to learn  
Sometimes we'll get hurt  
And right not it's our turn  
  
Give it time  
Help me through  
Heart we can do this together  
  
You're my strength  
You're my soul  
I need you now more than ever  
  
Heart  
All the hurt will soon be gone  
If you, if you'll just keep on being strong  
You will always be my friend  
So keep on hanging in  
And we'll find love again  
  
Give it time  
Help me through  
Heart we can do this together  
  
You're my strength  
You're my soul  
I need you now more than ever  
  
Heart  
I know I've been hard on you  
I'm sorry for the things I've put you through  
Please don't you break on me  
I need to make you see  
It wasn't meant to be  
'Cause you will always be my friend  
So keep on hanging in  
And we'll find love again

"So Amanda, whatcha guys do on your date last night?"  
"Oh he was so sweet. He took me to eat and brought me roses." (Aw..)  
"And then we went back to his house and watched movies."  
"You went back to his house?"  
  
"Did you guys kiss?"  
"I'm not telling you that!" (laughter)  
"Oh my god, you did!"  
"Shhh...oh my god."  
  
"Look at that guy."  
"He's so cute."  
"And he's looking over here."  
"Be quiet. Gotta be cool."  
  
"Go talk to him."  
"No...I'm too nervous."
