Sometimes I wonder if everything changed,  
How could we make out?  
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed,  
There's this big dark cloud  
Hovering  
  
Hovering, hovering, hovering  
You always said that we'd make it through  
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
We go through the motions like everything's settled,  
But it's inside out  
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on  
When there's all this doubt  
Hovering  
  
Hovering, hovering, hovering  
You always said that we'd make it through  
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
And maybe we're just older,  
Just a little older  
'cause the fact that this is over.  
The fact that this is over with you's been  
  
Hovering, stumbling, fumbling.  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
You always said we'd make it through,  
You always said we'd make it through
