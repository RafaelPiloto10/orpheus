We sleep together, close and warm  
We calm each other through the storm  
We set up home, but in a while  
We're tempted by another's smile  
When it's all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We dance around the fading light  
You hold me closer every night  
You fell in love but I did not  
But in the end you're all I've got  
When it's all played out  
When the truth is known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We fly around the world too fast  
We cannot make one moment last  
We love the crowd, we sing and play  
We do it all, we get our way  
When it's all played out  
When the bird has flown  
You have to learn to live alone  
When we're all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone
