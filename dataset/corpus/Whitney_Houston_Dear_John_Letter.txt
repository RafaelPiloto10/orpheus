I'm sitting here,  
In my own head thinking  
How you could be staring in  
Got my number too  
And I'm writing you  
Contemplating on the paper what I should do  
On the fireplace with the mail man  
Should I tell you or should I hold it in  
If my heart wasn't in it  
Baby you could just forget it  
I'd be gone in a New York minute  
  
You never give me attention  
I know you never had bad intentions for us  
So I'm writing you but I always fail to mention  
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss  
So I'm gonna hold it in  
  
[Chorus]  
(I'm writing you a) Dear John letter  
I tried to stay but it never got better  
I couldn't tell you face to face but I,  
I had to let you know  
Sometimes I want to hit the door  
(I'm writing you Dear John)  
Sometimes I think that I've had enough  
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough,  
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks,  
You know I'm listening  
Some days I'm really touchy and  
Some days I'm willing to forget and  
Some days I'm still in love with you  
Some days I'm sad and blue  
  
When I don't check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I know that it's not just you  
It's some of my negligence too  
And I can't go through with mailing this to you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When I don't check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I know that it's not just you  
It's some of my negligence too  
And I can't go through with mailing this to you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm writing this letter  
Because it makes me feel better
