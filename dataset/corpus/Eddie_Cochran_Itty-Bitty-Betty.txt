Well Itty-Bitty-Betty got some rockin' shoes  
Well she's gonna rock away all her blues  
Well she's a-gonna make it to the record hop  
And when she starts a-dancin', man she ain't gonna stop  
Well Itty-Bitty-Betty she just loves to dance  
When she starts a-swingin', man you ain't got a chance  
Itty-Bitty-Betty loves the record hops  
Well your toes will be a-poppin' right through your socks  
Well now Itty-Bitty-Betty, just a-watch her go  
And when you rock with Betty don't you rock too slow  
She'll rock you to the left and she'll rock you to the right  
If you see bitty Betty you better duck out of sight
