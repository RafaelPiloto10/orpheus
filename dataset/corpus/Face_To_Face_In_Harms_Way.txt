Where did you go? so far away it seems like everybody tried to tell you
everything and who are you? who are they? seems like everybody wants to give
themselves away three days old anway so you're tired and the inspiration's
gone away where are you? in harm's way seems like everything is broken and it
feels like I might break on this ordinary day why do we need to change? when
we were perfect yesterday? having trouble comprehending I was sure that I was
who I thought I was and if you want the truth then I blame them I blame you
and I blame myself in all this pomp and circumstance I failed to see that I
had missed my chance without a word to say I waited as you turned and walked
away
