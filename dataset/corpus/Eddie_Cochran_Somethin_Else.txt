A look a-there, here she comes  
There comes that girl again  
Wanted to date her since I don't know when  
But she don't notice me when I pass  
She goes with all the guys from outa my class  
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself  
She's sure fine-lookin' man, she's something else  
  
Hey, look a-there, across the street  
There's a car made just for me  
To own that car would be a luxury  
But my dollar can't afford the gas  
A brand new convertible is outa my class  
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself  
That car's fine-lookin' man, it's something else  
  
Hey, look a-here, just wait and see  
Worked hard and saved my dough  
I'll buy that car that I been wanting so  
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around  
We'll look real sharp with the flight top down  
I keep right on a-dreamin' and a-thinkin' to myself  
When it all comes true man, wow, that's something else  
  
Look a-there, what's all this  
Never thought I'd do this before  
But here I am a-knockin' on her door  
My car's out front and it's all mine  
Just a forty-one Ford, not a fifty-nine  
I got that girl an' I'm a-thinkin' to myself  
She's sure fine-lookin' man, wow, she's something else
