Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
  
Reach over and feel the pillow, baby  
Where your sweet man used to lay  
  
Well baby, it's so lonesome by myself  
Well, it's so lonesome, baby, just sleeping all by myself  
Well, I don't want nobody but my baby  
Shouting, my baby's loving somebody else  
  
Oh baby, won't you please hear my plea?  
Hallelujah, I said, oh, oh baby, won't you please hear my plea?  
Well, wherever you may be, darling  
Bring your fine self home to me
