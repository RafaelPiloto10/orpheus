When I'm with you a chain reaction  
Like a rush of satisfaction  
Suddenly coming over me  
  
Your eyes telling me that you hold the key  
The key to unlock my fantasies  
Baby this is where I want to be  
  
My heart is beating so hard it's frightening  
Feels like I'm hit by lightening  
Every time I watch you move  
  
You're so in tune with your body  
And I can see that no one else will do  
Cause I'm so into you  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, just can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore  
  
You can take care of my affliction  
Satisfy my addiction  
You know what you have to do  
When your body wants my affliction  
You take me in a new direction  
One where there's only you and me  
  
And then we reise to the moment  
And I can feel your love all around me  
Now it's time to give it all  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, just can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore  
  
Just one look in your eyes and  
I'm in heaven  
There's so much that  
I want I go insane  
Take me here, make me yours now and forever  
I can take all the pleasure and the pain  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, I can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, oh oh oh  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one, one that I adore  
  
Alabao  
Alabao  
Alabao  
Alabao
