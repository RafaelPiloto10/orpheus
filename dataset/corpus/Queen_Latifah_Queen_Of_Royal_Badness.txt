Let me remind you on how to unwind your body  
So dance and shake and just keep in step  
Understand, draw a clear picture  
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def  
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom  
All competitors, I simply cream them  
One by one, I dust a rush them all  
If you have any more, bring them  
To the front so they can sho me what they got  
What they got, it better be hot  
Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box  
And they'll be put in a spot  
The style I use will surely amuse  
The party people to a state of gladness  
What I mean is I'm on the scene  
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H  
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates  
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise  
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys  
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking  
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking  
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred  
When you address me, address me as "Your Highness"  
One of hip-hop's finest  
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo  
It makes me no difference  
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me  
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?  
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic  
And draw attractions  
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles  
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them  
The result with a pen and a pad  
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
I can't wait until the party is jam-packed  
When I start to drop it, the people say "Damn, black"  
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly  
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be  
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell  
Guard as well as you can or step  
Off the premisis, in one minute it's  
Going to explode in a style that's limitless  
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move  
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool  
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss  
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust  
Literature that flows like liquid  
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it  
So don't say nothing  
Just listen up, follow instructions  
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said  
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads  
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands  
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams  
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery  
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me  
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this  
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness
