Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
Poor baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my craddle  
Till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
From thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with thee there.
