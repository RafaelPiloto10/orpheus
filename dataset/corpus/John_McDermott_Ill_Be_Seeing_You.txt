Ill be seeing you,  
In all the old, familiar places,  
That this heart of mine embraces,  
All day through.  
  
In that small cafe,  
The park across the way,  
The children's carousel,  
The chestnut tree,  
The wishing well.  
  
Ill be seeing you,  
In every lovely, summers day,  
And everything that's bright and gay,  
Ill always think of you that way,  
Ill find you in the morning sun,  
And when the night is new,  
Ill be looking at the moon,  
But I'll be seeing you.
