Tonight do me a favor  
On your way to do me wrong  
Drop me at a honky tonk  
Don't leave me here alone  
I washed and waxed the car today  
I even filled the tank  
If you're gonna drive me crazy  
Drive me to drink  
  
All the mothers and your lovers  
Will be happy I suppose  
You'll be in his arms again  
And I'll be off the road  
The highway will be safer  
And they'll have you to thank  
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
You're in the driver's seat  
It's all up to you  
I'll be your dedicated man  
Or your designated fool  
  
But if you're hell-bent  
And bound to bolt  
I can't change the way you think  
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
You're in the driver's seat  
It's all up to you  
I'll be your dedicated man  
Or your designated fool  
  
But if you're hell-bent  
And bound to bolt  
I can't change the way you think  
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby  
Drive me to drink  
  
Well if you're gonna drive me crazy, baby  
Drive me to drink
