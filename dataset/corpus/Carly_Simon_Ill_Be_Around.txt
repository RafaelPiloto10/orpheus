I'll be around  
No matter how you treat me now  
I'll be around  
When she's gone  
Your latest love  
Will never last  
And when it's past  
I'll be around when she's gone  
  
Goodbye again  
And if you find a love like mine  
Just now and then  
Drop a line to say (that) you're feeling fine  
  
And when things go wrong  
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
And I'll be around when she's gone  
  
I'll be around  
When she's gone
