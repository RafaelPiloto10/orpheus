It only took a moment  
A solitary glance  
And I could hear the voice of rapture call  
I've loved you from a distance  
Afraid to take a chance  
But now it seems I cant't help but to fall  
  
Imagine my surprise  
To open my eyes  
And find that you were looking back  
  
And suddenly  
I cannot remember who I used to be  
Like the rain this yearning washes over me  
And all the pain I knew before is gone  
Yeah, suddenly  
I'm no longer drifting on a empty sea  
Now I know that I believe in destiny  
And mine is waiting right here in your arms  
  
I long to wake beside you  
And battle in loves abyss  
Washing all that's come before away  
And in that frozen moment  
As I receive your kiss  
There will not be enough words to say  
  
I wanna make you melt  
Touch you like no one else  
And do it all again a thousand times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna make you melt  
Touch you like no one else  
And do it all again a thousand times  
  
[Chorus]
