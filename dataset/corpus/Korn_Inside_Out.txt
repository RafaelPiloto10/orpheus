I like the way you're so fucked up  
Naked and wearing no makeup  
I watch your pulse beneath your skin  
Sometimes I wish I could crawl in  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
I like the way your ''ribs'' contract  
When you are lying on your back  
The ''bruises you internalize'' eternalize  
The thoughts behind those crazy eyes  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art  
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
I drink the milk that's in your breast  
I wouldn't even mind your shit  
I put my tounge inside your ear  
I'm gonna eat you up right here  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out
