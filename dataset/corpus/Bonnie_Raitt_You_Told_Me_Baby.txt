Told me baby  
You were just too tired to try  
There was nothing left for you to give  
And no more tears to cry  
I know she hurt you  
But you know I've been hurt too  
You just come to me  
We'll see what a love can do  
Told me baby  
I was still too young to know  
All the ways that love was going  
To drag you down and just how low I'd go  
In love and time between us  
Makes no difference at all  
You know, you're as desperate to get back up  
As I am not to fall  
Oh, baby, I've been looking for a man like you  
Oh, darling, after all we've been through  
There's no one left to fool, nothing left for us to do  
Except me and you  
Told me baby  
To find somebody new  
Do you really think that I'd come this far  
Just to lose a man like you?  
You know you've got to take a chance  
If only you will stay  
And if you've got the time baby, I've got the love  
We might just find a way  
We might just find a way, yeah  
We might just find a way, yeah  
We might just find a way, ooh
