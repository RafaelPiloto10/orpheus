Sherry's living in paradise  
Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach  
And you know she came here from LA.  
Southern California could not hold her dreams  
She's happy now it seems  
  
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise  
Chasing something or running from something  
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing  
And she's thought about leaving once or twice  
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life  
Sherry's living in paradise  
  
Sherry's living in paradise  
Somehow the salty air, it soothes her soul  
Says it makes her whole  
She gets hit on by the tourists  
But she brushes it off 'cause she's heard every line  
She just takes it in stride  
  
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise  
Chasing something or running from something  
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing  
And she's thought about leaving once or twice  
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life  
Sherry's living in paradise  
  
She's thought about leaving once or twice
