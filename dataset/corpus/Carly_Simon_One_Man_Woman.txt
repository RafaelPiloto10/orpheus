Well it's plain as rain  
And it's there for all the world to see  
Just 'cause everybody does it  
That doesn't make it right for me  
Someone is making plans  
Involvin' my old man  
Everytime I turn by back around  
Feelin' like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Now the place I come from  
People don't grow on trees  
And you can't treat people like meat  
Without getting brought to your knees  
Now and then  
The way I've been feeling  
Since I hit this town  
Like to jump in the river and drown  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Sometimes I'd like  
To get out on the floor  
Shake it till dawn  
Some young thing  
Like to teach him the bump  
Make me want to take him home  
Well excuse me  
I don't mean to preach no lectures  
Yeah but me and my man won't  
Be able to stay for breakfast  
I guess he's got the itch  
And I'm just a bitch  
Who's trying to bring him down  
  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Acting like a one man woman  
I guess I'm just a one man woman
