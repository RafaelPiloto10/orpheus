She had a look in her eye that could make you melt,  
Made me feel better than I ever felt.  
But bless her heart, she couldn't stay,  
I begged her not to go away.  
She left my ex best friend out in old Tucson,  
Told me she was leavin' and would be rollin on.  
Now the days just pass on by,  
Losin' her is the reason why.  
Leila, Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright.  
  
You know I love you girl more than I can say,  
I still think about you each and every day.  
My lonesome old heart still feels the same,  
So Leila won't you steal away.  
Leila, Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright.  
  
Leila, Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright.
