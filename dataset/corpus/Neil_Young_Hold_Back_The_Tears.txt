Hello, my old friend.  
It's good to see you smiling.  
You've been around so long, you must be strong.  
And single life really has its fine points,  
Like friends to help you out when things go wrong.  
  
Hold back the tears  
That you've been cryin'.  
Push off the fears  
When they come around.  
  
Hold back the tears,  
And keep on trying.  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love.  
  
Two lying fools,  
And then four cryin' eyes,  
Counting on one another to survive.  
Crazy love must surely have this pain,  
If getting up means going down again.  
  
Hold back the tears  
That you've been cryin'.  
Push off the fears  
When they come around.  
  
Hold back the tears,  
And keep on trying.  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love.
