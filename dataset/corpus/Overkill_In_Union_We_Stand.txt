From the islands to the cities, from the ports into the sea.  
We are strong, we will always be...  
Blazing through the wreckage, burning all we see...  
The life we lead, committed to be free...  
  
Our union is a fortress!  
Together we are bound.  
A common bound in freedom, and in sound!!!  
So raise your voices high!  
  
For miles around to hear.  
Let them know, we are drawing near...  
  
In union we stand,  
As they! blaze across the land!!!  
In union, we make a final stand...  
  
A peaceful co-existence, is droping out of sight.  
So band together, together we will fight.  
Blasting the resistance, marching to the top.  
They started this, we say when it stops.  
  
Strike fear within their hearts!  
Strike down those in your way.  
Let them know, that we live, today!!!  
They throw us into flames,  
  
Did not hear our cries.  
But now, from the ashes we arise...
