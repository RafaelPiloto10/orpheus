Time is the only thing certain  
When your staring down your son  
And your days will not be forgotten  
If you live them as they come  
When nobody wants to be just your best friend  
Without competition  
With nothing to hide  
Watching your back doubles up your vision  
I make no decisions with unsteady eyes  
  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
This world was never free for me  
But it will be for you  
Listen true  
When you fall  
Get up again  
I know this life might be hard to live  
But It's not for me my love  
It's all for you  
  
I tired to vanish  
Into the shadows  
I tired to get away from it all  
I couldn't manage  
Imagine this life  
With nothing to leave you at all  
Then somebody picked me up  
With the quickness  
Wrapped me in blankets  
Of patience and love  
Brought me back from a broken existence  
I feel no resistance to rising above  
  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
I'll tell you true  
This world was never free for me  
But it will be for you  
That's what I'll do  
If you fall get up again  
I know that life might be hard to live  
But it's not for me anymore  
It's all for you  
  
You know it's not for me  
Oh no no  
Not for me  
Oh no no  
I know it's not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
  
Not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
  
And when you fall get up one more time  
This life is yours for the taking  
Not mine  
Don't be afraid where you came from  
Oh, man  
You'll take it somewhere new  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
You know it's all for you  
  
If you fall get up again  
I know this life can be hard to live  
If you got love  
You should give love  
Get back love  
Take it home with you  
It's not for me, my love  
It's just for you
