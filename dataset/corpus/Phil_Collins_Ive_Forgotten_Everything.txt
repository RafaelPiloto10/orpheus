'I get along without you very well' (Hoagy Carmichael. 1939)  
  
I've forgotten everything about you  
'Til someone says your name  
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you  
'Til someone tells me that you rang  
  
The memories are hazy now  
I don't recall at all  
There's nothing, there's nothing there  
Just me  
And I don't understand why  
  
I can't recollect my feelings  
'Til someone mentions that they saw you  
I really don't remember all the things you said  
'Til someone shows me where you live  
  
Why is everything so hazy now  
I don't recall at all  
There's nothing, there's nothing there  
Just me  
And I don't understand why  
  
I can't recall your smile  
The touch of your hand holding mine  
And I can't remember why  
Holding you seemed so right  
  
The memories they're hazy now  
I don't recall at all  
There's nothing, there's nothing there  
Just me  
And I don't understand why  
  
I've forgotten everything about you  
'Til someone says your name  
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you  
'Til someone tells me that you rang
