It's 6:05 on Sunday mornin'  
And I was supposed to've left for Memphis late last night  
But I stopped at one of them old highway places  
And 'cause I did I'll sleep in Tarren County Jail tonight  
  
Well I started out tonight with good intentions  
But I ended up gettin' sidways drinkin' wine  
Well the last thing I remember we was rollin'  
And something hit my head and knocked me from my conscious mind  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm a victim of life's circumstances  
Well I was raised around bar rooms and Friday night dances  
Singin' them old country songs  
And half the time ending up some place I don't belong  
  
I said, "Jailer, hey, what y'all got me charged with?"  
Well he looked at me and halfway closed one eye  
Well he said, "To mean to say you don't remember  
Cuttin' up some fool with that bone handled knife?"  
  
[Chorus: x2]
