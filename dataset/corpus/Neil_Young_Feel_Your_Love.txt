High on a balcony,  
Right where we used to be,  
This city dancing  
Like a sparkling sea.  
I wanna catch a wave,  
I wanna swim to shore.  
Walk on that same beach  
Like I did before.  
  
I really want the sun,  
Want the sun to rise,  
I really want  
To end the night.  
I really wanna feel,  
Wanna feel your love.  
I wanna feel your love.  
  
I think of our old friends,  
I count my enemies.  
I hear you tell me how  
I don't know love.  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna lay right down.  
Wish I was swimming  
In the sound of love.  
  
I really want the night,  
Want the night to end.  
I really want  
The sun to rise.  
I really wanna feel,  
Wanna feel your love.  
I wanna feel your love.  
  
And now the night is still,  
The mansion on the hill,  
The children sleeping  
In their endless dreams.  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
Feel your love,  
Feel your love.  
  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
Feel your love,  
Feel your love.
