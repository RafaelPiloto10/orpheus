[Verse 1]  
Never ending symptoms in my head  
We lay hollow in the emptiness  
I'm too tired to push you from the bed  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No more fighting, no more fighting  
No more fighting for us  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh, we don't bend or break it  
The space between is deafening  
The space between is deafening  
  
[Verse 2]  
No one's moving, we lack the courage to  
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would  
But we're too tired, we're at the ember's core  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No more fighting, there's no more fighting  
There's no more fighting for us  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh, we don't bend or break it  
The space between is deafening  
  
[Bridge]  
No more fighting, we've given up now  
Silence has more than worth  
Imagination cures loneliness  
When you become a prisoner  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the void in our bed  
The space between is deafening  
Oh, we don't bend or break it  
The space between is deafening
