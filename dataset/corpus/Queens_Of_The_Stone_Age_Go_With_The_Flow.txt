She said "I'll throw myself away,  
They're just photos after all"  
I can't make you hang around.  
I can't wash you off my skin.  
Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out  
You won't remember anyway  
I can go with the flow  
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head?  
It's so safe to play along  
Little soldiers in a row  
Falling in and out of love  
With something sweet to throw away.  
But I want something good to die for  
To make it beautiful to live.  
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate.  
Do you believe it in your head?  
I can go with the flow  
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head?
