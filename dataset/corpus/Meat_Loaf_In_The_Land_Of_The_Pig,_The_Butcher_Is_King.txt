Look at them now  
What do they want?  
And what do they do now?  
Nothing at all!  
  
What do they know?  
What do they think?  
And who do they tell?  
Well, no one at all!  
  
Lives are truly meaningless  
And we are busy being blessed  
  
With that we can take and pocket  
No one needs to know  
We're is the plug and they're the socket  
Give us the juice and we'll go  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
How do they sleep?  
Their lives are so tart  
Bring me the trash collectors  
'Cause they're nothing but trash  
  
What do you expect?  
They've got no standards  
So we lower the bar  
'Cause they're waiting for us  
  
We'll open up Pandora's Box  
Pandora gave her keys and locks  
  
They're the big dogs waiting for their mother  
Come to the confessional  
So I can tell you all to bugger off  
There's no time like now!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the market-place sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king...  
  
And we'll do it our way  
It's our time to play  
We know what to say  
They stand in our way  
Don't stand in our way  
No time like today  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the anthems we sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the chosen ones sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!
