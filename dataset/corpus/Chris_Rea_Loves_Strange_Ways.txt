When passion shines her blinding light on you  
You know my friend there's nothing that you can really do  
Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze  
Down, to love's strange ways  
  
Drowning in a laughter as you go  
Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low  
Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new  
Laugh along you fool, can't you they're laughing at you  
Lost in the haze  
Of love's strange ways  
  
Ain't it funny how it turns  
When it's all over, nothing's learned  
Just a passion and a fool  
And a memory that burns  
And that's what you get  
When you play with love's strange ways
