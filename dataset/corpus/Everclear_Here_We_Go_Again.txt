You know I like to watch you sleep  
No I don't want to touch you  
You'll get mad at me  
No I don't want to think  
About the bad times  
Anyone could have a bad year.  
  
Now I don't want you to show me  
I do not want you to know me  
The way I used to be  
All these good things we have  
Would not mean a damn to me  
  
And I don't want to hear those words  
You feel you have to say  
When you find out how I used to be  
Back in the day  
  
Yeah, you know  
I like the way you slide  
Yeah, yes I like it when  
You do that slow glide  
Please don't bad talk all those good times  
Don't ask around cause baby  
That you do not want to hear  
  
I don't want you to make me  
Do not need you to break me  
Of all my childish ways  
I'm still the same you know  
Dumb, rock hard and good to go  
I still hear them voices calling me  
From back in the day  
  
Oh baby can't you see  
There ain't no place I'd rather be  
Then watching dirty movies  
In that happy room with you  
Sitting on that mattress in the corner  
Eating Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Ooh now here we go again  
  
I know you like the way I rock  
Sometimes I just need to drown out  
All that bad talk  
Yeah, I could not care less  
What your friends say  
Someone's always talking shit  
About the old days  
  
You do not need to remind me  
That I left it all behind  
Things I used to do  
I don't want that other life  
Cause I am so in love with you  
I can barely hear it calling me  
From back in the day  
  
Oh baby can't you see  
There ain't no place I'd rather be  
Then watching dirty movies  
In that happy room with you  
Sitting on that mattress in the corner  
Eating Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Yeah here we go again  
Oh baby here we go again  
Baby baby can't you see  
  
Yes I know you got some doubts  
I know you don't believe  
I know you think I'm crazy  
And I know you're just like me  
When I hear that voice inside me  
Makes me want to jump right in  
Saying here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go again  
  
Let's go watch some dirty movies  
Yes in that nasty little room  
Sit on that mattress while  
We eat that greasy Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Ooh baby here we go again
