I bring it up  
You're quick to cover it all up again  
Thought we were friends  
What are friends for?  
The old bones in your closet  
Must really embarrass you  
And so to save face  
It's a locked place  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't see why you don't get naked with me  
Get all the little secrets out in the open air  
'Cause we won't ever be  
All that we could be  
  
As long as you won't get naked with me  
The future's gettin' shaky  
From all this holdin' back  
  
There's something in your past  
That seems to haunt you  
For better or for worse, I said  
  
I meant it through and through  
No one has ever loved you  
More than I do  
  
[Chorus]
