These are your good years  
Don't take my advice  
You never wanted the nice boys anyway  
And I'm of good cheer  
Cause I've been checking my list  
The gifts you're receiving from me  
Will be  
  
One awkward silence  
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
And all I want this year is for you to dedicate your last breath to me  
Before you bury yourself alive  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Happy new years baby  
You owe me the best gift I will ever ask for  
Don't call me up, when the snow comes down  
It's the only thing I want this year  
  
One awkward silence  
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
All I want this year is for you to dedicate your last breathe to me  
Before you bury yourself alive  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree (don't come home for Christmas)  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree (don't come home for Christmas)  
Merry Christmas, I could care less
