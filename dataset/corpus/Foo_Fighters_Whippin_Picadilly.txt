(this isn't a foo fighters song, it's by gomez)  
Once apon a time,  
Not too long ago,  
We took a day out in Manchester,  
We all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
Played a bit of football,  
Fell into the union,  
Barged our way into the toilets,  
With the kung foo king,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
  
I remember seeing someone  
Dressed in a suit,  
Looking like a lunatic,  
And we all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our trip.  
Well, academy cartwheels  
Breakin' your hands,  
We got lovely posters for sale,  
And we all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share,  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share.  
  
Finally made our way,  
Back to the train,  
Rollin' into Sheffield tonight,  
We all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our life,  
Try and lose my way  
And wait at the station,  
We're whippin' Picadilly tonight,  
And it all falls down,  
Theres not enough hours in our life.  
  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share,  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share.
