Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
It's not the way I had him pictured  
Santa was much too thin  
  
[Chorus]  
He didn't come down the chimney  
So mama must have let him in  
Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
  
Well, they thought I was fast-a-sleppin'  
They thought that I was tucked in his bed  
They never thought I'd come a-peepin'  
Or that I'd hear what was said  
  
Santa put his arm around mama  
And mama put her arm around him  
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy  
Well then I'm a gonna tell on them  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never saw Dancer or Prancer  
I never heard the sleigh bells ring  
I never saw a red-nosed reindeer  
Like they show on the TV screen  
  
But he sure brought lots of presents  
So Santa Claus he must have been  
Well he sure looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
  
[Chorus]
