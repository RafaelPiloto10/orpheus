One, two, one, two, three, four!  
  
There's no peace. Only war  
Victory decides who's wrong or right  
It will not cease. Only grow  
You better be prepared to fight!  
  
And it will not apologize  
For laying down your life  
  
War!  
  
There's no pain. It will spare  
Death has become your only right  
And once you're lost  
In your despair  
Forever black, eternal light  
  
And it will not apologize  
For laying down your life  
  
War!  
Destroyer!  
  
War!  
Destroyer!  
  
It needs no side to justify  
Laying down your life  
  
War!  
Destroyer!  
  
War!
