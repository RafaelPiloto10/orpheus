Down all the days  
Though the past is just a blink away,  
The future waits for me and you,  
Down all the days to 1992  
  
Here is hope for all the people  
And generations yet to come,  
An the future's bright tomorrow,  
Illuminated by the morning sun.  
Here's for all the working people  
And me the ordinary man  
For assembly workers in the factory  
For farmers toiling on the land  
  
Down all the days  
All nations will unite as one  
A new horizon clear to view  
Down all the days to 1992  
  
So lonely on this island ever since she set me free.  
Breaking out of my isolation  
Reaching out with hands across the sea  
Down all the days, down all the days  
  
Hello my celt and gaelic ladies.  
Bonsoir my green colleen from ireland  
Wilkommen deutch and dutch and dansk  
Gutten tag amour prego ola combien  
  
I'm losing all my bitterness  
It's time to find some happiness  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea  
Down all the days  
  
Bon soir, my little senorita, c'est magnifique  
Au revoir, my little fraulfin baby, it's so tragique  
Achtung parlez vous englese, bon appetit  
Jawohl, mambo italiano, ca va, o.k. i'm on my way  
Down all the days.  
  
Can we heal the wounds of many wars?  
And the battle scars that went before  
Down all the days to 1992  
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992  
Somehow we lost communication  
But i'll find you girl and come back home to you  
Down all the days  
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992  
Somehow we lost communication  
I'll find you girl and come back home to you  
Down all the days.  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days
