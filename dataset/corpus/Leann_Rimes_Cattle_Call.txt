Leann:  
(yodeling)  
The cattle are prowlin',  
The coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the doggies roam  
Where spurs are a jinglin'  
And the cowboy is singing  
His lonesome cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He rides in the sun  
'til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
(yodeling)  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Eddy:  
For hours he would ride  
On the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up and slow  
His heart is a feather  
In all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He's browned as a fairy  
From ridin' the prairie  
And he sings with an western drawl  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Leann and eddy:  
(yodeling)
