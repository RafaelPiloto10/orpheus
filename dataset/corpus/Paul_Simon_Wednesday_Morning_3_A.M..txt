I can hear the soft breathing  
Of the girl that I love,  
As she lies here beside me  
Asleep with the night,  
And her hair, in a fine mist  
Floats on my pillow,  
Reflecting the glow  
Of the winter moonlight.  
She is soft, she is warm,  
But my heart remains heavy,  
And I watch as her breasts  
Gently rise, gently fall,  
For I know with the first light of dawn  
I'll be leaving,  
And tonight will be  
All I have left to recall.  
Oh, what have I done,  
Why have I done it,  
I've committed a crime,  
I've broken the law.  
For twenty-five dollars  
And pieces of silver,  
I held up and robbed  
A hard liquor store.  
My life seems unreal,  
My crime an illusion,  
A scene badly written  
In which I must play.  
Yet I know as I gaze  
At my young love beside me,  
The morning is just a few hours away.
