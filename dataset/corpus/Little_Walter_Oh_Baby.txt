Oh baby, you gonna miss me when I'm gone  
Oh baby, you gonna miss me when I'm gone  
I thought you were my baby  
And you would always be my friend  
Oh baby, I feel tears comin' in my eyes  
Baby, I feel tears comin' in my eyes  
If I don't leave now baby  
I'm goin' to break down and cry  
Oh baby, I'll never touch your love again  
Oh baby, I'll never touch your love again  
Well you said, you'd be my honey  
My sweetheart until the end  
You got my heart a achin' 'cause I love you so  
Things are pretty down, I can't stand no more  
Ooh ooh ooh, gonna miss me when I'm gone  
Oh baby, you gonna miss me when I'm gone  
Oh baby, you gonna miss me when I'm gone
