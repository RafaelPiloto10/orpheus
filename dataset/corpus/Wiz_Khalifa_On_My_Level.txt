Haha  
Say Jim,  
Uh, it's the champagne pourin'  
Big joint rollin'  
Bombay sippin'  
No blunt smoking  
Bad bitch gettin'  
Thick and she got some friends with her  
I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor  
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures  
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter  
nigga, you know everything tailored  
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper  
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through  
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to  
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool  
That's what I have to do  
  
[Chorus]  
See after drinking champagne all night  
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might  
Homie I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
So I'mma take one shot to the brain  
And I order three more shots  
I'm going in, aye  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
  
Spent a couple dollars on my engine  
motor roaring when I back out the garage  
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar  
Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car  
'Cause I be going hard, roll the camera  
Life just like a movie I'm the star  
Wish you was in my position  
You too broke to play the part  
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back  
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'  
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'  
Straight out the burg,' where we drink and we smash niggas  
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mayne  
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'  
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'  
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin' and we ain't sleepin'  
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'  
We just freakin'  
You rollin' with short dog baby  
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady  
Come to my house I give 'em everything they want  
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women  
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, G.H.B., Marijuana  
She can suck it if she wanna  
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends  
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I'm high as fuck  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
Man I'm sloppy drunk  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
I finna pass out  
man I swear I'm on my level  
A nigga get smashed out  
My6 nig' I swear I'm on my level  
  
Man I'm high as fuck  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
Man I'm sloppy drunk  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
I finna pass out  
man I swear I'm on my level  
A hater gettin' smashed out  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
  
[Chorus]
