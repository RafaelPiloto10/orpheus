Through-out my dream these hands are tied  
You wear your mask, but I see inside  
Never a vision I haven't seen  
All these lies spurred from dreams  
All these lies left me blind  
Whether yours? is all in time  
With these hands built this life  
Hands of mine now I'm alive  
Just can't hide from my self  
Just can't hide from my self  
I just can't hide from my self  
Just can't hide from my fuckin' self  
  
I can't hide  
I can't hide  
And I can't hide  
And I can't hide  
Cause I just can't be myself  
Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself  
And I just can't hide from myself  
Every time it's just myself  
  
I can't hide from my fuckin' self  
I wanna peel my skin hang it on the shelf  
Die from no pain  
A minimal brain  
Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane  
Too impulsive too impatient  
Anxiety's got me screamin' this hatred  
Still I strive to stay alive  
Gotta get mine cause I just can't be myself  
  
Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself  
And I just can't hide from myself  
Every time it's just myself  
  
Is there some future? contemplate  
I need gratification before it's too late  
The cravings are dry, drive me through  
Self destruction can always be true  
Islands of fire keep me alive  
No drugs around can fill me inside  
  
I can't hide  
And I can't hide  
I know I can't hide  
And I can't hide  
I just can't be myself  
And I just can't fuckin' be my self  
I just can't hide from myself  
Every time it's just my self
