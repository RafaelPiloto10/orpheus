Alright  
I know your wheels are turning, got your fire burning  
I know your heart's as cold as stone  
You're covered in abuses, dripping with excuses  
I know you got a lover at home  
  
But you'll come here to me, time after time  
You'll go down on your knees  
Yeah girl I can read your mind  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
  
Your going empty handed, smiling like a bandit  
Knocking on my window each night  
You're sweeter than a beauty queen, darker than a limousine  
Need me cause I feel right  
  
Yeah when it's sink or it's swim and the temperature flies  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
Because we're partners in crime, ooh yeah  
  
When it's sink or swim and the tale's that's you're blind  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
Ooh yeah, because we're partners in crime  
Because we're partners in crime  
Partners in crime, partners in crime  
Let's go, ha
