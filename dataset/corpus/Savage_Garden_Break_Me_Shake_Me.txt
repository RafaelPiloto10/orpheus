She says, " I can help you, but what  
Do you say?"  
Cause it's not free baby, you'll have  
To pay  
You just keep me contemplating, that  
Your soul is slowly fading  
  
God, don't you know that I live with a ton  
Of regret?  
Cause I used to move you in a way  
That you've never known  
But then I accused you in a way that  
You've never known  
But you've hurt me in a way that I've  
Never known  
  
Break me shake me hate me
