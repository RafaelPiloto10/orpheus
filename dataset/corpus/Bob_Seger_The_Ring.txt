By the light of the moon  
To a 50's tune  
He pledged his love to her  
A girl so rare  
A girl so fair  
The girl for him for sure  
He could see himself getting up every mornin'  
For the rest of his life  
Just to look in those eyes so blue  
It was all he ever wanted to do  
She was all he'd ever need to see him through  
  
They were still in their teens  
When he gave her the ring  
They were married late one May  
And they moved into a little house  
On the far end of town  
Out by the big highway  
And all through the days  
And all through the nights  
The cars and trucks rolled on by  
And he slept through it all just fine  
Every night he slept just fine  
  
Sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window  
Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon  
Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping  
Hoping the dawn would come soon  
  
She'd done well in school  
She'd followed the rules  
And she'd always stood out from the rest  
She'd go off to college  
And work her way through  
Then move to some city out west  
She had it all planned  
She'd have her career  
She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked  
  
She'd wake up one morning all packed  
And leave here and never look back  
  
Most of her friends thought it soon would be over  
Not many thought it would last  
Most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other  
And soon it would pass - soon it would pass  
  
Now twenty years have gone  
And her kids have moved on  
And she's still on the far end of town  
Her youngest - she's livin' somewhere in L. A.  
And her oldest - he works on a nearby farm  
Her husband comes home  
And they talk over supper  
He's usually the first to turn in  
Another day comes to an end  
Another day just ends  
  
And sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down  
She'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing  
And she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture  
But not at the ring - not at the ring  
She never looks at the ring
