The time has come  
Before our yesterday is here  
I said, the time has come now baby  
For you and me to get a few things clear  
  
I might be right or I might be wrong  
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong  
I might be rich I might be poor  
Please don't ya ever close that door  
  
Come home and talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
You better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time  
  
Well I gave you everything that I had  
Now you're sayin' you're a little bit mad at me  
I taught ya everything I knew  
There ain't too much more I can do for you  
You feel there's somethin' wrong?  
Then you'll have to tell me it's wrong  
  
You know it too  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
Don't hold it in  
Come on baby, I'm still your friend  
  
Why don't you talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
Now ya better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time  
  
I might be right or I might be wrong  
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong  
I might be rich I might be poor  
Please don't ya ever close that door  
  
Come home and talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
You better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time
