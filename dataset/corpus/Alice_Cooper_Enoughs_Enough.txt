Enough's enough's enough's enough  
This year's been really really rough  
Hey Dad...What'd you do with mother  
Hey Dad...Why'd you hide your brother  
I just want to tell you that I'm really felling bad  
I tell you  
  
Enough enough's enough's enough  
Enough enough's enough's enough  
I'm up to here with all your stuff  
  
Hey Dad...What'll happen now sir?  
Hey Dad...Can we live without her?  
I don't need your money, your position or your candy, Daddy  
Enough enough's enough's enough  
  
When my mother died, she laid in bed and cried:  
"I'm going to miss you, my brave little cowboy"  
I saw my father smile (a smile he tried to hide)  
He told me "Son, I've really got you now, boy"  
So come on, little cowboy  
  
Go buck and fuck and make a buck  
Gonna show me how, boy?  
I wish you lots and lots of luck  
Are you leavin' now, boy?  
  
Hey, Dad...try and keep this sacred  
Hey, Dad...how'd you hide the hatred  
I just want to tell you you're a lousy Dad to hell with you
