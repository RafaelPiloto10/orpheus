Shadows are fallin' and I'm runnin' out of breath  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
When you get up in the mornin' and you see that crazy sun  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
There's a train leavin' nightly called "When All is Said and Done"  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sometimes when you're doin' simple things around the house  
Maybe you'll think of me and smile  
You know I'm tied to you like the buttons on your blouse  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Hold me in your thoughts  
Take me to your dreams  
Touch me as I fall into view  
When the winter comes  
Keep the fires lit  
And I will be right next to you  
  
Engine driver's headed north up to Pleasant Stream  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
These wheels keep turnin' but they're runnin' out of steam  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Keep me in your heart for a while
