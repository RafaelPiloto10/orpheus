She was a red-hot hoocie coocher  
She was the roughest toughest rail  
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie  
She loved him though he was cokey  
He took her down to Chinatown  
And showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden  
He gave her things that she was needin'  
He gave her a home built of gold and steel  
A diamond car with platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses  
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses  
Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes  
She sat around and counted them all a million times
