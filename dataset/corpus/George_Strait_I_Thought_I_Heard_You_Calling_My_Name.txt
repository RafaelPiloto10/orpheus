I said goodbye to you this mornin'  
With only these words to explain  
I said I'd found someone I love better  
But I still hear your voice call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name  
Funny, I still feel this way.  
Your voice seem so close, but I knew  
That by now you were many miles away  
  
I walk through the streets of the city  
People passing by think it's so strange  
I'm talkin' but there's no one beside me  
I thought I heard you call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name  
Funny I still feel this way  
Your voice seems so close but I knew  
That by now you're many miles away  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name
