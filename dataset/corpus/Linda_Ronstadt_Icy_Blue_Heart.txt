She came on to him like a slow moving cold front  
His beer was warmer than the look in her eye  
She sat on a stool he said "what do you want"  
She said "give me a love that don't freeze up inside"  
  
He said I have melted some hearts in my time dear  
But to sit next to you, lord I shiver and shake  
And if I knew love, don't think I'd be here  
Asking myself if I have what it takes  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn what's been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
  
These days we all play cool calm and collected  
Why, our lips could turn blue shootin' the breeze  
But under the frost thought he detected  
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knees  
  
He said girl you've a beauty like I've never witnessed  
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air  
But I've felt the cold follow the first kiss  
And there's not enough heat in the fire burning there  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn what's been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn what's been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears
