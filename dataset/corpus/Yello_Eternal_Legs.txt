Across the space  
We fly around the world  
For years, years, years, years,  
  
We're out of control  
Inside an iron ball  
Desire  
  
[Chorus]  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again  
No choice  
  
An iron box  
Electric brain release  
Away, away, away, away  
  
A piece of steel  
That's all we ever feel  
No pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Desire  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again
