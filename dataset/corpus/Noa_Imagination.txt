Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
Imagination is lazy  
Your whole perspective gates hazy  
Has you askin a daisy what to do  
What to do  
  
Have you ever felt a gentle touch  
And then a kiss  
And then, and then  
Find it's not only your imagination  
Again  
Oh, well  
Imagination is silly  
I go around all willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that  
You'd want me too  
And yet I can't imagine that  
You'd want  
Me  
Too
