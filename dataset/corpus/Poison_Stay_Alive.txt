Listen up, child, there's one thing I've got to make clear  
Yeah, I do  
You don't see it coming  
hear it coming  
Acting like you know nothing  
About that strange rumor going on around here  
  
Take me back to the land of the living  
Take me down where the sun do shine  
Take me back, things be different  
You get it, got it, oh, you better get it now  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay alive, let your soul rise up from the bottom  
Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time  
Stay alive, It don't do you no good looking up from the bottom  
Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time  
  
You talk about lies and pain  
It don't do you no good with your face in the cocaine  
  
Love, hate, watch that mother  
She'll bring you down like no other I've seen  
If you know what I mean  
  
Take me back, got to face that demon  
Take me down, don't play its fool  
Take me back, things be different  
You get it, got it, ooooh, you better get it now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, I ain't seen nothin'  
No, I ain't seen nothin'  
No, I ain't seen nothin' like you before  
  
[Chorus]
