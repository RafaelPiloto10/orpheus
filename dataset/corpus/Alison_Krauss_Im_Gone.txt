When you came to me  
You said love could not erase  
The ever present memory of another face  
  
I tried to make you love me  
How I could I be so blind  
To think I'd be the one to change your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I'm gone before you start  
Well you can find me in your heart  
Who can say if its right wrong  
I've waited for you too long  
And if I can't hold on  
I'm Gone  
  
When you came to me  
I said love will find a way  
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay  
  
I guess you couldn't see  
As the shadow's in the night  
It seems the time for us just wasn't right  
  
[Chorus]
