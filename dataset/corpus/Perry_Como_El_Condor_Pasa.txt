I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail,  
Yes, I would,  
If I could,  
I surely would . . . hmm  
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail,  
Yes, I would,  
If I only could,  
I surely would . . . hmm  
Away, I'd rather sail away,  
Like a swan that's here and gone . . .  
A man gets tied up to the ground,  
He gives the world it's saddest sound,  
It's saddest sound . . . hmm  
  
I'd rather be a forest than a street,  
Yes, I would,  
If I could,  
I surely would . . . hmm  
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet,  
Yes, I would,  
If I only could,  
I surely would . . .  
Away, I'd rather sail away,  
Like a swan that's here and gone . . .  
A man gets tied up to the ground,  
He gives the world it's saddest sound,  
It's saddest sound . . .  
  
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet,  
Yes, I would,  
If I only could,  
I surely would . . .  
Yes I would . . .
