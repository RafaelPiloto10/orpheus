The cold reign of darkness-shadows the infinite shadow  
Enlisting blackness to repairthe wounds  
Which were successfully administered  
By the cruel curse of life's-blinding lights  
Hell regurgitates devouring magma from the dank depths  
  
Royalty or not-you're all gonna die  
Catholic or not-you're all gonna die  
  
Once more to reclaim the throne-ever more to claim heredity  
Ownership of the dead and all the responsibilities  
Falling helpless into the hands of no-more you  
That cold lonely planet was never your real home  
  
Rich man or not-you're all gonna die  
President or not-you're all gonna die  
  
There are those who defy the end-scream and beg for more  
Dragged away and destined to scream  
Whims that howl in tormented storms  
No rights to be-no rights to see  
Your sad epitaph shall now read as follows  
  
Scientist or not-you're all gonna die  
Satanist or not
