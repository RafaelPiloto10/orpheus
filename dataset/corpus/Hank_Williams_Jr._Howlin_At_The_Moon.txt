I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in  
I can't even spell my name my head's in such a spin  
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old table spoon  
You got me chasin' rabbits walkin' on my hands and howlin' on the moon  
Well Sug I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad  
And then I even want and lost what little sense I had  
Now I can't tell the day from night I'm crazy as a loon  
You got me chasin' rabbits pullin' out my hair and howlin' at the moon  
  
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree  
Cause there ain't a hounddog in this state that can hold a light to me  
I ate three bones for dinner today I tried to tree a coon  
You got me chasin' rabbits I'm cratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon  
  
I rode my horse to town today and a gaspump we did pass  
I pulled him up and I hollered whoa and I said fill him up with gas  
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham he changed my tune  
You got me chasin' rabbitts spittin' out teeth and howlin' at the moon  
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard  
But honey baby when I fell the whole world must have jarred  
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if I'd take me for your goom  
You got me chasin' rabbitts pickin' out rings and howlin' at the moon
