I can't wait to say all the things I want to say  
You don't help at all, thinking I am just a fool  
But one has changed and one remains, going on  
Even if it takes a thousand years or more  
Even if we cried a thousand tears, I'm sure  
We'd still want more and more  
Just the other day taking love you won't repay  
Where's the give and take? Tell me why the sudden heartache?  
The emptiness and loneliness say it all  
Even if it takes a thousand years or more  
Even if we cried a thousand tears, I'm sure  
We'd still want more and more  
Walked all over me, played around with my heart  
Who knows where or when from the middle through until the end?  
An easy touch, you knew as much all along  
Even if it takes a thousand years or more  
Even if we cried a thousand tears, I'm sure  
We'd still want more and more
