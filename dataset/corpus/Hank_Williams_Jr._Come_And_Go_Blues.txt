People say you're no good I couldn't cut to loose babe if I could  
Well I seen this thing down on the ground  
Baby I'm too far gone to start turnin' around  
Well if only you make up your mind  
Take me where you go or just leave me here to pine  
  
Lord you got those come and go blues woman you got those come and go blues  
Got me feeling like a fool just like a fool  
  
Round and round round to go  
Don't ask me why I stay here cause I do know  
Maybe I'm a fool to care baby without your sweet love I would be nowhere  
Here I'll stay lost in your will until that day I find someone else  
But I don't know just when that will be  
I don't know I can't say and I can't see  
  
Lord you got those come and go blues woman you got those come and go blues  
Got me feeling like a fool just like a fool
