Here she comes  
Here she comes  
Ribbons flying from her half-forgotten hair  
Look at her run  
See what the world and love have done  
See all her faces  
See all her faces  
  
Look in my eyes  
That she is me  
I can't disguise  
See all her faces  
Ah, ha, see all her faces  
  
I'm looking for someone  
Of the gentle kind  
Knowing that looks can lie  
Looking for someone  
Is he there to find?  
Or should I run on by, ah, ha  
  
Here she comes  
Here she comes  
Shadows sadly chasing  
Every step she takes  
Look at her now  
She needs love so much more somehow  
See all her faces  
See all her faces  
  
Look at my life  
The wasted years  
Each a knife  
See all her faces, ah-ha  
See all her faces  
  
Waiting for someone  
Who will set me free  
Passing the time too fast  
Waiting for someone  
Is that where he'll be?  
Or should I run right past? , hmm  
  
There she goes  
There she goes  
Somehow making me and all her faces sad, oh, oh  
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, da, ba, da
