I tried to kill the pain  
But only brought more  
(So much more)  
I lay dying  
And I'm pouring, crimson regret, and betrayal  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
Do you remember me?  
Lost for so long  
Will you be on the other side?  
Will you forget me?  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
(Return to me salvation)  
(I want to die!)  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
My wounds cry for the grave  
My soul cries, for deliverance  
Will I be denied?  
Christ! Tourniquet! My suicide
