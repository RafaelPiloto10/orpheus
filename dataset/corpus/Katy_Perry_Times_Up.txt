I've played the song,  
Now it drives me crazy  
I've run the race  
Now I'm too damn lazy  
This love of ours  
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah  
Now I must approach to life today,  
Seems a little different,  
Hard to say,  
But it looks like the end.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
We've surfed the wave  
Now we've hit the short end  
We've squeezed the fruit  
Till there's no more juice left.  
We're both so good  
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah  
Hey but no one's got to die  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
As I'm waving you goodbye  
I want you to smile  
Save a picture in your frame  
File it right next to my name  
I'm willing to die  
For love willing to try  
But not willing to lie for love  
I know that this cakes already baked  
Now it's burning burning.  
  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut,  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Times up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah  
Even when it's gone.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I get enough,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone
