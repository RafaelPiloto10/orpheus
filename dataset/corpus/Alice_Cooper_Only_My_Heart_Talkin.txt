Anybody's dream can fall apart  
Anybody's mask can break  
Couldn't tell you how I wanted you  
Enough to make you want to stay  
I never said the words out loud  
I guess I couldn't get 'em straight  
Baby, give me one more chance  
Before you walk away  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
I tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Oh baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
Everytime I take it to the edge  
Everytime I'm so afraid  
Don't you know I cry my eyes out, babe  
Everytime you look away  
Oh, I almost dropped a tear  
But I caught it just in time  
I'd say those things you want to hear  
If you'd help me, help me, help me try  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
Tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
Well, I don't want to hide away  
Hide away without you, baby  
Don't you go and run away  
Come and help me, baby  
Just a little help, baby  
Oh, my little baby  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
I tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah it's only only only only only, only only only  
My heart talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
It's my heart that does the talkin'  
talkin' to you  
ah... talkin' to you
