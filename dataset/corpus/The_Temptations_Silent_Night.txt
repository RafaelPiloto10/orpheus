'Twas the night before Christmas  
And all through the house  
Not a creature was stirring  
Not even a mouse  
  
In my mind, I want you to be free  
For all of our friends, to listen to me  
Now hear what I say  
We wish you a Merry Christmas  
To each one of you  
  
Silent night, holy night.  
All is calm and all is bright.  
Round yon virgin mother and child.  
Holy infant, so tender and mild.  
Sleep in heavenly peace.  
Sleep in heavenly, heavenly peace.  
  
Go on and rest your mind and sleep  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night.  
Shepherds quake at the sight.  
Glories stream from heaven afar.  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia.  
Christ the Savior is born, oh yes he is.  
Christ, Christ the Savior is born.  
  
What a joyous day  
  
Silent night, holy night.  
All is calm and all is bright.  
Round yon virgin mother and child.  
Holy infant, so tender and mild.  
Sleep in heavenly peace.  
Sleep, sleep in heavenly, heavenly peace.  
  
Just sleep and relax your mind  
To all our family and friends  
I want you to remember this line  
Merry Christmas to all of you  
Merry Christmas to all of you  
  
Merry Christmas from The Temptations
