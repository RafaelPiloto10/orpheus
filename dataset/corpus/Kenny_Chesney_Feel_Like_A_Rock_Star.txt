Do you smoke, do you drink do you yell out, "Hank"  
Do you fold it in your pocket do you lock it in the bank  
Jack it up, drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick it back chillin' or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now, it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you kick the dirt, or work a Vegas stop  
Do you hit the strip, or roll a country mile  
Do you wear 'em uptight, or do you keep it loose  
Do you leave it in the truck or sneak it in, in your boot  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick it back chillin'  
Or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Now, whether you're pimped up hangin' in the VIP  
Or way up high in the cheapest seats  
Hey, pretty mama, if you roll with me  
There'll be diamonds in the sky and the radio screen  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick back chillin' or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you smoke, do you drink do you yell out, "Hank"?  
Do you fold it in your pocket do ya lock it in the bank?  
  
Do you jack it up or drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Whatever makes you feel like a rock star)  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
