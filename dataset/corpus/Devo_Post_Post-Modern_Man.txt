If I had a hammer  
I'd wake up all my neighbors  
Pounding out a rhythm  
All about you  
If I had a pencil  
I'd push me some paper  
I'd build a skyscraper  
To get close to you  
If I had a lasso  
I'd said out the window  
And land on an island  
Next to you  
If I had a hot rod  
I'd fasten up my seat belt  
And break the speed limit  
Gettin' to you  
But I ain't got a hammer  
And I ain't got a pencil  
And I ain't got a lasso  
So I'm doing it the hard way  
Like a post post-modern man  
If I had a credit card  
I'd clear me a pathway  
Through the deepest jungle  
Right to your door  
If I had a camera  
I'd snap away my fingers  
And collect up the pictures  
Of you, of course  
But I ain't got a hot rod  
And I ain't got a credit card  
No chance for a camera  
So I'm doing it the hard way  
Like a post post-modern man  
Well I ain't go a hammer  
And I ain't got a lasso  
No chance for a camera  
So I'm doing it the hard way
