Was it something I did  
In another life?  
I try and try  
But nothing comes out right  
For me  
Bad Karma  
  
Killing me by degrees  
I took a wrong turn  
On the astral plane  
Now I keep on thinkin'  
My luck is gonna change  
Someday  
Bad Karma  
  
It's uphill all the way  
I can't run, Can't hide  
Can't get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma  
  
It's a dog's life  
And it's not my fault  
Ought to hang my picture  
In the All-Time Losers'  
Hall of Fame  
Bad Karma  
  
It's a low-down dirty shame  
I can't run, Can't hide  
Can't get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma
