By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising.  
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door.  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving  
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working.  
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call.  
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all.  
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping.  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low.  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her,  
Though time and time again I tried to tell her so.  
She just didn't know I would really go.
