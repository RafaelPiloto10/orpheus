Standing in our presence  
Lord, my heart and life are changed  
Just to love You and to live to  
See Your beauty and Your grace  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed  
And I'll forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord  
  
You've called me, I will follow  
Your will for me I'm sure  
Let Your heart beat feel my heart's cry  
Let me live to serve Your call  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed  
And I'll forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name  
Nations rise up and seek Your face  
And Your Kingdom is established  
As I live to know You more  
  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed  
And I'll forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord  
  
Now I will never be the same  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed  
And I'll forever sing Your praise  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord  
I live to know You, Lord
