I love your lovin' ways when you hold my hand  
And with a little squeeze you make me understand  
That I'm the only one underneath the sun for you, for you  
Well I love your lovin' ways, yes I love your lovin' ways  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I love your lovin' ways when you kiss a kiss  
The way you pop it up makes me go for this  
Because you makes me feel  
I'm the only one you need, yes you need  
Well I love your lovin' ways, I love your lovin' ways  
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed  
Oh yeah, your kisses  
That taste so good  
Oh they tell me  
Darling, you're not made of wood  
Well I love your lovin' ways when you hold me tight  
You're always good to me and you treat just me right  
So baby take my love  
'Cause it's meant for you, just you, just you  
Well I love your lovin' ways, oh I love your lovin' ways  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I love your lovin' ways when you hold me tight  
You're always good to me and you treat me right  
So baby take my love  
'Cause it's meant for you, just you, just you  
Well I love your lovin' ways, yes I love your lovin' ways  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I love your lovin' ways, I love your lovin' ways  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I love your lovin' ways, I love your lovin' ways  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
