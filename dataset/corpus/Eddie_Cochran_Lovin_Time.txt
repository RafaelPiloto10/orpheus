The breeze will tease the trees  
And whistle by the brook, we'll take a look  
And ripple by your ear, to clew you in  
It's lovin' time again  
For you and I will find a hideaway for love  
Will always have the right of way  
No need to tell us two, it's lovin' time again  
(Lovin' time again)  
  
Now if the girl for you can't see your point of view  
Lovin' time will leave a spell  
The first thing that you know, you'll have a heart in tow  
The rest is up to you  
The moon will be discreet  
It won't repaet the things you say to me  
It's time we meet, so let romance begin  
It's lovin' time again (lovin' time again)
