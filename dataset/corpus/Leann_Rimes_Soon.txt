Soon, Baby  
I will cry my last tear  
Soon, yea  
I will be over you  
Soon, Darlin'  
All these tears won't be here  
Soon yea  
  
You know that I will be over you Soon  
One night baby you won't be in my dreams  
One night yea  
I'll finally make it through one night darlin'  
I won't call out your name  
I won't be in this place  
Soon I will be over you  
  
Soon as the mountains turn into rivers  
Soon as the sea turns into sand  
Soon as the sun comes up at midnight  
That's how Soon  
  
Soon all the hurt will end  
Until then i'll just pretend  
Soon it will be over  
Soon Yea  
I keep telling myself I'll be over you  
Someday Soon  
  
Soon as the mountains turn into rivers  
Soon as the sea turns into sand  
Soon as the sun comes up at midnight  
That's how soon  
  
I will be over you Baby  
Soon yea  
I will be over you darlin'  
If only in my dreams  
I will be over you  
Someday Soon  
Someday Soon  
  
Soon oh yea  
Soon
