Sometimes we know, sometimes we don't  
Sometimes we give, sometimes we won't  
Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're wrong  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes it's bad when the going gets tough  
When we look in the mirror and we want to give up  
Sometimes we don't even think we'll try  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Well we're gonna have to sit down and think it through  
If we're only human what more can we do  
The only thing to do is eat humble pie  
Sometimes we cry  
  
'Fore they put me in a jacket, and they take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we can't see anything straight  
Sometimes everybody is on the make  
Sometimes it's lonely on the lost highway  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Gonna put me in a jacket, and take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry
