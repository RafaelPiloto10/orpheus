When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me  
Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree.  
Don't put your faith in love my boy, my father said to me,  
I'll fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree.  
  
Ref (2x):  
Lemon tree very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet,  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.  
  
Beneath the lemon tree one day my love and I did lie,  
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.  
We past that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree,  
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me.  
  
Ref (2x)  
  
One day she left without a word she took away the sun,  
And in the dark she'd left behind I knew what she had done.  
She left me for another it's a common tale, but true,  
A sadder tale, but wiser now I sing this song for you.  
  
Ref (3x)
