Fallin' asleep at the wheel again baby,  
You're driftin' over the line.  
You're hands are tied, but you're losin' grip quickly  
Fix me, can you read the sign!  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
Dreamin' of the other side!  
Save your tears and laughter because  
It doesn't matter what you find  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go.  
  
So, if you think you need it,  
Here's the place to feed it  
It ain't pretty.  
  
When, everything that you do is wrong,  
And you  
Feel like you can barely survive  
When those around you  
Are crumblin' downwards  
Buried in the sunset of life.  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
And screamin' like a bitch from hell,  
  
Save your dreams  
Up your patience  
Doesn't matter what you sell  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go!  
  
So, if you think you want it!  
Here's the place to get it,  
It ain't pretty  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
It ain't pretty  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
Dreamin' like you're out of control,  
Save your tears and laughter  
Because this is the ride  
And this is the show  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show!  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go  
  
So, if you think you want it  
Just come in and get it  
  
It ain't pretty
