Come, Thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy, never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me, ever to adore Thee  
May I still Thine goodness prove  
While the hope of endless glory  
Fills my heart with joy and love  
Oh, to Grace, how great a debtor  
Daily I'm constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above
