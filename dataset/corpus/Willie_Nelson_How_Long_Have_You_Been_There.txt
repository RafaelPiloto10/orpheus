I've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun can shine  
I've turned away from everyone and everything that wanted to be mine  
Somehow I always shot my eyes and heart to everything that I could share  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
  
And every path I've taken I have turned around and quickly closed the door  
It seems as though I knew if I ever stop to feel I want more  
I kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhere  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
  
How long have you been standing there protecting me from love that shouldn't
be  
Knowing all alone that I could realize that you were meant for me  
Now I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burned  
I've got to clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learn  
  
For I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to care  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
And now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there
