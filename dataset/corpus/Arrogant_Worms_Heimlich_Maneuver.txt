I love you so much I need the Heimlich Maneuver  
  
The sun goes down on another day  
A day where I haven't found love  
I try to eat, but all I taste  
Is the flavor of a broken heart  
Then I saw you across the room  
I gasp and my breathing stops  
My heart's in my throat, or is it a potato?  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
My love is consumating, while I'm asphyxiating  
Over her  
  
When I wake up, I'm on the floor  
Faint, dizzy and alone  
My stomach hurts, I think my ribs are cracked  
Not sure if I'm in a dream  
I turn my head, and there you are  
I call out and my breathing stops  
It's her again, crushing my esophagus  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation  
Mouth to mouth  
  
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek  
Helps me back on my stool  
She's a waitress here, but in the night  
She's a student at nursing school  
She comes again with a smile and the bill  
I pick it up and choke again  
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance  
For my bill  
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy  
And an airbag
