I'm alive  
'Cause Jesus gave me life  
He opened up my eyes  
I can see clearly now  
  
Oh, everybody dance now, oh  
  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Praise His name  
  
My desire  
Is to lift You higher  
It's only burning brighter  
This passion inside of me  
  
Oh, everybody dance now, oh  
  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Praise His name  
[x2]  
  
This praise is bursting out  
And I can't contain it now  
This praise is bursting out  
Out, out, 1, 2, let's go  
  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us  
Everybody, give it up for Jesus  
Praise His name  
[x2]
