How can I convince you to stay  
Even though I hurt you  
I didn't mean to how can I begin to say.  
Though all my words are fading,  
I'm begging you please don't go away  
  
I'm softly saying sorry now,  
Down on my knees, begging you please!  
It's the same old story somehow  
Trying the days, don't turn your heart away  
Sorry if I love you, begging just to hold you now.  
  
You touch my innermost sensitivity,  
If you right saying,  
The things I keep denying,  
It's hard to capture in love on the need to pay,  
I won't stop loving  
I'm begging you please don't go away,  
  
I'm softly saying sorry now  
Down on my knees, begging you please,  
It's the same old story somehow, trying the days,  
Don't turn your heart away.  
Sorry if I love you,  
Begging just to hold you now.  
  
Down on my knees, begging you please,  
It's the same old story somehow, counting the days,  
Don't turn your heart away  
Sorry cause I love you,  
I'm begging just to hold you now.
