They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be  
They say we'll fall  
Like others will fall  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You know you'll break my heart  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You'll see me fall apart  
Don't tell that it's over  
Or else I, well I might fall apart  
Now, when we first met  
I was just a poor boy on the street  
And you looked at me and took me in  
Yeah, and knocked me off my feet  
Now you don't really want to break things up  
The things we've been through, boy they're enough  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Don't say that it's over  
You know you'll break my heart  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You'll see me fall apart  
Don't tell that it's over  
Or else I, well I might fall apart  
They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be
