[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]  
When I say jump, you say how high  
I ain't never seen nobody, how they get so high  
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane  
This party got me insane, so jump jump jump jump  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Now I'm gon take it to the roof  
Everybody with me got they own parachute  
You ain't scared of heights when you sipping on Goose  
Party all night like I'm flying jet new?  
You ain't never seen nobody get this loose  
Shawty acting naughty with her body, what it do  
Jump to this man, bump to this man  
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man  
Got another hit man  
Hold up, I wanna go up, don't wanna throw up  
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us  
Dance, the boy got us all feeling high  
Ask, the shawty, I'm a astronaut  
High rollin baby like I'm jumping on fire  
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire  
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly  
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there  
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air  
Up up and away take it off like mere?  
NBA balling, I don't care  
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty and she make it bounce in the
room?  
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady, can I get on your hot air
balloon?  
Sky high, still clubbing like I'm part of the mile high  
Ears popping, Bubbalicious help me get right  
Keep popping in position after midnight  
Moese? fried chicken up in NY  
Jigga what, don't it feel good  
Houston? We gonna jump ship, all aboard  
Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed?  
Cali is jumping, hit the switch on the 6 4  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Come on and jump, jump, jump [Repeat: x3]  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All the fellas) jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
(All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies, let me see you)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down
