I ran all the way home  
Just to tell you that I'm sorry  
I really didn't mean to be  
So mean to you  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to beg you to forgive me  
I want your love to be my own  
Just mine alone
