Now the contracts out  
They've put the word about  
I'm coming after you  
  
It's not the money I make  
It's the thrill of the chase  
And I'm coming after you  
  
I watch your every move  
Study the things you do  
And the pattern of your ways  
  
I watch the way you walk  
I hear your telephone talk  
I want to understand the way you think  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Better watch out, cause I'm the assassin,  
Better watch out, better watch out  
  
I'm in a cold cold sweat  
I taste the smell of death  
I know the moment's getting closer  
  
And as you walk to the light  
I feel my hands go tight  
Excitement running through my veins  
  
I've got you in my sights  
I've got you dead to rights  
The triggers waiting for my finger  
  
I feel adrenalin rush  
It's just the final touch  
You can kiss your ass goodbye  
  
[Chorus]
