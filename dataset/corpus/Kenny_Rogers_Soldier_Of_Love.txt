I am only one of those who care  
Who care about the faith of love  
I know there's many others just like me  
I know they two ain't had enough  
Cos this heart's doin' battle on the front line  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
I am a soldier of love.  
  
I see it in your eyes you felt the heat  
There was a time when you believed  
Love is the only way to make it thro'  
Or be another casualty  
From that heart's doin' battle on the front line  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
I am a soldier of love.
