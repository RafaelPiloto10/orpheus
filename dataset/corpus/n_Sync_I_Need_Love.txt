I need love, you need love  
We all really need love  
All I want, all I need  
We all really need love  
  
I just want to tell you how I feel  
I just want to have a love that's real  
How can I stop this burning desire  
I can see that you're the one for me  
You're the only one I really need  
I need a love that burns like a fire  
  
I need love, you need love  
We all really need love  
All I want, all I need  
We all really need love  
I need love  
  
All I want to do is give it a chance  
Everybody needs a true romance  
I would give anything to be with you  
I will give you all the love you need  
If you only give your love to me  
What would I do if I were without you  
  
(I need love) I need love  
(You need love) You need love  
We all really need love  
(We all really need love)  
(All I want, all I need)  
(We all really need love)  
I need love [Repeat: x3]  
  
(I need love) I need love  
(You need love) You need love  
We all really need love  
(We all really need love)  
(All I want, all I need)  
(We all really need love)  
We all really need love  
I need love  
I need love
