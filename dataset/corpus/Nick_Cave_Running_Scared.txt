Just running scared, each place we go  
So afraid, that he might show  
  
Yeah, running scared, what would I do  
If he came back and wanted you?  
  
Just running scared, feeling low  
Running scared that you love him so  
  
Just running scared, afraid to lose  
If he came back, which one would you choose?  
  
And then all at once, he was standing there  
So sure of himself, his head in the air  
While my heart was breaking, which one would it be?  
Then you turned round and walked right out on me
