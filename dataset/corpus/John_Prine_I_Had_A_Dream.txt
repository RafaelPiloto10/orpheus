I had a dream last night  
Last night I had a dream  
Everything was black and white  
And it smelled like gasoline  
We stood in the corner  
And I held you tight  
I kissed your mouth  
Till my head got light  
Last night when I had a dream  
I had a dream last night  
Last night I had a dream  
Birds were flying left and right  
Through the light of a movie screen  
Everyone was looking  
For something to do  
I even thought  
I had a chance with you  
Last night when I had a dream
