All my life I've been searchin'  
All my life I've been uncertain  
I been abandoned and left alone  
At fifteen I had to leave home  
The black sheep, the bad seed  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think she's a little crazy  
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve  
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me it's all good  
She's happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
Two packs and a pint a day  
To hide the shame  
And wash away the pain  
Aww the pain  
Every road was a dead-end street  
Runnin' from the law  
And runnin' on empty  
You couldn't shake the marks that were left on me  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think she's a little crazy  
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve  
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me it's all good  
She's happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
[Repeat]  
Misunderstood  
Misunderstood
