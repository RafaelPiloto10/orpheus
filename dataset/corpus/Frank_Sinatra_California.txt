I've known her valleys, I've known her mountains  
Her missions and her courtyards and her fountains  
The giant redwoods towering in the skies of her  
That grow as though as they know they show the size of her  
  
I've often wandered her farthest reaches  
Her deserts and her snow and, yes, her beaches  
A land that paradise could well be jealous of  
That's California, California, blessed by heaven from above  
That's California, land I love
