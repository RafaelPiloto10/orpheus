I'm gonna change my ways of doing things around here  
I'm turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear  
'Cause I've got a woman who's better than most  
And I've made a mess of her plans  
  
So startin' today all I'm gonna be is her man  
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter  
Been an SOB right down to the letter  
I've had misadventures I even got pictures  
  
Of even more than I can stand  
So startin' today all I want a be is her man  
I'm gonna give it all back cause all I've done is take  
I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make  
  
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me  
A second chance again  
So starting today all I'm gonna be is her man  
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter...  
  
I'm a little bit late but I'm wise enough  
I'm taking her by the hand  
Startin' today all I want a be is her man
