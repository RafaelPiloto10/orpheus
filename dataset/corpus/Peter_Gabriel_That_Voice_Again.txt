I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I'm listening to the conversation:  
Judge and jury in my head  
It's coloring everything  
All we did and said  
And still I head that sharp tongue talking  
Talking tangled words  
I can sense the danger  
Just listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I'm hearing right and wrong so clearly  
There must be more than this  
It's only in uncertainty  
That we're naked and alive  
I hear it through the rattle of a streetcar  
Hear it through the things you said  
I can get so scared  
Listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
What I carry in my heart  
Brings us so close or so far apart  
Only love can make love  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again
