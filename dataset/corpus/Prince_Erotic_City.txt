I...I...I...I...  
Erotic City  
Erotic City  
  
All of my purple life  
I've been looking for a dame  
That would want to be my wife  
That was my intention, babe  
  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone  
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
Every time I comb my hair  
Thoughts of you get in my eyes  
You're a sinner, I don't care  
I just want your creamy thighs  
  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone  
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
All of my hang-ups are gone  
How I wish you felt the same  
We can funk until the dawn ('Til the dawn) (Until the dawn)  
How I wish you were my dame (Baby won't you call my name)  
  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone  
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
Baby, you're so creamy  
  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone ('Til the dawn)  
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time (You and me)  
Some time, some time, some time, Erotic City  
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive  
  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone (Come alive)  
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me  
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone  
Erotic City
