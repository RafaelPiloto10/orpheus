Donnie's got a secret and you know it  
He was yours, in the summertime, yeah  
About ten years ago  
He promised you to stay forever  
Live with you  
It's so bittersweet now  
When you know what you lost  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend: tender, sexy, sweet and  
Blond  
  
He's always on your mind  
The season changes  
Years went by  
But that chapter of love stays unfinished for you  
  
Keep on dancing through your new life  
Maybe, make a move  
Make him see you again,  
As the flower you are  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend, tender, sexy, sweet and  
Blond  
  
In the summer time, yeah  
In the summer time, life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
In the summer time, yeah  
In the summer time, life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side
