Cocaine flame in my bloodstream  
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane  
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early  
Morning rain  
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine  
My eyes been stung with dust and blind  
Held you in my arms one time  
Lost you just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Jolene  
I ain't about to go straight  
It's too late  
I found myself face down in a ditch  
Booze in my hair  
Blood in my lips  
A picture of you holding a picture of me  
In the pocket of my blue jeans  
Still don't know what love means  
Still don't know what love means  
Jolene  
  
Been so long since I seen your face  
Or felt a part of this human race  
I've been living out of this here suitcase for way too long  
A man needs something he can hold onto  
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you  
Either one of them things will do  
  
[Chorus]
