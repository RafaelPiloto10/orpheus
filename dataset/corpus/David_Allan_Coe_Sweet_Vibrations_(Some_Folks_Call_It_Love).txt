Ain't no sense in crying Lord I'd rather see you smile  
Come down from the city life and stay with me awhile  
There's so much that nature wants to share with you and me  
Put your hand in mine and let this old world set us free  
  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
  
Come out to the country find your peace of mind  
Leave that dirty city somewhere way behind  
We found something out here some folks search along  
Never been so happy never sang a happy song  
  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
  
(Oh Pete Drake)  
  
Bo came by to see us he's a friend of days gone by  
Danny played some guitar licks that made me want to cry  
Ol' friends from California called us on the telephone  
I got no time for misery Lord no time to be alone  
  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love
