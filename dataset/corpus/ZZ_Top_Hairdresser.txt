Blues-based tune a la John Lee Hooker  
  
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame  
The shape my hair is in  
It's way too humid, today, my head, it ain't no friend  
If I was seen out, I'd have me arrested  
Gimme, gimme, gimme my sweet hairdresser  
  
Hairdresser, hairdresser  
  
She's hip to the fastest bob,  
She give a good lather-job  
She don't stand no messin' around  
Gimme, gimme, gimme my hairdresser this town  
  
Hairdresser, hairdresser  
Conk it up, conk me baby  
  
I likes a wax, I likes a straight  
I don't like the kind of hair you love to hate  
I can dig it dread, I can dig it buzzed  
I can dig a 'do' that does the fuzz  
God, my hair it looks molested  
Gimme, gimme, gimme my sweet hairdresser  
  
Hairdresser, hairdresser  
Hairdresser, hairdresser  
Yo, yo, Milano
