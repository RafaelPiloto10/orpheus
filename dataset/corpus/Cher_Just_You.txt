With his big brown eyes he came my way  
I didn't know then what he had to say  
I could tell that he felt bad  
By the way he looked that he felt sad, oh yeah  
  
Sometimes you hurt me baby, I don't know why  
I'll always love you baby till the day I die  
But when you look at fellas  
Baby I get jealous  
I only live my life for you  
Anything you say I'll do  
I'll live for you, I'll die for you  
I'll even climb the mountains high for you  
  
Thought right then he'd break my heart  
I could feel the teardrops start  
Why didn't he know I love him so  
I could never let him go, oh no  
  
I'd never hurt you baby, tell you why  
I'm gonna love you till the day I die  
When I look at fellas  
Baby don't get jealous  
I only live my life for you, anything you say I'll do  
I'll live for you, I'll die for you  
I'll even climb the mountains high for you  
  
I love you, just you, nobody else but you  
I love you, only you,every day, every day, just you
