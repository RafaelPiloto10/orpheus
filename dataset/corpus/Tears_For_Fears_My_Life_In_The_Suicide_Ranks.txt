My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
I used to call it  
Are you still precious  
Love for your mother  
Wine on the carpet  
All in the breaks of dawn  
You'll find the widest while you came  
That let the dress...'  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
Love me like a child, no one tells me why.  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
Whoah, thank you for the help but  
Well, the high road is the low road!  
Tell me what do you think this is  
Who know better all of a talk  
...  
... or the crow  
Will you hold me, will you shake me  
Will you think you're all alone'  
Well you don't look for your health in the color of your skin'  
I open up let the darkness come in'  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my!, .. ooh!  
  
... the suffering!
