One day I'll get home before the sun hits the blinds  
And give you - I'll give you something to remember me by  
That's the way I am  
It's what I got in mind but I don't know if I can  
You gotta shoot your gun - don't expect me to dance  
Hold me up to the spotlight but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
These empty pockets are my deepest friends  
Full of nothing but good intentions  
That's the way it is  
It may not be much but I can blow you a kiss  
I've been wrong - I've been wrong once before  
I'll be all right tomorrow but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
  
I may be lazy or a living wreck  
I won't be swayed by your expectations  
That's the way it is  
It may not be much but you know what to kiss  
I've been wrong - I've been wrong once before  
I'll be all right tomorrow but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath
