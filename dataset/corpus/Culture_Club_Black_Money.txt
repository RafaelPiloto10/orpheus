Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
  
Fortunes find you.  
Cross out every emotion.  
Standing right behind  
A shadow of devotion.  
Somebody else's life  
Cannot be mine.  
  
But when you love someone  
And they don't love you in return.  
When you love someone,  
You've got money to burn.  
  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
  
I believe that  
Nothing could come between us.  
Magic potions,  
Won't you save them for dreamers?  
Somebody else's life cannot be mine.  
But when you love someone,  
And they don't love you in return.  
When you love someone,  
You've got money to burn.  
  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
  
Give me some love,  
But don't waste my time.  
Black money.  
I'll love you again,  
But you must be mine.  
Black money.  
Give me some love,  
But don't waste my time.  
Black money.  
Fortunes find you.  
Cross out every emotion.  
Standing right behind  
A shadow of devotion.  
Somebody else's life  
Cannot be mine.  
  
But when you love someone,  
And they don't love you in return.  
When you love someone,  
You've got money to burn.  
  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
Do you deal in black money?  
  
Give me some love,  
But don't waste my time.  
Black money.  
I'll love you again,  
But you must be mine.  
Black money.  
Give me some love,  
But don't waste my time.  
Black money.
