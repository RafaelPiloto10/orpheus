hmmmmmm  
  
Verse:  
The world seems so cold,  
when i face so much all alone.  
A little scared to move on  
and knowing how fast I have grown.  
And i wander just where i fit in  
oh the visions alive in my head  
  
chorus:  
i will be strong on my own  
i will see through the rain i will find my way  
i will keep on traveling this road  
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny  
  
verse 2:  
i can't lt go now,  
even when darkness surrounds.  
but if i hold on, yer, i will show the world  
all the things that you never expected to see from little old me,this
pittsburgh girl.  
and i wander just where my place is,  
close my eyes and i remind my self this. oh yer  
  
chorus:  
i will be strong on my own  
i will see through the rain i will find my way  
i will keep on traveling this road  
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny  
  
It comforts me, it keeps me  
alive each day of my life.  
Always guiding me, providing me  
with the hope i desperateley need.  
Well i gotta believe there's something out there meant for me.  
o i get on my knees, praying i will receive,  
the courage to grow and the faith to love.  
and...  
  
chorus:  
i will be strong on my own  
i will see through the rain, i will find my way  
i will keep on traveling this road  
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny  
  
yer yer
