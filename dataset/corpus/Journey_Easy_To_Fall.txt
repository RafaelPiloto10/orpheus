In the morning, sunlight shining  
The face in the mirror knows the crime  
Voices cry from the darkness  
A broken promise one more time  
  
You say you believe in love  
And still you run  
You only believe in God when you come undone  
  
So here you are  
You brought everything on yourself  
So easy to fall  
When you're all alone by yourself  
  
He said he's tried everything he could  
A fool's illusion one more lie  
There'll be demons waitin' in the shadows of a concrete world  
Tears are runnin' tonight  
  
You say you believe in love  
And still you run  
You only believe in God when you come undone  
  
So here you are  
You brought everything on yourself  
So easy to fall, (easy to fall)  
When you're all alone by yourself  
  
Words unspoken  
The words unspoken  
The words unspoken  
The words unspoken
