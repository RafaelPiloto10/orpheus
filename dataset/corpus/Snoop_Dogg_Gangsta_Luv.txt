Lost dog I give it to her right and she like it  
She on the hip like a psychic, izzy.  
One of the coolest of fool on the flo  
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?  
I bowled up a winna and put it up in the air  
Got that low dress on you comin' up outta dere, yeah

You say you bite, well I bite back  
And I'm all go, we can do it till tomorrow

Kissin' on ya chest and I'm diggin' out your stress  
I won't stop till your finished  
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it, dream  
  
Every time I come around

Cause I'm a dogg I'm a give her what she like  
She say ma name loud, I say her name low  
That's what I aim fo, that's how the game go  
Baby like the way I wake her up,  
Cause I'm a gangsta I grab her by the butt  
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep  
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep  
Everyday is the same thang, I creep in  
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in  
I gotta have it, the L B raisement  
We was taught to dig em down crazy  
Lights out, I'm so lit  
Mama's so gone, daddy won't quit  
I won't stop till yur finished  
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it  
Dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That  
Gangstaa  
G-Gangsta,  
Gangsta  
G-Gangsta,  
Gangsta  
G-Gangsta  
That gangsta love  
  
This the life that you show  
The loop, the coop, the grows  
Anything goes  
It's so good got her wiggling her toes (wow)  
The boss, The-Dream  
The floss, the cream  
The trips overseas  
All these things really don't mean a thing  
When I'm tearing that ass up workin' you like a shift  
I give it to you like a gift  
You hear what that boy say  
You wouldn't jack, give it up fast  
Then I hit it from the back  
Snoopy your so good, she screaming and I like that girl  
She off in another world  
I ain't stop till your finished  
She love this gangsta, especially when I'm in it . Dream  
  
[Chorus]
