Hello again the mornin' dawn has burned away  
The midnight mist  
Now and then I feel so fine  
And now and then I don't feel lonely  
Now and then and only in my mind  
  
I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay  
Now and then I talk with you  
And now and then you turn me on  
Now and then and when I don't feel blue  
  
Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you  
Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air  
Now and then you turn me on  
Now and then you must be gone  
Now and then I said  
Say so long, now and forever then
