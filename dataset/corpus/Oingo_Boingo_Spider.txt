Spider crawling, on the wall  
I see him and he, sees it all...  
And he sees it all  
I fell down in that lazy place,  
Where the English language can't - penetrate and I  
Saw your mouth moving - just forget it and lie here with me  
Maybe we should just, climb under the sheets  
Where the words they don't get in the way  
We were wondering, if you recall  
Is this the end of it - end of everything  
We were wondering, wonder  
Spider crawling - in my left ear  
Has a message I - want you to hear  
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for  
Do you miss me, miss me at all?  
Spider tells me, saw you yesterday  
With somebody new - what can I say?  
What can I...  
Spider crawling, I crawl with him -  
We go everywhere, we see everything  
We are falling, we are falling, falling to nowhere  
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for  
Do you miss me, miss me at all?  
Spider crawling, spider crawling, spider crawling...
