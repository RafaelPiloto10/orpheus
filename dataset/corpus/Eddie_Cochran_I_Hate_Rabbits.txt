(I'm a rabbit ooh-ooh) (I hates rabbits! )  
Got that rabbit on the run, chase that rabbit with my gun  
No long-ear rabbit laugh at me (I'm here, mail-special! )  
Got a great big rabbit-trap, long-ear rabbit don't know that  
The cotton-tale's gonna change his habbit (I hates rabbits! )  
Well now I been readin' in my magic book  
If I'm gonna have any luck with you  
I gotta have a rabbitsfoot  
The rabbit tries to change his looks  
He been readin' disguise books, but rabbit-rabbit  
(I hates rabbits! )  
  
The rabbit tried to set a trap  
But I'm too smart to fall for that  
I doubled back and really fooled him  
(Hey-hey, what's happening Mack?)  
The rabbit ran up a hollow log  
Stopped to talk to an old bullfrog  
Showed that cotton-tale how to can him (I hates rabbits! )  
Well now I been readin' in my magic book  
If I'm to have any luck with you, I gotta have a rabbitsfoot  
The rabbit's swimmin' in the river  
I'll just wait 'cause I'm no swimmer  
To catch a rabbit's lots of plannin'  
(Oh boy) (Man, what a champion) (I hates rabbits! )
