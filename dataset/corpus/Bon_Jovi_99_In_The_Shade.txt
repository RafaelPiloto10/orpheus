I feel I'm burning up with fever  
The fire's feeling really good tonight  
But it's all right  
'Cause I'm gonna see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally  
Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down  
Tonight, If Gina says it's all right  
  
I'm gonna see those senoritas lying under the sun  
Yeah they're greasing it up with their stereos on  
You know I want to be their blanket, gonna tell every girl  
Hey baby you're the one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whoa, tell the boys I'm on my way  
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet  
I got a party in my pocket,  
And you know I just got paid  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade.  
  
When the sun goes down, that's when the street heats up  
Senorita, margarita, fills your empty cup tonight  
She makes me feel so right  
A good time here doesn't cost much money  
Just a little sweet talking, let the pretties in the party  
And you're set for life  
Or one hell of a night  
  
I can see those sons of beaches  
Out there livin' it up  
In the surf and the sand,  
Man, that life ain't so tough  
So get me in the action  
Let me tell every girl she's the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade  
(I can almost taste it! )  
  
99, 99, 99  
99 in the shade  
99, 99,  
99 in the, whoa!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got the radio cranked in my old man's Chevrolet
