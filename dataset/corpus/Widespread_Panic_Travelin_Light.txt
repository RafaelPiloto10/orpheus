Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
Travelin' Light, just you and I  
Way on down to ecstasy  
Way on down and our own way  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
  
Travelin' Light, and you can catch the wind  
Travelin' Light, better let your mind pretend  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once, now maybe twice  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once, now maybe twice  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly
