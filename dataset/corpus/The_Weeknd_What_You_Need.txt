I just wanna take you there  
He don't got to go away  
Does he touch you here like this?  
Let me take the friction from your lips  
  
And I'ma love you girl  
The way you need  
Ain't no one goin' stop us  
Ain't no one goin' stop us  
And I'ma give you girl, what you fiend  
I'm the drug in your veins  
Just fight through the pain  
  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need what you need  
  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need what you need  
  
I got, everything what you want with me  
I do, everything he does times three  
And he don't gotta know, I got you on the floor  
Doing things you never thought you'd do  
Baby leave them high heel shoes  
'Cause I love it when you're lookin' down at me  
I'm lookin' up at you  
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock them boots off  
  
And I'ma love you girl  
The way you need  
Ain't no one goin' stop us  
Ain't no one goin' stop us  
And I'ma give you girl, what you fiend  
I'm the drug in your veins  
Just fight through the pain  
  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need what you need  
  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
He's what you want  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need  
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need what you need
