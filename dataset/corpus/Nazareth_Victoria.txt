Victoria, Victoria I could love you for a hundred years  
And still want more of ya!  
  
It's been a long time now since high school days  
But when I'm with you, darling you still amaze me  
No one could ever come before ya  
God knows how much I still adore ya  
  
My Victoria, Victoria, I could love you for a hundred years  
And still want more of ya!  
  
Hey little girl when we first met  
I was shaking so hard you really made me sweat  
You opened up my eyes and showed me  
You took me by surprise and floored me  
  
We walked to school together  
Just a boy and a girl  
We talked through all kinds of weather  
About giving our love a whirl  
  
Do you remember at the high school dance  
When the beach boys sang about good vibrations  
  
My Victoria, Victoria, I could love you for a hundred years  
And still want more of ya!  
  
We walked to school together  
Just a boy and a girl  
We talked through all kinds of weather  
About giving our love a whirl  
  
We were cruisin' the strip every Friday night  
  
My Victoria, Victoria, I could love you for a hundred years  
And still want more of ya!  
  
My Victoria, Victoria, I could love you for a hundred years  
And still want more of ya!  
Headin' for the beach in a two tone torc flight  
First time I turned and saw you  
God only knows I love you  
Never anyone before you  
Don't you know I still adore you  
  
My Victoria, Victoria
