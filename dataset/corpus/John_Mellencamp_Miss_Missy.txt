There's a band playing down the street we could see, yeah  
Movie showing down at the Von Lee  
A church supper with Grandma and Grandad  
Let's go out and have ourselves the best time we've ever had  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say goodnight, my Miss Missy  
Goodnight, it's time to go home  
Hey, I might call you later  
Oh Missy, girl, it's late, it's time to go home  
  
Weight of the world's now on your head  
I take back all those mean things I said  
Little baby kicking down in your gut  
I hope it doesn't grow up to be as crazy as us  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So let's dance slow just one more time  
Let me hold your face close to mine, yeah  
Let's pretend that Jesus has come  
To take us out just one more night for fun  
  
[Chorus:]
