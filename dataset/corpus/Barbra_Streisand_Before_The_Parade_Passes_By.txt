Dolly  
Before the parade passes by  
Before it goes on, and only I'm left  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta get in step while there's still time left  
I'm ready to move out in front  
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left  
With the rest of them  
With the best of them  
I wanna hold my head up high  
I need got a goal again  
I need got a drive again  
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again  
Before the parade passes by...  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta go and taste Saturday's high life  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta get some life back into my life  
I'm ready to move out in front  
I've had enough of just passing by life  
With the rest of them  
With the best of them  
I can hold my head up high  
For I've got a goal again  
I've got a drive again  
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again  
Before the parade passes by  
[Interlude]  
  
[All:]  
When the parade passes by  
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing  
When the parade passes by  
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing  
All of those lights over there  
Seem to be telling me where I'm going  
  
[Dolly:]  
When the whistles blow  
And the cymbals crash  
And the sparklers light the sky  
I'm gonna raise the roof  
I'm gonna carry on  
Give me an old trombone  
Give me an old baton  
Before the parade passes by!
