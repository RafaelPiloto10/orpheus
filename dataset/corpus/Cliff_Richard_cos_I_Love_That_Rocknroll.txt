Where has all that Rock'n'roll gone  
Oh won't somebody tell me where?  
Cause it used to be when I was young  
That you could hear them playing it everywhere  
But now it seems they're all so hooked on fashion  
The music's taken second place  
Everyone it seems has one obsession  
To beat the others in the race  
And it just don't feel right to me  
No no it just don't feel right to me  
  
Cause I love that Rock'n'roll too much  
And I don't wanna see it ever waving goodbye  
Yeah I love that Rock'n'roll too too much  
And I couldn't bear to see it go by  
Rock'n'roll you're too much to deny  
  
Oh where has all that music gone  
There must be some mistake  
From something that was so much fun  
They were burning bridges in their wake  
O. K. Everything has got to keep changing  
I know it has to be that way  
But isn't it too high a price we're paying  
We're losing most of yesterday  
And it just don't feel right to me
