It's all become a fantasy  
She sits and reads about Tiffany's  
I moan all day about the state of the world  
And the sun beats down  
  
Her book if full of pastel shades  
Filigree Femmes in lusts of jade  
While all around the bullets flew  
And the sun beats down  
  
Oh heavy heart, as deep as the endless sea  
A thought for every fish, why don't you let them be  
Your book's so frivol, but I'm tired of mine  
Show me some  
  
Make me laugh and make me sing  
Dancing girls  
Make me laugh and make me sing  
Dancing girls  
  
So many years but nothing's changed  
We curse the fire but we still feed it's flames  
My cards repeating the same sad song  
Why don't you put them down?  
Tonight is young, as young as she needs to be  
There's room for love, as much as there needs to be  
Show me a drink, show me a smile  
Show me some  
  
Make me laugh and make me sing  
Dancing girls  
Make me laugh and make me sing  
Dancing girls
