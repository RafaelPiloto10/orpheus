Oh yeah  
Progress flies, into our lives  
Got to find time, find time  
Talk digit talk  
You're doin' find  
Machines never mind  
They never mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Out on the border  
Of a changing skyline  
We put hope in front of fear  
And all the Heroes  
Have gone east of Eden  
We all need new frontiers  
  
Oh It's a 3D rise  
All technical jive  
Talk a video dive  
War is for fools  
Crisis is cool  
Barbarians play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
New, new, frontiers  
  
[Chorus x3]
