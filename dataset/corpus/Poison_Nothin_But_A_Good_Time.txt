Now Listen  
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent  
I can barely make it through the week  
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl  
But right now I can't make ends meet  
  
I'm always workin' slavin' every day  
Gotta get a break from that same old same old  
I need a chance just to get away  
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't need nothin' but a good time  
How can I resist  
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time  
And it don't get better than this  
  
They say I spend my money on women and wine  
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night  
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in  
I just like my fun every now and then  
  
I'm always workin' slavin' every day  
Gotta get a break from that same old same old  
I need a chance just to get away  
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You see I raise a toast to all of us  
Who are breakin' our backs every day  
If wantin' the good life is such a crime  
Lord, then put me away  
Here's to ya  
  
[Chorus: x3]
