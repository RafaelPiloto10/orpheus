Concentrate, you're on the middle  
Of this one way ride  
In the center lays the key  
To get back off to a while  
If you can't solve this riddle  
I'm afraid you'll have to stay  
In the ???  
Of underestimated betrayal  
  
See them point in your direction  
See the indifference in their eyes  
Just living in oblivion  
Struggling with too many wires  
So you've got to solve this riddle  
Other wise you won't get back  
So if I were you  
I would concentrate on the morbid one way track
