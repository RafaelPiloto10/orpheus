So sad, so sad  
So sad, so sad  
I didn't want to love you  
And you do want nothing at all  
So sad, so sad  
So sad, so sad  
  
There's a cold break in my dream  
Keeps turning round everything you've said  
It's so naked in my brain  
Makes it hard to be by myself  
  
Repeat opening verse  
  
And I didn't want to love you  
And I'm feeling the pain  
Stop watching the best things we loved in our life  
Was the wind and the sails  
And I needed to try for you  
That's lost on the night  
And it's found in the beautiful store in your eyes  
And it's making you cry  
So sad, it's so sad  
  
So sad, so sad  
So sad, so sad  
I didn't want to love you  
And you do nothing at all  
It's so sad, so sad  
So sad, so sad (x2)
