Summertime is finally here  
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear  
Out on forty nine  
Man I can see the lights  
  
School's out and the nights roll in  
Man, just like a long lost friend  
You ain't seen in a while  
And can't help but smile  
  
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime  
  
Temperature says ninety three  
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee  
But that swimmin' hole  
It's nice and cold  
  
Bikini bottoms underneath  
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat  
When them girls shimmy off  
Them old cutoffs  
  
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Don't matter how old you are  
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Yeah baby when you got  
  
Two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime
