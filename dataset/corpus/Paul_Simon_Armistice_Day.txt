On Armistice Day  
The Philharmonic will play  
But the songs that we sing  
Will be sad  
Shufflin' brown tunes  
Hanging around  
  
No long drawn blown out excuses  
Were made  
When I needed a friend she was there  
Just like an easy chair  
  
Armistice Day  
Armistice Day  
That's all I really wanted to say  
  
Oh I'm weary from waiting  
In Washington D.C,  
I'm coming to see my Congressman  
But he's avoiding me  
Weary from waiting down in Washington D.C.  
  
Oh Congresswoman  
Won't you tell that Congressman  
I've waited such a long time  
I've about waited all I can  
Oh Congresswoman  
Won't you tell that Congressman
