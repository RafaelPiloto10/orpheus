I keep on dancin' on the roof  
Try not to fall, stay in the groove  
A step too far. I'm out of place  
Life beats you up some of these days  
Just like a whisper there's a voice  
Inside of me  
It's sayin' you ain't got a choice  
Well, can't you see  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
  
I keep on walkin' in the clouds  
Find out what life is all about  
I keep on runnin' away from here  
To learn the grass ain't greener there  
Just like a whisper there's a voice  
Inside of me  
It's sayin' you ain't got no choice  
As you can see  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
Ooh, cause no one else but you  
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
Ooh, cause no one else but you  
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Yeah  
  
Keep rockin' in the street  
Keep landing on my feet  
Keep runnin' on and on  
Still play my favorite blond  
Keep rockin' mother earth  
Just all around the world  
These days mean safer sex  
Get my survival pack  
My orgasm isn't faked  
Ooh Lord, I need a break  
And what's annoying, too  
Is that damn thing in my shoe  
Ooh, there is a stone in my shoe
