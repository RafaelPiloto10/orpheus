No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again.  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Why can't you see what's going on?  
I know you'd never admit  
You would ever be to blame  
Everything's a game to you  
The old days are gone  
And they're better left alone  
I cannot help you, it's much too late  
  
No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again.  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
There's always a reason why it happened  
You never never did anything wrong, but it  
It just happened to fall apart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Now that it's dark, all of your fears,  
Like shadows creeping around.  
You're much too scared to look down  
And it's lonely out on your own  
  
The old days are gone  
And they're better left alone  
But I still miss you  
I keep it to myself  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard
