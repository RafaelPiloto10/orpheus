Please, I just got to talk to you  
Please, well keep your head out of the loo  
Please, we're a long, long way from home  
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sick as a dog, what's your story  
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue  
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry  
Sick as a dog, 'cause you're really ain't that young  
  
Please, you were much to my surprise  
Please, you're a lady in disguise  
Please, you're the only friend I got  
Please, you're the last to see me rot  
  
Please, it's a shame you're so refined  
Please, she was the last thing on my mind  
Please, don't be late to take it light  
Please, you're gonna bay into the night  
  
Say goodnight
