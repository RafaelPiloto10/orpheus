There's a flame in the back of my mind  
And it's burning for you all the time  
'Cause I just want to touch you  
Do you want to touch me too?  
  
Now I know that you've heard this before  
But with me it could mean something more  
And I just want to touch you  
Do you want to touch me too?  
  
Everybody says we're too young  
But I know all the things that they just can't see  
I just want to get inside you  
If you'll give just a minute to me (ooooh).  
  
So I've said everything that I can  
And I'm hoping that you'll understand  
That I just want to touch you  
And you want to touch me too.
