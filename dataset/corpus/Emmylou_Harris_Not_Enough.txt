Oh my darling, I miss you so.  
How I loved you, you'll never know.  
Though it's time for me to let you go.  
Oh my darling, I'll miss you so.  
  
Can't believe you're really gone for good.  
I still hold on to places you once stood.  
I should move on, but I never could,  
Really believe you're gone for good.  
  
Oh my friend, what could I do?  
I just came home to bury you.  
The road is long, the road is rough.  
Your in my heart, that's not close enough.  
  
All those years, disappear  
All my tears, are not enough, not enough.  
How can it be the ties that bind,  
Cut down deep and are so unkind?  
When we lose them we will never find,  
Anything stronger than the ties that bind.  
  
I still have your memory.  
One or two pictures of you and me.  
Life is long and life is tough,  
But when you love someone,  
Life is not long enough.
