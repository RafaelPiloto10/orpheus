Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Though i know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,  
Vanished from my hand,  
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.  
My weariness amazes me, i'm branded on my feet,  
I have no one to meet  
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,  
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,  
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels  
To be wanderin'.  
I'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade  
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,  
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,  
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,  
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.  
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,  
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,  
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,  
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.
