Plus she's making pesos she got a crib on Peace street right on 17th street  
And I call her T.T.  
Wait a minute hold on dog do she got a kid?

Man I can't believe this chick? Damn? mm  
Tell me whats wrong dog, what the hell you damning about  
I'm your homie so just say whats on your mind  
Man I didn't know that you were talking about her  
So man your telling me you know her  
Do I know her like a pastor know his word  
  
[Chorus]  
We messing with the same girl same girl  
How could the love of my life, and my potential wife be the  
Same girl same girl  
Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the  
Same girl same girl  
Thought she someone that I can trust  
But she's been doubling up with us  
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl  
  
See I met her at this party in Atlanta  
Well I met her at this party in Chicago  
She came right up to me given me conversation  
I said do you got a man she said no, with no hesitation  
Well it must be a music thing cause she said the same to me  
At a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks  
  
She whispered in my ear and said can you take me home  
Me too  
Man she was in the chi singin' that same song  
Is that true  
And I thought it was true confession when she said  
I love you  
Man I thought her body was calling when she said  
I want you  
Look I even got some pictures on my phone  
Look at there, there she is with some boy shorts on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said she got me on her ring tone  
Are you talking about the pink phone  
Mm the blue one  
Man she told me that was turned off  
Its obvious that shes been playing us playing us  
Or constantly she's been lyin' to us lyin' to us  
Don't like the way that she's been goin' 'bout it goin' 'bout it  
Kellz what do you think we should do about it do about it  
Call her up at her home, she won?t know that I'm on the phone  
Yeah man that's a way  
Homie we about to bust this trick  
Man just ask her to meet up with you and I'm gonna show up too  
And then she won't know what to do  
We'll be standing there singing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See she was taken flights going back and forth  
I would pick her up at the Airport  
Man I really can't believe the  
Same girl same girl  
Hey, the same girl same girl
