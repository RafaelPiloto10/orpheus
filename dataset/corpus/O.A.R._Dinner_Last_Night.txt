It's ok  
If you lock yourself up at the end of the day  
And it's alright  
If you're gonna let us fade  
To nothing  
You worked harder for nothing at all  
Are you alright?  
She asked me deep after dinner last night  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back, you gotta be strong  
  
Are you ok?  
You've been staring far in the days  
Are you alright?  
Have I given you enough?  
Pick your pleasure  
But be sure that it's what you want  
Are you alright?  
She asked me deep after dinner last night  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back, you gotta be strong  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back, you gotta be strong  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man
