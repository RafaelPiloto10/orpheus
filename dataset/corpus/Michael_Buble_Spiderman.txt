Spiderman, Spiderman  
  
Does whatever a spider  
Spins a web any size  
Catches theives just like flys  
  
Look out!  
Here comes a spiderman  
  
Is he strong?  
Listen good  
Hes got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread  
Take a look overhead  
Hear that?  
There goes a spiderman  
  
In the chill of night  
At scene of the crime  
Like a streak of light,  
He arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, spiderman  
Friendly neighborhood spiderman  
Fame and fortune is ingored  
Action is his reward  
  
Look out  
There goes a spiderman  
  
In the chill of night  
At scene of the crime  
Like a streak of light,  
He arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, spiderman  
Friendly neighborhood spiderman  
Wealth and fame is ingored  
Action is his reward  
  
To him... Life is a great big??  
Where ever there's a crime  
Youll find the spiderman!
