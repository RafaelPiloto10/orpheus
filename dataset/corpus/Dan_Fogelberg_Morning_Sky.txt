You and I were lovers all along  
We had a good thing going strong  
And never doubted.  
Lately, I feel changes comin' on  
I know that I will soon be gone  
And you don't even want  
To talk about it.  
  
Oh, and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If there's something on your mind  
You better say it while there's time  
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that  
Morning sky.  
  
Oh, how did we ever come to this?  
There's nothing for me in your kisses anymore.  
Late nights in the kitchen  
I'm pretending I still care  
But we both know there's nothing there  
And you just keep on starin'  
At the door.  
  
Oh, and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If there's something on your mind  
You better say it while there's time  
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that  
Morning sky.

See that morning sky.
