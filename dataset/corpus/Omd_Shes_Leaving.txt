Everyday  
A new start  
A cheap affair  
A sordid truth  
We'll never learn  
To guide our hearts  
We'll never find  
What we deserve  
  
She's leaving  
She waited for so long  
  
She'd pretend  
Thant she cared  
Invent some tale  
Just to gain his heart  
But no more dreams  
She didn't dare  
She washed her hands  
Of this whole affair  
  
She's leaving  
She waited for so long  
  
But as she left  
She gave her heart  
Abandoned hope  
And turned for home  
I thought I'd ask  
But then again  
The more we learn  
The less we know
