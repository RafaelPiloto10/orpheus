Tell Mama  
Etta James  
  
Your dogs ain't found a good girl,  
One that love you and give you warning  
Now you find that you been misused,  
Well how many girls can think all right  
  
She'd embarrass you anywhere,  
She'd make her friends think that she didn't care  
Give me the chance and I'd been begging  
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to  
  
Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need  
Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right  
Let me hear you say
