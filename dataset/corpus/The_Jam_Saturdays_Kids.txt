Saturdays boys live life with insults,  
Drink lots of beer and wait for half time results,  
Afternoon tea in the light-a-bite, chat up the girls, they  
Dig it!  
Saturdays girls work in tescos and woolworths,  
Wear cheap perfume cause its all they can afford,  
Go to discos they drink baby cham talk to jan, in bingo  
Accents.  
Saturdays kids play one arm bandits,  
They never win but that's not the point is it,  
Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat,  
How about that, far out!  
  
Their mums and dads smoke capstan non filters,  
Wallpaper lives cause they all die of cancer,  
What goes on, what goes wrong.  
  
Save up their money for a holiday,  
To selsey bill or bracklesham bay,  
Think about the future, when they'll settle down,  
Marry the girl next door, with one on the way.  
  
These are the real creatures that time has forgot,  
Not given a thought, its the system,  
Hate the system, what's the system?  
  
Saturdays kids live in council houses,  
Wear v-necked shirts and baggy trousers,  
Drive cortinas fur trimmed dash boards,  
Stains on the seats - in the back of course!
