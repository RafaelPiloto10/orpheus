You are all the same  
Go the way you came  
Different names  
But very little else has changed  
  
Difficult to find  
Easy to resign  
Didn't seem to matter  
When I didn't mind  
  
Out before it's in  
Everybody wins  
Give them what they want  
And they are giving in nothing in return  
  
Will we ever learn?  
It's jumbled  
And it's getting harder to discern  
I run my mind circles the vertigo  
  
I've had enough  
It feels as though nothing's going to change
