Here's the house. Here's the city and the stream. Here's the father to my
dream. Here's the lost and lonely look in your eyes. When you leave I will
break down and cry.  
  
Sleeping single - I will wait for you. I'm sleeping single - 'til you change
your mind. Sleeping single - I will wait for you 'til time has gone by.  
  
I'll pay the price for all the love you poured like rain "toujours l'amour"
over again, but the midnight chills are getting so rough and the bed is big
enough for both of us.  
  
Sleeping single - I would die for you. I'm sleeping single - won't you change
your way. Sleeping single - I will pray for you to stay, he-he-hey...he-he-
hey...
