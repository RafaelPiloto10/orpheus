Am i sorry your sky went black,  
Put your knives in babies backs?  
Am i sorry you killed the kennedy's and huxley too?  
  
  
But i'm sorry shakespeare  
Was your scapegoat  
And your apples sticking into my throat  
Sorry your sunday smiles are rusty nails  
And your crucifixion commercials failed  
But i'm just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
Am i sorry to be alive  
Putting my face in the beehive?  
Am i sorry for booth and oswald, pinks and cocaine too?  
  
  
I'm sorry you never check  
The bag in my head for a bomb  
And my halo was a needle hole  
I'm sorry i saw a priest being beaten  
And i made a wish  
But i'm just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
"the valley of death we are free  
Your father's your prison you see"  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
You're just a copy of an imitation
