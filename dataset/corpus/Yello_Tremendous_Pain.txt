Oh baby, show me the way  
To hell and heaven  
Oh baby, how do you spell  
Suite 907  
  
And I say,  
8, 6, 5, 4  
Oh baby, I can't take it no more  
  
Play your melody, your tune is divine  
Play your song, your beat is mine  
Tremendous pain,  
  
Love, heaven, submission and more  
Love, hell, in Suite 904  
  
Stormy weather, heavy rain  
No moon in the city  
Shining streets, Friday night  
No mercy, no pity  
  
I hide in my church, in Suite 909  
Your word is my bible, your beat is divine  
Suite 909  
  
Love, heaven, submission and more  
Love, hell, in Suite 904  
  
You bless me with an easy touch  
Your fantasy, I need it so much  
I hide in my church, I float on the Nile  
Your word is my bible, your beat is divine  
  
8, 6, 5, 4  
Oh baby, give me some more,  
Tremendous pain  
  
Love, heaven, submission and more  
Love, hell, in Suite 904  
  
Tremendous pain
