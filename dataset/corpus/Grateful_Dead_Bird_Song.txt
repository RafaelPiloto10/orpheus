All I know is something like a bird within her sang,  
All I know she sang a little while and then flew on,  
Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.  
  
If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?  
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by,  
Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night.  
  
Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore.  
Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind.  
  
All I know is something like a bird within her sang,  
All I know she sang a little while and then flew off,  
Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.
