Now who, who, who do you think I am?  
Well, I built this ark with Japheth, Shem, and Ham.  
Now what, what, what do you think it's gonna do  
When I live by faith and now my work is through?  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)  
I said it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)  
Yes, It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)  
I'm so happy to say (It's gonna rain)  
Oh It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain) on the world today  
  
Now when, when, when I am in doubt  
And I think that things for me will never work out,  
But where, where, where the heart is true,  
Ya know Lord, your God, will never forsake you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now who, who, who do you think I am?  
Well, I built this ark with Japheth, Shem, and Ham.  
Now what, what, what do you think it's gonna do  
When I live by faith and now my work is through?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forty days and forty nights (It's gonna rain)  
Forty days and forty nights (It's gonna rain)  
Hallelujah, it's alright (It's gonna rain)  
Everybody's sleepin' tight (It's gonna rain)  
Oh, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's gonna rain tonight.  
  
[Chorus x 3]
