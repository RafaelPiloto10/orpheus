There are colors on the street...red, white, and blue  
People shufflin' their feet, people sleepin' in their shoes  
There's a warnin' sign in the road ahead  
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead  
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them  
So I try to forgive 'em, any way I can, yeah...  
I see a girl in the night with a baby in her hands  
Under an old street light, oh, near a garbage can  
Now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit  
She hates her life, and what she's done with it  
That's one more kid, that'll never go to school  
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool  
Keep on rockin' in the free world (3x)  
( The US of A, the United States )  
( Ain't a free place, it's not a free place )  
( Ain't got the right to choose, barely got the right to vote )  
( There they got the right to make an honest buck )  
( The USA ain't a free, free place )  
There's a thousand points of light for the colored man  
There's a kinder, gentler police man's hand  
There's department stores, and toilet paper  
Styrofoam garbage for the Ozone layer  
There's a man of the people, said 'keep hope alive'  
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive  
Keep on rockin' in the free world (4x)
