Peoples, peoples, peoples  
You know what it means to be left alone  
Peoples, peoples, people  
You know what it means to be left alone  
Yeah  
Lord it happened to day  
Lord not even a call on my telephone  
Understandin'  
Lord a little love in the world is all I need  
A little love and understanding baby  
It's all in the world I need  
Lose of love  
A misunderstanding of a no good woman  
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed  
All right  
  
Every mornin'  
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me  
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me  
The birds sang the love song  
My baby's caused my heart to bleed
