I was alone thinking I was just fine,  
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine  
I thought that love was just a fabrication,  
A train that wouldn't stop at my station  
Home, alone, that was my consignment,  
Solitary, confinement  
So when we met, I was getting around you,  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you.  
  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
  
'Cuz there you stood, and I would,  
Oh I wonder, could I say how I felt and not be misunderstood?  
A thousand stars came into my system,  
I never knew how much I have missed them.  
Slap, on the lap, of my heart you landed,  
I was coy, but you made me candid,  
And now the planets circle around you,  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you.  
  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
  
So we build from here with love the foundation  
In the world of tears, one conselation  
Now you're here and there's a full brass band  
Playing in me like a wonderland  
But if you left I would be two foot small  
And every tear would be a waterfall  
Soundless, boundless, I surround you  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you.  
  
I just didn't know.  
  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
I didn't know I was looking for love  
  
(repeat to the end)
