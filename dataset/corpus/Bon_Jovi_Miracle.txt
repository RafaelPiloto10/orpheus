A penny for your thoughts now baby  
Looks like the weight of the world's  
On your shoulders now  
  
I know you think you're going crazy  
Just when it seems everything's  
Gonna work itself out  
They drive you right back down  
  
And you said it ain't fair  
That a man walks  
When a bird can fly  
We have to kick the ground  
The stars kiss the sky  
They say that spirits live  
A man has to die  
They promised us truth  
Now they're giving us lies  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause it's all on the line  
And I won't let you down  
(No I won't let you down)  
The river of your hope is flooding  
And I know the dam is busted  
If you need me I'll come running  
I won't let you down, no, no  
  
You're looking for salvation  
You thought that it'd be shining  
Like an angel's light  
Well, the angels left this nation  
And salvation caught the last train  
Out tonight  
He lost one hell of a fight  
  
He said  
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be  
I never can be everything you wanted from me  
I've got plans so big  
That any blind man could see  
I'm standing in the river  
Now I'm drowning in the sea  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's on the line  
And your heartbeat is slowing down  
Your feet are grounded still  
You're reaching for the sky  
You can let 'em clip your wings  
'Cause I believe that you can fly  
  
Well my eyes have seen the horror  
Of the coming of the flood  
I've driven deep the thorny crown  
Into the soul of someone's son  
Still I'll look you in the eye  
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought  
And I'll die without regret  
For the wars I have fought  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save you this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's doing time  
And your conscience is calling you out  
It ain't all for nothing  
Life ain't written in the sand  
I know the tide is coming  
But it's time we made a stand  
With a miracle
