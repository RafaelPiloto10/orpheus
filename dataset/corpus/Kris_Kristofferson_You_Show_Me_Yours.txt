If you're feeling salty, then I'm your tequila  
If you've got the freedom I've got the time  
There ain't nothing sweeter than naked emotions  
So you show me yours, hon, and i'll show you mine  
  
No ma'm I know this ain't all that you've ever been used to  
You with your rings on your fingers and time on your hands  
Sometimes it's nice to have somebody nice to be close to  
God knows I've been there before you and I understand  
  
Chorus.  
  
I wish that I was the answer to all of your questions  
God knows I know you wish you were the answer to mine  
Darling if you ain't a thing but a change in direction  
Lord don't you know you'd be somethin' I'm lucky to find  
  
Chorus.  
  
So you show me yours and i'll show you mine.
