Something wonderful is happening here  
It's indescribable but don't let it disappear  
Take this moment now before it's lost  
Give yourself away, don't come to cost  
  
We got love  
That's all that's really here now  
We got love  
And all we need is now  
  
Come and go with me let's enjoy de vew  
Make this day complete forget your solitude  
This time has come for us so take my hand  
It's written on your face I know you understand  
  
We got love  
That's all I feel here now  
We got love  
That's why we still here now  
  
All the way all the world  
It's the universe so wave  
It stays you and I  
And the way we feel today  
  
We got love  
That's all that's really here now  
We got love  
And all we need is now  
  
We got love  
I see it in your eyes  
We got love  
And it's a beautiful sign
