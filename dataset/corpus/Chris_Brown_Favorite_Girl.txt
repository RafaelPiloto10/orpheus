Up down, up down won't you give me a plenty girl  
Are you? Are you? You're my favorite girl  
Are you? You're my favorite girl  
Are you? You're my favorite girl.  
Thinking of all 'playing a movie  
  
Thinking of all, money are but a stand  
So so so girl that I just play  
So so so  
Intoxicating tonight imagination baby  
Intoxicating tonight, infatuation baby  
Or you're just like  
You're just like the cherry on top, if you bring the cake  
I promise I'll flow your hand 'cause..  
You know that I love it when you talk like that  
Give me that back.
