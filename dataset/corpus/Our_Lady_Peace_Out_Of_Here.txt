You don't understand and  
You don't try and see  
The white is too dull  
We need the reds and the greens  
You're big time now  
On new york tv  
A prime time fool  
For everyone to see  
  
Can't see a heaven  
Is the sky isn't clear  
You can't change a mind  
If it doesn't want to here  
  
Will we ever get out of here  
Lets stop and think awhile  
Another time another place  
Where everyone smiles  
  
You have the rights  
Or you seem to think  
Stopped dead in their tracks  
Other peoples dreams  
  
All those ideas  
Questioned by doubt  
I'm telling you man  
You'd better get out  
  
Can't stop the dance  
If the song isn't done  
You can't stop the change  
Outnumbered 100 to 1  
  
You don't understand  
You don't try and see  
You're in the cage and  
We've got the key  
  
Can't see the future 'til  
Its in front of you  
But you can't escape it
