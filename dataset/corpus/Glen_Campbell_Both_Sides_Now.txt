Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air  
Feathered canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way  
Now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone  
  
So many things I could have done, but clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow  
It's cloud's illusion I recall, I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels. The dizzy dancing way you feel  
When every fairytale comes real. I've looked at love that way  
Now that's just another show we've been laughing when you go  
  
If you care don't let them know don't give yourself away  
I've looked at love from both sides now from give and take and still somehow  
It's love's illusion I recall I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud say I love you right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I'd look at life that way  
Now old friends are acting strange. They shake their heads they say I've
changed  
  
But something's lost and something's gained in living every day  
I've looked at life from both sides now from win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusion I recall. I really don't know life at all
