You always won every time you placed a bet  
You're still damn good  
No one's gotten to you yet  
Every time they were sure they had you caught  
You were quicker than they thought  
You'd just turn your back and walk  
  
You always said  
The cards would never do you wrong  
The trick you said  
Was never play the game too long  
A gambler's share  
The only risk that you would take  
The only loss you could forsake  
The only bluff you couldn't fake  
  
And you're still the same  
I caught up with you yesterday  
Moving game to game  
No one standing in your way  
Turning on the charm  
Long enough to get you by  
You're still the same  
You still aim high  
  
There you stood  
Everybody watched you play  
I just turned and walked away  
I had nothing left to say  
'Cause you're still the same  
You're still the same  
Moving game to game  
Some things never change  
You're still the same
