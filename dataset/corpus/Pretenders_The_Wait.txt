Said the wait child magic child work it on out now work it  
The wait child pinball child pool hall child hurts  
The wait child pacing child forth back now hurts  
The wait child neon light late night lights hurt  
  
Oh gonna hurt some child child  
Gonna hurt some whoa my baby  
  
Said the wait child bruised ball child pride slapped child hurts  
The wait child crest felled child tear eyed child hurts  
The wait child bus stop child late come child hurts  
The wait child platform walk idle talk hurts  
Oh gonna hurt some child child  
Gonna hurt some whoa my baby  
  
I said child, child staring into the streetlight  
Messed up child lonely boy tonight  
Kick the wall turn the street and back again  
Oh boy you've been forgotten  
(repeat)  
  
I said the wait child pacing child forth and back now hurts  
The wait child bus stop child late come child hurts  
The wait child pool hall child pin table now hurts  
The wait child magic child work it on out now work it  
Oh gonna hurt some, child, child, child, child, child  
Gonna hurt some whoa my baby
