Oh I've come to the point where I've had one too many  
And one short of having too few  
Oh my bottle of freedom is one drink from empty  
And I'm back down to hung up on you  
I come here to escape and some say too often  
But not as much as I would like to  
Cause as high as I get is how low I'll be fallin'  
Oh back down to hung up on you  
Feeling nothing at all for awhile sure feels better  
Than the hurtin' you're puttin' me through  
But as sure as I am of the sunrise tomorrow  
I'll be back down to hung up on you  
[ steel ]  
Feeling nothing at all...  
Yes as sure as I am of the sunrise tomorrow  
I'll be back down to hung up on you
