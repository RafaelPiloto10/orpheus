(uh uh aaah) Let me put my arms around your head  
(dom do aaah) Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed  
Don't forget to turn on the light  
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright  
(dom do aaah) Pour me out another phone  
(dom do aaah) I'll ring and see if your friends are home  
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome  
Can lend us a book we can read up alone  
  
And try to get it on like once before  
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored  
Like the video films we saw  
  
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)  
And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)  
And turn her face away  
  
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)  
But she knows she really loves him  
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)  
It's a drive-in Saturday  
  
Jung the foreman prayed at work (dom do aaah)  
Neither hands nor limbs would burst  
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation  
  
(bah dom bah) cursing at the astronette  
(dom do aaah) who stands in steel by his cabinet  
He's crashing out with Sylvian  
The bureau supply for aging men  
With snorting head he gazes to the shore  
Once had raised a sea that raged no more  
Like the video films we saw  
  
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)  
And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)  
And turn her face away  
  
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)  
But she knows she really loves him  
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)  
It's a drive-in Saturday  
  
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)  
And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)  
And turn her face away  
  
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)  
But she knows she really loves him  
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)  
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah, yeah  
  
(drive-in saturday)  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
Drive in Saturday  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
It's a, it's a, it's a drive in Saturday  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir,  
Yes sir  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
Dom do do do, dom do do do  
(it's a drive-in saturday)  
Dom do do da, dom do do da  
? ? ?
