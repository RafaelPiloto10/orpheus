The sun disappears bringing fears that come only at night  
With hopes and dreams that will wither away in the light  
And thoughts wander back to the girl with the perfect smile  
Who said she would never leave you alone  
But she had to spend some time on her own for a while  
There's more than one nightmare at large in this city tonight  
You know you can't shut out the dark with the neon light  
Deep in the town the night birds are walking  
And somewhere a heart is being broken  
One lonely soul finds a bar that stays open all night  
It's alright until the night when you can't forget she went away  
It's alright until the night when you can't forget she went away  
A song drifts along from a bar where a jukebox plays  
And triggers the memory of happier summer days  
Drive to the beach, sun on the water  
Love was in reach and you never saw that  
The sun was sinking and love was fading away
