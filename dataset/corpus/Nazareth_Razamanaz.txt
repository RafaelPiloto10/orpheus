We've got to get it together  
You bring the wine, we'll bring the weather  
We haven't come to be clever  
Let's make it now cause this could be never  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight

Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance  
  
Now that we've come to a showdown  
We won't allow you a second to slow down  
The moment has come to deliver  
You as the taker, and we as the giver  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance  
All of the world loves a raver  
We're playin for ravers who savor the flavor  
You all appear calm and collected  
Razamanazin' you never expected  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight

Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet

Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet
