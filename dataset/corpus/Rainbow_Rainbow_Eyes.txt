She's been gone since yesterday  
Oh I didn't care  
Never cared for yesterdays  
Fancies in the air  
  
No sighs or mysteries  
She lay golden in the sun  
No broken harmonies  
But I've lost my way  
She had rainbow eyes  
Rainbow eyes  
Rainbow eyes  
  
Love should be a simple blend  
A whispering on the shore  
No clever words you can't defend  
They lead to never more  
  
No sighs or mysteries  
She lay golden in the sun  
No broken harmonies  
But I've lost my way  
She had rainbow eyes  
Rainbow eyes  
Rainbow eyes  
  
Summer nights are colder now  
They've taken down the fair  
All the lights have died somehow  
Or were they ever there  
  
No sighs or mysteries  
She lay golden in the sun  
No broken harmonies  
But I've lost my way  
She had rainbow eyes  
  
Oh, oh
