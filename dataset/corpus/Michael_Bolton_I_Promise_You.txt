I will promise you, yes I promise to  
Love you for all your life  
Love you every day and night  
I will always be there for you  
I'll be in your arms, you'll be in my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll love you forever, I promise you  
We'll be together, our whole life through  
There's nothin' that I, I wouldn't do  
With all of my heart, I promise you  
  
I will take your hand, and I'll understand  
Share all your hopes and dreams  
Show you what love can mean  
Whenever life just gets too much for you  
I'll be on your side, to dry the tears you cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I will always be in your arms  
And you will always be the flame  
within my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do  
I promise you
