She came from New York  
Seems like a bright spark  
Knew all the answers to the game  
Moved to a new town  
Soon pushed her way around  
But you're a lady just the same  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy  
  
Moved with the wrong pack  
Hard headed, well stacked  
Drop her guard if you drop her name  
Made all the wrong moves  
Knew all the lines to use  
Too many got burned in her flame  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then he broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy  
  
Since the news got around  
Someone I brought up town  
Needed a friend but no one came  
She tried to change her views  
But still she wasn't bad news  
Don't ever lose at your own game  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then he broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy.
