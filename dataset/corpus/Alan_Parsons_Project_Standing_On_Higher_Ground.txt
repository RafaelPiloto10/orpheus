I know the truth  
But I can't say  
And I have to turn my head  
And look the other way  
  
I'm not afraid  
And I won't lie  
As long as I see no wrong  
I won't need to testify  
  
I see the world  
And I'm looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While they're running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I feel the blow  
But I don't speak  
And I have to close my eyes  
Pretending I'm asleep  
  
Well I see the tears  
But I don't cry  
As long as I do no wrong  
I don't need an alibi  
  
I see the world  
And I'm looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While they're running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground
