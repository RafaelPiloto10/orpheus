Some people might say my life is in a rut,  
But I'm quite happy with what I got  
People might say that I should strive for more,  
But I'm so happy I can't see the point.  
Somethings happening here today  
A show of strength with your boy's brigade and,  
I'm so happy and you're so kind  
You want more money - of course I don't mind  
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes  
And the public gets what the public wants  
But I want nothing this society's got.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going underground, (going underground)  
Well the brass bands play and feet start to pound  
Going underground, (going underground)  
Well let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow  
  
Some people might get some pleasure out of hate  
Me, I've enough already on my plate  
People might need some tension to relax  
[Me?] I'm too busy dodging between the flak  
What you see is what you get  
You've made your bed, you better lie in it  
You choose your leaders and place your trust  
As their lies wash you down and their promises rust  
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns  
And the public wants what the public gets  
But I don't get what this society wants  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We talk and talk until my head explodes  
I turn on the news and my body froze  
The braying sheep on my TV screen  
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!  
Going underground, I'm going underground!
