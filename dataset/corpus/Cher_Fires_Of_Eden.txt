It's not over til it's over  
I heard someone say  
Must be a whisper in the wind  
'Cause you're too far away  
  
But in my restless sleep  
I could swear I saw you next to me  
Saying , oh I'm coming home  
You'll never spend another night alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Remember when love was innocent  
There was never a better time  
But you know those fires of Eden  
Still burn in this heart of mine  
  
The morning's uncertain  
It's a nervous day  
And I look for a reason  
Why I should feel this way  
  
I hear a voice run before  
Drifting through my open door  
Saying it's alright  
We're going to light those flames tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And don't you wonder  
How we drifted so far  
When we belong to each other  
We were miles apart  
  
And there's a place  
That was meant for the two of us  
And when you touch the embers  
You feel my love  
As strong as it ever was  
  
[Chorus]
