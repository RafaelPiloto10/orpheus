When she walked on down the street  
She was like a child staring at her feet  
But when she passed the bar  
And she heard the music play  
She had to go in and sing  
It had to be that way  
She had to go in and sing  
It had to be that way  
  
And I said no, no, no  
Oh, Lady Day  
And I said no, no, no  
Oh, Lady Day  
  
After the applause had died down  
And the people drifted away  
She climbed down the bar  
And went out the door  
To the hotel  
That she called home  
It had greenish walls  
A bathroom in the hall  
  
And I said no, no, no  
Oh, Lady Day  
And I said no, no, no  
Oh, Lady Day
