Guess mine is not the first heart broken,  
My eyes are not the first to cry,  
I'm not the first to know there's  
Just no getting over you  
I'm Hopelessly Devoted To You  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm out of my head  
Hopelessly Devoted To You  
Hopelessly Devoted To You  
  
I know I'm just a fool who's willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
But baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my heart aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
  
My head is saying fool forget him  
My heart is saying don't let him go  
Hold on to the end that's what I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you
