Sometimes I think of all the places where I don't want to go  
Then I think of all the things I don't want to do  
And when I think of all the people I don't want to meet  
I close my eyes and go to sleep  
  
Tully, baby, you're trapped behind your golden bars  
I'm the prince of poverty hangin' out in bars  
Your life's a Mercedes, a mansion with a pool  
My life's on a bus stop just waiting for some fuel  
  
Your obviousness disgusts me I see through your macho lies  
I'll fight everything you stand for  
There's something in your purse baby, my head is getting sore  
Maybe what we had was just green corn
