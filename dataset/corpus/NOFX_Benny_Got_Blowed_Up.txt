Tired of shootin' smack, tired of on the run  
Traded the needle for the gun  
Tired of livin' small, tired of the withdrawal  
No more retreat time for attack  
  
Oh Benny how many times you tried to kill yourself?  
OD's and robberies and super stunts  
I never thought you'd die from them  
  
Riding around in tanks, fire a round of blanks  
Benny had never had such fun  
Until he took a wrong step into bomb  
And that's when Benny got blowed up  
  
Alone, under a blanket soaked with sweat and piss  
We figured Benny would end up like this  
We just didn't think for them
