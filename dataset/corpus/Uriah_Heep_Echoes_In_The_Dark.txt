I have heard the echoes in the dark  
Dim and distant voices of the past  
And I've seen so far into the night  
And lingered in the land of no light  
  
Far beyond the  
Shrouded hours of dawn  
Through the mist  
Of daybreak I was borne  
But the day was  
Clouded still by night  
Leaving me in the land of no light  
  
Though I'd love to  
Say hello to you  
You might have to wait awhile  
To say goodbye  
For it must end as it began  
And then start again  
  
The day of darkness  
Comes to every man  
And lingers while he  
Reaches out his hand  
And he cannot know how it will end  
Till he finds out if he has a friend  
A friend
