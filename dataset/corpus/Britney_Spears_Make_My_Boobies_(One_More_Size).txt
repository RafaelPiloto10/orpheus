Oh boobies boobies  
Oh boobies boobies  
  
Oh boobies boobies  
My chest was supposed to grow  
My cleavage wasn't right, no  
My boobies boobies  
My breasts got complete with foam  
And now my sweater's tight, yeah  
  
Surgery I want to be a D  
Bigger memories  
I want them to show now  
No because  
  
My chest flatness was killing me  
And I  
I must confess I paid for these  
Paid for these  
I look thiry-two  
I'm just a child  
I am a crime  
Make my boobies one more size  
  
Oh baby baby  
I got double d's  
It's true  
Now you all been blinded  
Oh pretty boobies  
Your so big and oh, so new  
That? S just the way I planned it  
  
Golly rolling stones was naughty...  
See me baby barely wearing clothes now  
Oh because  
  
My chest flatness was killing me  
And I  
I must confess I paid for these  
Paid for these  
I look thirty-two  
I'm just a child  
I am a crime  
Make my boobies one more size
