You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You caught me with my guard down  
You floored me in the first round  
You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You hit me on the blind side  
You took me for a big ride  
But I won't let it get to me  
I couldn't go through all that  
No, I won't let it get to me  
I'll try and hold it all back  
And get even with you  
I'll get even with you  
Yeah, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You kick a man when he's down  
You kick him when he's on the ground, yeah, yeah  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You got me in a tailspin  
You really tried to do me in  
But I won't let it get to me  
I couldn't go through all that  
No, I won't let it get to me  
I'll try and hold it all back  
But I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you  
Hey, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you, wait 'n' see  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you
