We've been around forever  
Look at us now together  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to men friends  
Smiling across a friend's friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
We'll stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love, and getting  
Nothing that's worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware  
But once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare (oh)
