There's a man who's been out sailing  
In a decade full of dreams  
And he takes her to a schooner  
And he treats her like a queen  
Bearing beads from California  
With their amber stones and green  
He has called her from the harbor  
He has kissed her with his freedom  
He has heard her off to starboard  
In the breaking and the breathing  
Of the water weeds  
While she was busy being free  
  
There's a man who's climbed a mountain  
And he's calling out her name  
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles  
He calls again  
He can think her there beside him  
He can miss her just the same  
He has missed her in the forest  
While he showed her all the flowers  
And the branches sang the chorus  
As he climbed the scaley towers  
Of a forest tree  
While she was somewhere being free  
  
There's a man who's sent a letter  
And he's waiting for reply  
He has asked her of her travels  
Since the day they said goodbye  
He writes "Wish you were beside me  
We can make it if we try"  
He has seen her at the office  
With her name on all his papers  
Through the sharing of the profits  
He will find it hard to shake her  
From his memory  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a lady in the city  
And she thinks she loves them all  
There's the one who's thinking of her  
There's the one who sometimes calls  
There's the one who writes her letters  
With his facts and figures scrawl  
She has brought them to her senses  
They have laughed inside her laughter  
Now she rallies her defenses  
For she fears that one will ask her  
For eternity  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a man who sends her medals  
He is bleeding from the war  
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store  
There's a drummer and a dreamer  
And you know there may be more  
She will love them when she sees them  
They will lose her if they follow  
And she only means to please them  
And her heart is full and hollow  
Like a cactus tree  
While she's so busy being free
