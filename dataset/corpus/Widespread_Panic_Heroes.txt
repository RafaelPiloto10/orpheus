Johnny let his baby brother sleep  
Through the back door and baseball  
All the kids are waiting outside  
Old days come and go too soon  
Old friends, heroes, lifetimes  
Don't let a single memory fade away  
  
These are the days for heroes  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Everybody turns hero this time  
  
Feels good to watch a big man dance  
There's a wide smile (wild smell?) on the hot street  
Supper's over and the streets come alive  
The band plays our favorite songs  
Policeman, buy some ice cream  
Sounds different when you hear 'Mister Freeze'  
  
Even the streets carry heroes  
Look at every soul shake its life  
These are the days of heroes, tonight!  
  
Laughter come on downtown window and see faces walking back  
Tonight, everybody gonna remember, remember in time  
  
Brings peace to watch a baby smile  
And the years come  
Bring us new ones  
All that music waiting inside  
  
No, everybody turns hero  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Everybody turns hero tonight!  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Look at all the friend shaking life (?)  
Everybody turns hero
