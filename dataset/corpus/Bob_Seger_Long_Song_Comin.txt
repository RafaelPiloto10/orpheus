Politician 'bout to make his speech  
Signal for attention, please  
Then he shuffled his notes  
And wiped his sweating brow  
I looked at my friend next to me  
And we don't dare agree  
Before this is over  
We'll wish we woulda left right now  
'Cause it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it looks like he might throw in a little dancin', too  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy  
We got better things to listen to  
Lady from a church bizarre  
Was smiling from her head to her feet  
All the way down to her feet  
That she couldn't see  
She started speeking her piece  
I said "Stop, Wait a minute, please  
Before you start talkin'  
I wish you'd please listen to me."  
'Cause it sounds like a long song comin'  
And though some of the things you say might be true  
It still sounds like a long song comin'  
And baby, listen lady, I got better things to listen to  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it looks like you might throw in a little dancin', too  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy, I got better things to listen to  
Say, so it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it sounds like some just might be true  
Still it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy, I got better things to listen to  
And buddy, listen buddy, we got better things to listen to
