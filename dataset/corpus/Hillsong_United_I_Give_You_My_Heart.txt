Album: God is in the House  
Title: I Give You My Heart  
Words and music by reuben morgan  
  
This is my desire  
To honour You  
Lord, with all my heart  
I worship You  
All I have within me  
I give You praise  
All that I adore  
Is in You  
  
Lord, I give You my heart  
I give You my song  
I live for you alone  
Every breath that I take  
Every moment I'm awake  
Lord, have Your ways in me
