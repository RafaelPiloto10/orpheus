I read all the letters, I read each word that you've sent to me  
And though it's past now, and the words start to fade  
All the memories I have start, still remain  
  
I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no-one knows  
Oh sure my friends all come round, but I'm in a crowd on my own  
It's 'cause you're gone now, but your heart, still remains  
And it'll be here if you come again  
  
You see, I'd heard the rumors, I knew before you let me know  
But I didn't believe it, not you,  
No you would not let me go  
Seems I was wrong, but I love, I love you the same  
And that's the one thing that you can't take away but just remember.  
  
If leaving me is easy,  
Going back is harder.
