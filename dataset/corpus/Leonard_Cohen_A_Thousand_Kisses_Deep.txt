The ponies run, the girls are young,  
The odds are there to beat.  
You win a while, and then it's done  
Your little winning streak.  
And summoned now to deal  
With your invincible defeat,  
You live your life as if it's real,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
You lose your grip, and then you slip  
Into the Masterpiece.  
And maybe I had miles to drive,  
And promises to keep:  
You ditch it all to stay alive,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow,  
The wretched and the meek,  
We gather up our hearts and go,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
Confined to sex, we pressed against  
The limits of the sea:  
I saw there were no oceans left  
For scavengers like me.  
I made it to the forward deck.  
I blessed our remnant fleet  
And then consented to be wrecked,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
I guess they won't exchange the gifts  
That you were meant to keep.  
And quiet is the thought of you,  
The file on you complete,  
Except what we forgot to do,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow,  
The wretched and the meek,  
We gather up our hearts and go,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
The ponies run, the girls are young,  
The odds are there to beat
