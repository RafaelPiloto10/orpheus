Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment  
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight  
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping  
Wide awake, there's some pills that you shouldn't take  
  
Honest to God, X is always an unknown  
I said alright, Y gets buried in your bones  
I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest  
You don't have to stay around, you don't have to solve for X  
  
I'm afraid I found it's eternally unequal  
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight  
On the way back down, finally a sequel,  
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight  
  
Is it alright, and your exit's always an unknown  
It's hard to hold on too tight, 'cause I got buried with your bones  
And I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest  
All your reason gone tonight, you don't have to solve for X  
  
Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment  
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight  
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping  
Wide awake, there's some pills that I shouldn't take  
  
And I said alright, X is always an unknown  
I tried to hold on too tight but I got buried with the bone  
And I said honest to God, I got to get it off my chest  
I don't want to stick around, 'cause I don't need this suffering
