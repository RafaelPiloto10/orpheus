Where is your inspiration, you lost it, oh so long ago  
so much for innovation, I saw this coming long before  
You had no motivation, your hopes are high but trapped below,  
This constant competition, we've won but your still keeping score  
  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
Your think I won't ever get to far.  
  
So high on dedication, it feels so good to get away,  
From all this repetition, this angry town, this battleground  
So now we'll break tradition, we'll leave you swimming in our wake  
Without your inspiration, you can survive, you'll surely drown  
  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
Your think I won't ever get to far  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
You think I won't ever get to far  
Where is your inspiration, you lost it oh so long ago
