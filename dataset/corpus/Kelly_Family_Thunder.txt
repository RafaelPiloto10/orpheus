  
  
I came down to see you  
But you were never there  
You were always lonely somewhere  
I came down to love you  
But you were never there  
But you're always parting somewhere  
  
Hold on, don't leave me lonely  
Hold on, don't leave me lonely  
Hold on, don't go without me  
  
Tell me what's the game now  
Cause I'm feeling kind of jealous  
You're going out with friends now somewhere  
  
I'm gonna get my guitar  
And strum down all the pain  
I think I'm going crazy, beware  
  
Old on, don't ...  
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you  
Gonna let nobody love  
  
Thunder bloody bloody thunder  
Bloody thunder is on its way  
Thunder bloody bloody ...  
  
I came down to see you  
But you were never there  
You just left me lonely somewhere  
  
Hold on, don't ...  
  
I'm gonna le nobody, gonna let nobody love you  
Gonna let nobody love
