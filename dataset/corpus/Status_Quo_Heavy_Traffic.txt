Everybody's been a long time talking  
Ain't nobody said a word that's true  
Ain't it time to stop this crap type talking  
Won't you tell us what you're gonna do  
  
Tell you what why don't we break this pattern  
Tell you what why don't we do some do  
All together we can make it happen  
Untogether and we won't get through  
  
Want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I can't get no-where  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic is bringing me down  
  
Every time I see the red light burning  
Don't it always make the air turn blue  
But until we see the red light turning  
There ain't nothing anyone can do  
  
We all dream about an open highway  
Making dreams is all that we can do  
We'd be moving on if I had my way  
Nothing can stop me getting back to you  
  
Want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I can't get no-where  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic coming into this town  
  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive but I can't get no-where  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
I want to drive yeh drive  
I want to drive I gotta get somewhere  
Heavy traffic is bringing me down  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
  
Heavy traffic all over this town  
  
Heavy traffic coming into this town  
  
Heavy traffic
