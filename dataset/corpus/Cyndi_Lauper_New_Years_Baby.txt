When I first saw you you looked alien  
Like someone in mid dance  
Like a little old man  
When you first held me in your tiny grip  
You seemdd just like popeye  
With your cap and your souint  
  
Chorus:  
shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies  
no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way  
and i'll take this old man by the hand  
to begin again... To begin again...  
  
When I first looked into eyes like mine  
I wondered what I learn  
To see through them in time  
When you first smiled with your toothless grin  
You broke my heart break open  
All the flood gates rushed in  
  
Chorus:  
shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies  
no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way  
and i'll take this old man by the hand  
to begin again... To begin again...
