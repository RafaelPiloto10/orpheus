Met a woman, she had a man  
Couldn't help it, I had a plan  
Right around midnight he was gone  
Saw her red light, she left it on  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh, now she's mine  
If there's a reason for these chains  
It's like we suffer to ease the pain  
Now I got this feelin' inside of me  
My heart's in jail and I can't break free  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine
