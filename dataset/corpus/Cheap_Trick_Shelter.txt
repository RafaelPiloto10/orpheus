If I had a child  
I would shelter it from harm  
If I had a child  
I would hold it in my arms  
If I had a child  
I would love it as my own  
If I had a home  
  
If I had a mom  
I would shelter her from harm  
If I had my mother  
She would never lose her grace  
If I had a mother  
She would shelter me from harm  
Oh, if I had a mom  
  
If I had a love  
I would shelter it from a broken heart  
If I had a heart  
I'd surrender it to my love  
  
If I had my father  
He would smile  
If I had my dad  
He'd be so kind  
If I had a dad  
He would tell me I was good  
Oh, if I, if I  
If I had a dad  
Had my dad
