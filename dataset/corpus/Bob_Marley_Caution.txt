Here I am, walking down the street  
(walk walk walk walk walk walk walk)  
And the terrain, everything is so sweet  
(woah woah woah sweet)  
(woah woah woah sweet)  
I'm doing my thing and I'm doing it slow  
But there is just one thing I would like you to know, oh  
When it wet it slippery yeah  
When it dump it crumpy  
If it's likely you will tumble down  
Don't want you on the ground  
Oh oh oh caution, the road is wet  
Black soul is black as jet  
Do you hear me  
Caution the road is hot  
You got to do better than that  
Cause ah  
When it wet it slippery (when it wet it slippery yea)  
When it damp it crampy (when it damp it crampy)  
If it's likely you were tumbling down  
Don't want you on the ground brother  
Hit me from the top  
You crazy motherfunky  
Hit me from the top  
You crazy motherfunky  
Hit me from the top  
You crazy motherfunky  
When it wet it slippery yeah  
When it dumpy crumpy  
If it's likely you were tumbling down  
Don't want you on the ground (don't don't)  
Caution the road is wet  
Black soul is black as jet (black soul)  
Caution the road is hot  
You got to do better than that
