Too big to fly, dodo ugly so dodo must die,  
Doggo with fear on its side, can't change, can't change the tide.  
Dog baiter, agitator, keeps asking questions, says he wants to know why.  
Ain't no reason that money can't buy.  
Mink he pretty so mink he must die, must die, must die.  
  
Sun he giving life in his light,  
Part of the system,  
Friend to man, friend to the trees,  
No friend to the snowman.  
Where does he go, what does he do?  
Does he meet with the mole, the stream, the cloud  
And end up at the bottom of the sea.  
  
Fish he got a hook in his throat,  
Fish he got problems  
Where does he go, what does he do?  
Does he hope he's too small, to poor a haul,  
Who'll end up being thrown back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.  
  
Caretaker, horror movie,  
Only one eye, only needs one boot,  
Sweet lady, she knows she looks good  
Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute.  
  
Big noise, black smoke  
So pig-headed couldn't see the joke.  
But it ain't funny  
Ask the fly on the wall  
It's only living  
It don't matter at all, at all, at all.  
  
Pimp, he make you drool and grunt,  
He got an answer.  
One he got a dream of love,  
Deep as the ocean.  
  
Where does he go?  
What does he do?  
Will the siren team with Davy Jones,  
And trap him at the bottom of the sea?  
  
I'm back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.
