Nobody believes that I really care for you  
They don't think my heart is true  
I don't think you agree  
You know I'm a lifetime guarantee  
So, if they ask you what you mean to me  
  
Don't call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing, mmm  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything  
  
Nobody believes we got something they ain't got  
They've never seen a fire this hot  
They never got that far  
Burning as bright as any star  
So, if they asked you what your feelings are  
  
Don't call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing  
So, don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything  
  
Feels so good  
Holding tight  
Through the night  
Ah, but they can call it what they like  
But they ain't got it right, no, no, no  
  
So, don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing  
  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything, baby, please  
  
Don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing, yes we do, baby  
  
Don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing  
  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Ooh, ooh  
Don't call it love, ooh, ooh  
Got a better thing
