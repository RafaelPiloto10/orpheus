How many times do you hear it?  
It goes on all day long  
Everyone knows everything  
And no one's ever wrong  
Until later  
  
Who can you believe?  
It's hard to play it safe  
But apart from a few good friends  
We don't take anything on faith  
Until later  
  
Show don't tell  
Show me don't tell me  
You've figured out the score  
Show me don't tell me  
I've heard it all before  
Show me don't tell me  
I don't care what you say  
Show me don't tell me  
  
You can twist perceptions  
Reality won't budge  
You can raise objections  
I will be the judge  
And the jury  
  
I'll give it due reflection  
Watching from the fence  
Give the jury direction  
Based on the evidence  
I, the jury  
  
Show me don't tell me  
Hey, order in the court  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's try to keep it short  
Show me don't tell me  
Enough of your demands  
Show me don't tell me  
Witness take the stand  
Show me don't tell me  
  
Show me don't tell me  
Hey, order in the court  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's try to keep it short  
Show me don't tell me  
I don't care what you say  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's see exhibit A
