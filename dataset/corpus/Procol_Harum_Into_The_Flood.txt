Tell you how the story stands  
I'm a victim in your hands  
Got me pleading on my bended knees  
That's the way the picture reads  
It's a horror show  
It's a body blow  
And it's gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Well give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Into the flood  
  
Now you've made a big mistake  
Spoiled the icing on the wedding cake  
Killed the goose that laid the golden egg  
This time babe you're going to have to beg  
It's a crying shame  
It's a dying flame  
And it's gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Yeah, into the flood  
  
So you pulled the perfect crime  
Turned the water into wine  
  
Got me on my bended knees  
Now's the time to make me squeeze  
  
Came in from the freezing cold  
Turned the glitter into gold (from the barbican)  
  
It's a bloody mess  
It's a body-blow  
And it's gone too far
