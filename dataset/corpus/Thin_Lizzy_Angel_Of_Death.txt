Oh my God  
There's millions of them  
  
I've seen a fire start in Frisco  
The day that the earth quaked  
I've seen buildings a-blazing  
Throwing up in flames  
  
I heard men, women and children  
Crying out to their God for mercy  
But their God didn't listen  
So they were burned alive  
  
They went down, down, deep underground  
In the great disaster  
  
I was hanging out in Berlin  
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine  
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers  
March right across the Maginot line  
  
I've seen two world wars  
I've seen men send rockets out into space  
I foresee a holocaust  
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race  
  
Down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher  
By the name of Nostradamus  
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century  
An angel of death shall waste this land  
  
A holocaust the likes of which  
This planet had never seen  
Now, I ask you  
Do you believe this to be true  
  
I was standing by the bedside  
The night that my father died  
He was crying out in pain  
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy  
  
His body was riddled with a disease  
Unknown to man so he expected no cure  
But before he died that night  
He was lost, insane  
  
He went down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
You'll go down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
I think they've got now
