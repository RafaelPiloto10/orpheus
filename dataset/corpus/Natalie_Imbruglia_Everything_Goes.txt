You live your life, you live like an island  
Satisfied, you live for the moment  
Here you come, you make it look easy  
I bet you smile in your sleep, are you smiling at me?  
You live your life, you live like an island  
Surrounded by water and silence  
Mm, there you go, you make it look easy  
I bet you laugh at yourself, are you laughing at me?  
'Cause sometimes anything goes  
When you're looking at me  
And sometimes everything goes  
When you're looking at me  
So come on, come on, everything goes  
When you're looking at me  
Come on, come on, everything goes  
Sometimes when you're smiling at me  
Come on, come on, everything goes, come on  
You live your life, you live like an island  
What is it like? I wish I could hold it  
Mm, there you go, making it look easy  
I bet you like how it feels but do you feel me?  
So come on, come on, anything goes  
Come on, come on, everything goes  
Come on, come on, everything goes  
'Cause sometimes anything goes  
When you're looking at me  
And sometimes everything goes
