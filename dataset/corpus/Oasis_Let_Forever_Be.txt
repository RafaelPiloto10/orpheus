And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?  
  
How does it feel like to make it happening?  
And how does it feel like to be with everything?  
And how does it feel like to let forever be?  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?
