There was a girl who loved a biker  
She used to follow him across America  
But the biker didn't like her.  
  
She didn't care, she still persisted  
Though her brother said she was twisted  
And the family said they wouldn't miss her  
Anyway.  
  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Gazing at his picture everyday.  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Slowly watching precious water drip away.  
  
She did her best to fix a meeting  
She pulled it off one night in Hollywood  
When he met her he couldn't let her get away.  
  
He didn't ask for her permission  
He took advantage of her position  
But he was always her ambition  
Anyway.  
  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Gazing at his picture everyday.  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Slowly watching precious water drip away.  
  
The family tried so hard to find her  
They Showed Her Picture across America.  
But No Trace Of Her Sweet Face  
Was Ever Found.  
  
She Loved The Biker Like An Icon  
Gazing At His Picture Everyday.  
She Loved The Biker Like An Icon  
Slowly Watching precious water drip away.
