I heard her sing in tongues of silver  
I heard her cry on a summer storm  
I loved her, but she did not know it  
So I don't think about her anymore  
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it  
So I don't think about her anymore  
  
If three and four was seven only  
Where would that leave one and two?  
If love can be and still be lonely  
Where does that leave me and you?  
Time there was, and time there will be  
Where does that leave me and you?  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
I'd tame him down and ride away.  
If I had a flyin' schooner  
I'd sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day  
  
Pretty songs and pretty places  
Places that I've never seen  
Pretty songs and pretty faces  
Tell me what their laughter means  
Some look like they'll cry forever  
Tell me what their laughter means.  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
I'd tame him down and ride away.  
If I had a golden galleon  
I'd sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day
