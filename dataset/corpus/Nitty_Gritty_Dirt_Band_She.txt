She  
She came from the land of the cotton  
A land that was nearly forgotten  
By everyone  
  
And she  
She worked and she slaved so hard  
Big old field was her backyard  
In the Delta sun  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Oh my, she sure could sing  
  
And he  
Looked down and he took a little pity  
Whole town swore, he decided  
He would help us out  
  
And he  
Didn't mind that she wasn't very pretty  
'Cause deep inside his heart he knew  
She was the only one  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Hey, she sure could sing  
  
She had faith, she had believing  
She led all the people together in singing  
And she prayed every night to the Lord up above  
Singing, "Hallelujah"  
  
They  
Used to walk, singing songs by the river  
Even when she knew for sure  
She'd have to go away  
  
She  
Never knew what a life was to give her  
Never had to worry about it  
For one single day  
  
Oh my, she sure could sing  
Oh yeah, she sure could sing  
  
She was singing, singing, "Hallelujah"  
  
And she  
She came from the land of the cotton  
A land that was nearly forgotten  
By everyone  
  
And she  
She worked and she slaved so hard  
The big old field was her backyard  
In the Delta sun  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Yeah, she sure could sing  
Oh yeah, she sure could sing  
Yeah, she sure could sing
