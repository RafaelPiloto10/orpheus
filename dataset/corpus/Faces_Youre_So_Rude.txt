My mom she likes you, she thinks your swell  
Got the makings of a dance hall girl  
Your low cut frock and your birds nest hair  
Stepping up heels and the way that you smell  
She says to take you back  
To see my folks again on Sunday  
  
Why it looks as though there's nobody in  
They've all went out to see my Auntie Renny  
Don't you worry you just come right in  
I'm sure we'll pass the time 'til they come home  
Well let me take your coat  
Take off your shoes, warm your toes, try the sofa  
  
It's getting dark we'll miss the late night bus  
It's only eight but I'm not taking any chances  
What's that noise why'd they come back so soon  
Straighten your dress you're really looking a mess  
I'll wet my socks pretend we just got caught in the rain  
Oh you're so rude
