You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance,  
You didn't even want me around.  
And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down.  
  
Do you love me?  
(I can really move, )  
Do you love me?  
(I'm in the groove.)  
Now do you love me?  
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)  
Watch me, now.  
(Work, work)  
Ah,work it out baby.  
(work, work)  
Well, you're drivin' me crazy.  
(work, work)  
With just a little bit of soul, now  
(work!)  
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist,  
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?  
Tell me,  
(Tell me,)  
Tell me.  
  
Do you love me?  
(I can really move, )  
Do you love me?  
(I'm in the groove.)  
Now do you love me?  
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)  
Watch me, now.  
(Work, work)  
Ah,work it out baby.  
(work, work)  
Well, you're drivin' me crazy.  
(work, work)  
With just a little bit of soul, now  
(work!)  
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist,  
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?  
Tell me,  
(Tell me,)
