Auschwitz, the meaning of pain  
The why that I want you to die  
Slow death, immense decay  
Showers that cleanse you of your life  
  
Forced in  
Like cattle  
You run  
Stripped of  
Your life's worth  
Human mice, for the Angel of Death  
Four hundred thousand more to die  
Angel of Death  
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead  
  
Sadistic, surgeon of demise  
Sadist of the noblest blood  
  
Destroying, without mercy  
To benefit the Aryan race  
  
Surgery, with no anesthesia  
Fell the knife pierce you intensely  
Inferior, no use to mankind  
Strapped down screaming out to die  
Angel of Death  
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead  
Infamous butcher,  
Angel of Death  
  
Pumped with fluid, inside your brain  
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes  
Burning flesh, drips away  
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil  
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs  
How long can you last  
In this frozen water burial?  
Sewn together, joining heads  
Just a matter of time  
'Til you rip yourselves apart  
Millions laid out in their  
Crowded tombs  
Sickening ways to achieve  
The holocaust  
Seas of blood, bury life  
Smell your death as it burns  
Deep inside of you  
Abacinate, eyes that bleed  
Praying for the end of  
Your wide awake nightmare  
Wings of pain, reach out for you  
His face of death staring down,  
Your blood running cold  
Injecting cells, dying eyes  
Feeding on the screams of  
The mutants he's creating  
Pathetic harmless victims  
Left to die  
Rancid Angel of Death  
Flying free  
  
[ Angel of Death  
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead  
Infamous butcher,  
Angel of Death  
  
Angel of Death]
