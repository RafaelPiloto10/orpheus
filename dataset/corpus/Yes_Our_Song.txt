Toledo was just another good stop  
Along the good king's highway  
My fortification took me by surprise  
And hit me sending me sideways  
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine  
Can't help thinking  
  
Singing the Rule Britannia  
And this is where it grabs you  
There's method in the key of see  
Toledo's got to be the silver city  
In this good country  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
That stuff of syncopation  
  
Ever tried driving it to golden heights  
Just simply jiving it  
My mystification it got a  
Jewel skies crazy spacing it  
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices  
Singing speechless  
  
Touching of the healing heart  
So this is where we really start  
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions  
As long as music plays its part  
Good good part  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
It's good clear syncopation  
  
Treat it good  
Treat it rightly  
And if you get it flowing  
The harmony is glowing  
So get ready  
So get ready  
Don't go toledo toledo don't go  
Music  
Good to you  
Music  
Good to you
