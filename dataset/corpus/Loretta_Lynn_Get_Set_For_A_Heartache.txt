It wasn't very long ago that he held me so close  
But the little love he had has died for me who loved him most  
He left me for another and didn't say goodbye  
And if you're next to love him then you'll be next to cry  
Get set for a heartache that's all I can say  
Get set for a heartache on its way  
[ fiddle - steel ]  
He'll make you think he loves you too but you'll find it's not true  
You'll learn that when you need him most he'll be with someone new  
Your love will all be wasted that's how it was with me  
And soon heartaches will tell you you're just his used to be  
Get set for a heartache that's all I can say  
Get set for a heartache on its way
