It was late in the early spring, when we picked out the rings  
We said 'I do' and took off on our honeymoon  
The seashore sure was nice, we made love day and night  
We were so much in love, we never got out of the room  
  
Then spring time turned to fall and I was proud and walkin' tall  
She was happy but mad 'cause she couldn't fit into her dress  
I spent all of my afternoons fixin' up our extra room  
For a boy named Bill or a little girl named Tess  
  
And it was late on a winter night, we were sittin' by the fiery light  
And she said to me, "Hun, I think it's time to go"  
Oh, I was a nervous wreck, I almost broke my neck  
Tryin' to back up the car and hurry through the snow  
  
But I got her there just in time and they dressed us both in white  
And I held her hand while they wheeled her into the room  
And there right before my eyes the miracle of life  
Came cryin' at me and I'd never felt so good  
  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
I never knew that my life was so empty and so incomplete  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
She looks like her mama but she's smilin' just like me  
  
Ooh, what a wonderful woman I'm lovin'  
I'm holding her tender and she's given me everythin'  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
She looks like her mama but she's smilin' just like me  
  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
I never knew that my life was so empty and so incomplete  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me
