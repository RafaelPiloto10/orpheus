She'll hang the baskets on the walls  
Don't you know I've seen it all before  
She'll hang the baskets on the walls  
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer, come fall  
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor  
  
He'll go to buy her Turtle Wax  
But in his mind, he won't be coming back  
She'll hang the baskets on the walls  
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer, come fall  
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor  
  
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer, come fall  
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor  
  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall  
She'll hang the baskets on the wall
