Whenever I'm with you  
Something inside starts burning  
And I'm filled with fire  
  
Stop this, it's got a hold on me  
I said this ain't the way it's supposed to be  
  
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart  
(It's like a heatwave)  
I can't keep from crying  
(Heatwave)  
Tearing me apart  
  
Whenever he calls my name  
Sounds so soft sweet and plain  
I feel this burning pain  
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me  
Is this the way love's supposed to be  
  
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart  
(It's like a heatwave)  
I can't keep from crying  
(Heatwave)  
Tearing me apart  
  
(Ooh, ooh heatwave)  
(Ooh, ooh heatwave)  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)  
  
So I'm starin' into space  
Tears all over my face  
I can't explain it  
Don't understand it  
I ain't never felt like this before  
  
Well that funny feeling has me amazed  
I don't know what to do  
My head's in a haze  
I got the heatwave  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Oh, he's gonna love her)  
(Yes he's gonna love her)  
Yeah, yeah  
(Oh, he's gonna love her)  
(Oh you know he's gonna love her)  
Don't pass up this change, it could lead to romance  
Oh, heatwave  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah,  
Oh heatwave  
Oh, yeah  
Heatwave, yeah, heatwave  
Burnin' burnin' burnin'  
Heatwave, yeah, heatwave  
Burnin' burnin' burnin'
