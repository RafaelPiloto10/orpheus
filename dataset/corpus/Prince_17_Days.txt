Called you yesterday  
You didn't answer your phone  
The main drag is knowing that  
You probably weren't alone  
  
So here I sit in my lonely room  
Lookin' for my sunshine  
But all I've got is two cigarettes  
And this broken heart of mine  
  
So let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
  
You've been gone seventeen days  
Seventeen long nights  
The main drag is knowing that  
You're holding someone else tight  
  
I want to to call you everyday  
And beg you to be near me  
But I know your head is underwater  
I doubt that you could hear me  
  
So let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
  
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Seventeen days  
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Seventeen days  
  
Called you yesterday  
You didn't answer your phone  
If you're the one who's always lonely  
Then I'm the one who's always alone  
  
So here I sit in my lonely room  
Lookin' for my sunshine  
All I've got is two cigarettes  
And this broken heart of mine  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
  
Why don't you answer your phone?  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
Seventeen days  
  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down  
Let the rain come down, down  
Seventeen days
