Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Poor Adam alone in Eden  
Taking off his shoes  
Tired of running around all morning  
From his animal interviews  
He awoke with a hand on his brow  
Askign who are you  
They spent the rest of their lives together  
Making their debuts  
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues  
Some say one thing, some say two  
Ain't much about it anyone can do  
Keep on walking till my soles wear through  
Wearing away my shoes  
Evening comes and the sky turns red  
Clouds of colors cover up our heads  
Ain't it something just to lie here in bed  
Just me and you  
Oh Mary, wrapped up in glory  
What are you going to tell your groom  
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding  
What will your friends assume  
Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married  
The angels carried the news  
What the Lord has joined together  
The world must not undo  
Thene's a wedding down at the church this morning  
Let's uo wish them well  
It's a beautiful day for getting married  
I hope the weather lasts as well  
It's been years since we've been married  
I know we paid some dues  
Now ain't it something just to lie here together  
Just me and you  
Outlasting the blues
