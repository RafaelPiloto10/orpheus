[Verse:]  
There's a gleam in your eyes, Marie  
And the meaning is plain to see  
But you'll find romance is a game of chance  
That is not all it seems to be  
[Refrain:]  
Marie, the dawn is breaking  
Marie, you'll soon be waking  
To find your heart is aching  
And tears will fall as you recall  
The moon in all its splendor  
The kiss so very tender  
The words, "Will you surrender  
To me, Marie?"
