[Verse 1 - Paul Cain]  
Damn ma  
I love you like a lie  
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high  
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye  
Kept it a hundred with you... what give you the right to lie?  
We in two different spaces, and you done turned gemini  
Completely changed faces  
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places  
You'll never find another me, face it!  
  
[Broadway]  
My life ain't sweet  
I don't know who told you that?  
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that  
Walk slow with that  
I'm the same, ain't changed  
But the hate where home is at  
Got me like damn, where my homies at?  
Fuck it, it's just me  
Can't hold me back  
You just can't bite the hand that feeds you  
Especially when the hand's illegal  
I got you cold  
Consider it a lesson learned  
I'm guessing it was just my turn  
To learn the hard way  
You can't always trust the ones you love  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too...  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused  
  
[Verse 2 - fabolous]  
You got to take the good with the bad  
Love what you got, remember what you had  
Always forgive but never forget  
Learn from mistakes, but never regret  
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet  
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet  
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met  
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset  
I got the least out of something I put the most into  
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to  
You remind me of somebody that I used to know  
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before  
And I don't like that bitch  
We go from belly  
I don't like that shit  
Who's gonna fill your space  
That's still a case  
Ben franks the only familiar face  
Get money  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused  
Cause that can't be love  
You took advantage of a good thing  
And that ain't a good thing  
Take it how you want  
  
[Verse 3]  
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her  
The nights she was goin through it  
Crying on my shoulder  
And did a 360 it's like she got colder  
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her  
But I'm a rider  
She used to be my roller  
I guess the general just lost his best soldier  
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her  
She mean to me more  
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her  
  
[Hook]  
Oh yeah I think I remember you  
Yeah mmm ahhh probably not  
You look so familiar too  
But you just wouldn't do this to me  
I know you just wouldn't do this to me  
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
