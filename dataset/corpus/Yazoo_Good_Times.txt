Sometimes I feel,  
I'll never belong  
I want to get there so bad  
But it's taking so long  
Sometimes I feel  
Like letting go  
But when it comes right down to it, baby  
Who wants to know? (no-one)  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I find (for a good time)  
I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)  
Now I find (for a good time)  
I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)  
  
Standing on the outside  
I'm looking in  
Trying to be heard  
I don't know where to begin  
Help me baby show me how  
To be a part of it all and all  
Right here, and now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hands are full of silver  
My pockets full of gold  
It's time I'm trying to spend  
And I can't get myself sold  
I'm a bargain honey  
I'm a giveaway  
And you can have it all  
If you'd use up my day.  
  
[Chorus]
