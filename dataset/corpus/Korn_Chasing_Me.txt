I'm thinking of  
Thinking all the fucked people  
Thinking all the shit I love  
They are all the things I've made  
Straight from my heart  
Begging all the saint people  
Burning is the same evil  
Somehow making me feel sane  
Waiting all this time  
I've got nothing to hold on  
But the phases of my life  
I can see before I'm gone  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking me  
I realise I'm taking everything  
And the shit seems to follow  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I'm hate to be  
All along I seem to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
I'm thinking of  
Making all the fucked people  
Making the bitches I love  
Make them die and go away  
Pain from the start  
All my dreams are ripped apart  
Thinking all the fucked people  
They are all the things I've saved  
Waiting all this time  
I've got nothing to hold on  
But the faces of my life  
I can see before I'm gone  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking me  
I realise I'm taking everything  
And the shit seem to follow  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I'm meant to be  
All along I seem to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
Your life, I hate it  
Oh God, can I reclaim?  
Stop and help me  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking me  
I realise I'm taking everything  
And the shit seems to follow  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I'm meant to be  
All along I seem to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
The shit seems to follow
