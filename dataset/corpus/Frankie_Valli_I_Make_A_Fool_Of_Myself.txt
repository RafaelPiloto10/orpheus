When I'm away from you  
I know what to say and do  
But every time you're near  
My courage disappears ah-ha  
The words are on my lips  
When my composure slips  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ah-ha  
Don't know if I'll get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
Hey little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl, you're unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh I'm crying  
  
Lord above please let me see  
She's the life and breath of me  
How my heart is breakin'  
When I'm sleepin', wakin'  
I keep making a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ah-ha  
Don't know if I'll get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
Oh little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl, you're unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh I'm crying
