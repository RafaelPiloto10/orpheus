[Chorus: x2]  
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way  
All my life, riding dirty on the highway  
All my life and it all changed in one day  
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on  
  
The hood never caused but they all was hard  
His kind never represented love at all  
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars  
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage  
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start  
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god  
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top  
Access granted with this empty can of starch  
No not the Bentley liquor store got robbed  
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block  
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars  
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage  
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large  
I wrote XXL in the view of my squad  
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall  
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow  
Cause  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
A four course meal every first of the month  
Everybody in the projects family home  
Don't know you till the DJ like I want some  
But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun  
Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1  
Without the struggle probably never would'a heard of Lebron  
Try and juggle in the casket wit ya sister Lavonne  
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue  
Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song  
Yeah it could of been tragic for the boy from the scums  
Yeah he got the craft-matic no rest till I won  
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone  
Born near the savages kinda made me numb  
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung  
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs  
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum  
Cause  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Sitting here, reminiscing,  
Of all the nights I had to grind  
Taking chances with the system,  
I put my whole life on the line  
All my life know it ain't been sweet  
All my life I been in the streets  
All my life up against concrete  
All my life mama gave me the speech  
All my life somebody died every week  
All my life ducking the police  
All my life without soda I weeped  
All my life no first class seats  
  
[Chorus: x2]
