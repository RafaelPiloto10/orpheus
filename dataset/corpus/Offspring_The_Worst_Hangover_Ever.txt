Went out drinking late last night  
I had a blast  
But now the morning light has come  
And kicked my ass  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
  
And by my seventh shot  
I was invincible  
I would have never thought  
I'd be this miserable  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm rolling back and forth on the bed  
I'm worked so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
  
Won't someone just kill me  
And put me out of my misery  
I'm making deals with God, I'll do anything  
Make it stop please!  
Make it stop please!  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
I'll probably never drink again  
I may not ever drink again  
At least not 'til next weekend  
I'm never gonna drink again
