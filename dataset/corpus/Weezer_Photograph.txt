If you want it (oo-oo-oo)  
You can have it (oo-oo-oo)  
But you gotta learn to reach up there  
And grab it (oo-oo-oo)  
  
'Cause everybody wants some love (oh baby)  
Shoot it from the stars above (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I can take  
I can never get enough  
  
If you need it (oo-oo-oo)  
You should show it (oo-oo-oo)  
'Cause at my place overnight  
Suggest you grow it (oo-oo-oo)  
  
'Cause everybody wants some hope (oh baby)  
Something they can barely know (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I could take  
I can never let it go  
  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph of love  
  
'Cause everybody wants a dream (oh baby)  
Something they can barely see (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I could take  
I could never let it be  
  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph of love  
  
If you blew it (oo-oo-oo)  
Don't reject it (oo-oo-oo)  
Just keep drawing up the plans and re-erect it  
(oo-oo-oo) (x 3)
