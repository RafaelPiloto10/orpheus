Oh Daddy...I'm so alone, Oh Daddy...come home  
Oh Daddy...I've missed you so  
Oh Daddy...tell me what to do  
  
Daddy don't look at me like that  
I didn't do it...HE did...It was HIM  
I could never...I could never  
I wasn't even there  
  
Daddy tell me what to do...Daddy...No don't no  
  
Oh Daddy, you're fading away  
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay  
Oh...you're fading away  
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay  
  
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie  
  
Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep  
  
What am I to do you...with you ?  
  
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie  
  
Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep  
  
What am I to do you... with you ?  
  
Sit down you creep, you degenerate sheep  
  
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie
