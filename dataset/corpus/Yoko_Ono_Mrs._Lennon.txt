Mrs. Lennon, o' Mrs. Lennon,  
Checking the sky to see if there's no clouds.  
There's no clouds,  
O' then, I guess it must be alright.  
  
Mrs. Lennon, o' Mrs. Lennon,  
Making the tea and watching the sea.  
There's no waves,  
O' then, I guess it must be alright.  
  
Silver spoon, o' silver spoon,  
I lost my silver spoon.  
  
And our children, o' our children,  
Did they have to go to war?  
Yes, my love, it's okay,  
Half the world is always killed you know.  
  
Husband john extended his hand,  
Extended his hand to his wife.  
And he finds, and suddenly he finds  
That he has no hands.  
  
They've lost their bodies!  
They've lost their bodies!  
Yes, they lost their bodies.  
  
Neither of them, o' neither of them  
Never left each other.  
Yes, my love, it's okay,  
Half the world is always dying you know.
