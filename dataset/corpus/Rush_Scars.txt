I've stood upon my mountaintop  
And shouted at the sky  
Walked above the pavement  
With my sense amplified  
I get this feeling  
  
All my nerves are naked wires  
Tender to the touch  
Sometimes super-sensitive  
But who can care too much?  
I get this feeling  
  
Scars of pleasure  
Scars of pain  
Atmospheric changes  
Make them sensitive again  
  
Each emotional injury  
Leaves behind its mark  
Sometimes they come tumbling out  
Like shadows in the dark  
I get this feeling  
  
When I think about all I have seen  
And all I'll never see  
When I think about the people  
Who have opened up to me  
I get this feeling  
  
Snow falls deep around my house  
And holds the winter light  
I've heard the lions hunting  
In the Serengeti night  
I get this feeling  
  
Forests turned to factories  
And river, sea, and sky  
Hungry child in the desert  
And the flies that cloud her eyes  
I get this feeling  
  
Pleasure leaves a fingerprint  
As surely as mortal pain  
In memories they resonate  
And echo back again
