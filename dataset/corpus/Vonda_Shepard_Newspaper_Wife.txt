Sitting here in this dirty bar  
Watching the trash go by  
She's selling cigarettes and lollipops  
She's got a sparkle in her black eye  
  
She says "Maybe my time will come"  
Maybe my time will come  
  
He said he'd sweep her off her feet  
Defying all of gravity  
Well she'd move any bright city  
To fill this gaping cavity, she says  
  
I'm a slave in this empty life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
  
Well he must have a very small broom  
As she sits in this very large room  
Maybe it's just a piece of straw  
She says why am I so in awe?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a slave to this empty life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
I'm ashamed of this meaningless life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
  
She sits across from him  
Drinking her coffee  
His face is buried in other people's lives, she says  
"I wonder if he's gonna read forever  
I'm his newspaper wife  
  
[Chorus]
