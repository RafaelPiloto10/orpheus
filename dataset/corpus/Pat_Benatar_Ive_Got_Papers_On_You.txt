I've got papers on you baby  
You gotta do what I say  
I've got papers on you baby  
You gotta do what I say  
I mean business darlin', I'm too old to play  
I've got papers on you baby  
And I mean you're mine, all mine  
I've got papers on you baby  
And I mean you're mine, all mine  
If you do just what I tell you darlin'  
We're gonna get along real fine  
  
Now the red light means stop  
Green light means go  
Tell you something once  
I ain't gonna tell you no more  
  
I've got papers on you baby  
You gotta do what I say  
I got old baby, and I'm too old to play  
  
Well I see that you eat  
And I see that you got a place to stay  
I see that you eat  
And I see you got a place to stay  
But as long as live in this house  
I ain't gonna let you have your way  
  
I've got papers on you baby  
And I mean in black and white  
I've got papers on you  
And I mean in black and white  
  
Now I ain't hard to get along with  
But you just gotta treat me right
