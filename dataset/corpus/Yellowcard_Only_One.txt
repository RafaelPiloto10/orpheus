Broken, this fragile thing now  
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces.  
And I've thrown my words all around,  
But I can't, I can't give you a reason.  
  
I feel so broken up (so broken up),  
And I give up (I give up),  
I just want to tell you so you know..  
  
Here I go,  
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you,  
You are my only one.  
I let go,  
There's just no one that gets me like you do  
You are my only,  
My only one.  
  
Made my mistakes, let you down  
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long.  
Ran my whole life in the ground  
And I can't, I can't get up when your gone.  
  
And something's breaking up (breaking up),  
I feel like giving up (like giving up),  
I won't walk out until you know..  
  
Here I go  
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you,  
You are my only one.  
I let go  
There's just no one that gets me like you do  
You are my only,  
My only one.  
  
Here I go,  
So dishonestly.  
Leave a note  
For you my only one.  
And I know,  
You can see right through me.  
So let me go  
And you will find someone.  
  
Here I go,  
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you,  
You are my only one.  
I let go,  
There's just no one, no one like you  
You are my only,  
My only one.  
  
My only one  
My only one  
My only one  
You are my only,  
My only one.
