You could see me reaching,  
So why couldnt you have met me halfway  
You could see me bleeding  
But you could not put pressure on the wound  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself.  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico  
  
You could see me breathing  
But you still kept your hand over my mouth  
You could feel me seething  
But you just turned your nose up in the air  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico
