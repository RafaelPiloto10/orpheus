She can't hide no matter how hard she tries  
Her secret disguise behind her lies  
And at night she cries away her pride  
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside  
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night  
All her family asking if she's all right  
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell  
But all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself  
  
She can only fool herself for so long (3x)  
She can only fool herself  
  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
When it comes to how to live his life  
He can't be told  
Says he's got it all under control  
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with  
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit  
An addict and he can't hold the reigns  
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same  
Tries to slow down the problem he's got  
But can't get off the carousel  
Until he makes it stop  
  
He can only fool himself for so long (3x)  
He can only fool himself  
  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you  
  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
