When he came out to the lock-up  
He said I'm looking for something better  
He made his shock announcement  
And backed off, backed down, backed off  
  
And then he got up off the floor  
He said I'm wealthy enough, not to do this no more  
And he made it all known with his hands held up, palm out  
  
And she said don't know if I should  
'Cause I worry too much about the tests on the blood  
And at first it was a 'yes', and then a 'no', then a 'yes'.  
  
A maggot sleeps on her desk  
H wears a sleeping bag as his vest  
And he's getting too too bothered  
About the spots on his chest, chest, chest  
  
Now TT, she laid it on  
And a few days later she's gone  
So it's back to the womb  
To get drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned warm (?)
