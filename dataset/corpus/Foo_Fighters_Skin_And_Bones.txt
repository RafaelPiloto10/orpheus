Lately I've been measuring  
Seems my time is growing thin  
Wind me up and watch me spin  
Watch me spin  
Watch me spin  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
I'm just skin and bones  
  
All worn out and nothing fits  
Brennivin and cigarettes  
More I give the less I get  
But I'm all set  
I'm all set  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
  
Deep within this frame of mine  
Heart of hearts a valentine  
Tell my mom I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Don't you know?  
  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones  
I'm just skin and bones
