Once I had a secret love  
That lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love  
Became impatient to be free  
  
So I told a friendly star  
The way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are  
And why I'm so in love with you  
  
Now I shout it from the highest hill  
I even told you the golden dafodill  
At least my heart's an open door  
And my secret love's no secret anymore  
  
Now I shout it from the highest hill  
I even told you the golden dafodill  
At least my heart's an open door  
And my secret love's no secret  
My secret love's no secret  
My secret love's no secret anymore
