[Chorus:]  
Keep on chooglin'  
Keep on chooglin'  
Keep on chooglin'  
Chooglin',  
Chooglin'.  
  
Maybe you don't understand it.  
But if you're a natural man,  
You got to ball and have a good time  
And that's what I call chooglin'.  
  
Here comes Mary lookin' for Harry,  
She gonna choogle tonight.  
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer,  
  
He gonna choogle tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(primal screaming)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you can choose it, who can refuse it,  
Y'all be chooglin' tonight.  
Go on, take your pick, right from the git go,  
You gotta choogle tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(more screaming)  
  
Oh, we're Creedence!  
Clearwater!  
Revival!
