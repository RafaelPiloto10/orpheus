Sometimes the ones you hold so close can make you cry  
But it's a pain in the ass to let 'em go  
With a battered wish you hoped that the monkey wore a tie  
But it's no surprise to find he don't  
  
Put the pointed pencil in the pepper-po  
and take a little sniff of the things below  
Bring it to a boil and simmer low  
Put the noodle on the griddle as it climbs the Grobe  
  
Watch the worker shield his heart from the world outside  
Didn't get a chance to let him know  
Alsace is spinning fast and wine mixed with the tide  
Please don't let my brain explode  
  
Put the pointed pencil in the pepper-po  
and take a little sniff of the things below  
Bring it to a boil and simmer low  
Put the noodle on the griddle as it climbs the Grobe
