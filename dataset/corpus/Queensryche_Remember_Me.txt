For just one minute, step into my life.  
Read the page and  
Run away with me.  
The day I made that vow.  
I didn't know then what I know today.  
There's so much to say.  
  
I don't know what the future holds  
And I'm sorry if I seemed too cold.  
A man conflicted in his head  
Makes poor choices, regrets the words he said.  
  
Remember me and all the times we had.  
The way I held you.  
Remember me whenever you feel sad.  
All I want from you  
Is for you to tell me that you miss me.  
Will you wait for me?  
Remember me, please.  
  
Just wait one minute. Give me a chance  
And I'll make you see just what you really  
Mean to me.  
It took a living hell to  
Show me. All I want is to be with you.  
You know that what I say is true.  
  
I promise when I get back home  
I'll be the man you used to know.  
And I won't spend another day  
Without you, girl.  
I need your strength.  
  
Please stay and  
Remember me and all the times we had.  
The way I loved you.  
Remember me whenever you feel sad.  
All I want from you  
Is for you to tell me that you miss me.  
Will you wait for me?  
Remember me.
