Don't get me wrong  
I think I'm in love  
But the feeling in the word is more  
That your crystal eyes will ever see in me  
Don't get me wrong  
Open your eyes  
Although I cannot show my heart  
I'll watch and hope  
While you are near to me  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you  
  
Birds of the sky  
May I borrow your wings  
Very soon I'll ask my love  
To travel with me to the world outside  
Cherry trees, may I borrow your bloom  
Very soon I'll ask my love  
To come inside the nest I'll build alone  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you  
  
Animal friends  
Help me decide  
When should I ask my love to leave  
I'll beg of you that she'll say yes to me  
Breathe in deep  
Now is the time  
She looks at me and gently smiles  
As if she new  
I'd ask her all the time  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you
