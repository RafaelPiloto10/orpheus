You squirt out red and turn so yellow  
And then you made me kill my own  
I'm not afraid  
(Coming, coming)  
But I'm afraid  
  
Blood in your eyes again  
Bravery, the face of man  
Blood on your mind again  
Chivalry, the face of man  
Blood in your lies  
Enemy, the face of man  
Blood in your eyes, again  
  
Is this the only path of glory? If so then I won't go alone  
Follow the trail  
(Running) Follow the trail  
  
I'm not afraid  
But I'm afraid
