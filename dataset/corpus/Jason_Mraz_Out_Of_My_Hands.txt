You went walking away, into the sun  
How romantic  
I knew we were done  
Was it something I said, something I did  
It must be over my head,  
I didn't quite understand it  
Now it's out of my hands, it's out of my hands  
I saw before the way you were feeling about yourself, every day  
Baby you needed me to make it, so you could keep running away  
Was it something I said, something I did  
It must be over my head  
I didn't quite understand it  
Now it's out of my hands  
It's out of my hands  
  
When it feels like life has gotten out of control  
When it feels like much too much to hold  
When it feels like too much to understand  
No, that's out of your hands  
Out of your hands  
Out of your hands  
  
Was it something I said, something I did  
It must be over my head  
I didn't quite understand it  
Now it's out of my hands  
It's out of my hands  
  
When it feels like life has gotten out of control  
When it feels like much too much to hold  
When it feels like too much to understand  
No, that's out of your hands  
Out of your hands  
Out of your hands
