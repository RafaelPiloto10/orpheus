I can't sleep, no not like I used to  
I can't breathe in and out like I need to  
It's breaking ice now to make any movement  
What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion  
  
All at once  
(As I'm trying)  
I can help you out  
(Just to keep things right)  
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything  
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
Goodbye apathy, so long apathy  
  
So don't sit still  
Don't you move away from here  
  
So goodbye apathy  
(As I'm trying)  
So long fancy free  
(Just to keep things right)  
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you  
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
  
I don't walk right, not like I used to  
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you  
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me  
As long as you're close to me  
  
Now that I'm alright  
(As I'm trying)  
I can help you out  
(Just to keep things right)  
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything  
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
Goodbye apathy, so goodbye apathy  
  
So don't you stop pushing me  
I can take so much  
  
So goodbye apathy  
(As I'm trying)  
So long fancy free  
(Just to keep things right)  
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you  
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
Everybody is watching me too  
Everybody is watching you  
Everybody is watching me too  
(I can't sleep)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
(No)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(Not like I used to)  
Everybody is watching you  
(I can't breathe in)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(Not like I need to)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
(It's breaking ice now to make any movement)  
Everybody is watching me too  
Everybody is watching you  
(What's your vice?)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(You know that mine's the illusion)
