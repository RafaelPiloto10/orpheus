You take and you take without giving  
Like the ride is never going to end  
You think you know who's going to Heaven  
Well I know I'm going to see you again  
On Judgement Day  
Others, they walk the bad road  
If you do you better watch what you say  
You think that you can hide in your shadow  
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire, no where to run to, no one to blame  
Cause Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
Some people they call me brother  
Some people they say that they care  
Some people they steal from the Heavens above  
It's going to be a cross to bear  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
With nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Well Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
It's just you and me  
I won't fade away  
Let's face up to the truth  
It's our own Judgement Day  
  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
Nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day
