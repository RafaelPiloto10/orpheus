Words and music by Bob Seger  
Be-side of "Like A Rock" and on the soundtrack to the movie "About Last Night"  
When the sun came up this morning  
And she smiled her smile for me  
I felt it for the first time  
Something deep inside of me  
So you can take your midnight ramblin' boys  
And you can keep your winding roads  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside  
Oh there's an easiness about her  
There's a softness in her way  
But she gets me through the hard times  
We get closer everyday  
I know I'll never be alone now boys  
Cause even if I'm far away  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside  
Yeah  
And I don't know what I did to deserve her  
But I'll tell you this my friend  
I'm never gonna lose her  
Never gonna lose her  
Cause every night  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside
