Goodbye little darling, we're parting  
Parting don't always mean goodbye  
Although we have to part, you're always in my heart  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling, I'll miss you  
Miss you as the stars would miss the sky  
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you so  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling, I'll love you  
Love you until the day I day  
Please dream a dream of me wherever you may be  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Please dream a dream of me wherever you may be  
Goodbye little darling goodbye
