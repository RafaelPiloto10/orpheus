Just another guy that you see around  
No more than a face  
Somewhere in the crowd  
Then when you pass  
I 'm feeling sorrow  
'Cause you're so near  
Yet, you're so far away  
  
I know that I'm a fool for wanting  
What I can't have  
If I say I loved you you'd only laugh  
So each night I'd dream that you're mine  
And wake each morning only to find  
That I'm just another guy  
  
I know in my heart that  
I don't stand a chance  
But I just can't end this one way romance  
  
Maybe someday  
I'll be there by your side  
But if I remain just another guy  
You'll be here in my heart forever  
And I know that darlin' you'll never be  
Just another girl to me
