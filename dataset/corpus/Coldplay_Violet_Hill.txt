Was a long and dark December  
From the rooftops I remember  
There was snow  
White snow  
  
Clearly I remember  
From the windows they were watching  
While we froze down below  
  
When the future's architectured  
By a carnival of idiots on show  
You'd better lie low  
  
[Chorus]  
If you love me  
Won't you let me know?  
  
Was a long and dark December  
When the banks became cathedrals  
And the fox  
Became God  
  
Priests clutched onto bibles  
Hollowed out to fit their rifles  
And the cross was held aloft  
  
Bury me in armour  
When I'm dead and hit the ground  
My nerves are poles that unfold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be a soldier  
With the captain of some sinking ship  
Would stow, far below  
  
So if you love me  
Why'd you let me go?  
  
I took my love down to violet hill  
There we sat in snow  
All the time she was silent and still  
  
[Chorus: x2]
