Two island swans  
They mated for life  
And his faithful heart  
Would not consider any other wife  
  
With three years of peaceful joy  
With the rushes of the pond  
Proud and gentle was the love  
Of the last two island swans.  
  
There love was like a circle  
With no beginning and no end  
With his lady by his side  
A treasure and best friend  
  
And the pond was oh so peaceful  
And the rising of the sun  
Young and free as the island breeze  
Their lives had just begun  
  
Till a dark day in November  
With the seering cold that starts  
Stalked the hunter with his bow  
And put an arrow through her heart  
  
[Chorus]  
And the cold wind blow  
He was brave but he lay low  
By her body in the isle of mist  
I saw her give him one last cold kiss  
One last cold kiss  
  
Now swans like people  
Talk of only one in this fair side  
Though they brought him 20 ladies  
He would take no other bride  
  
And they say he will not move  
From the place where she did fall  
Once so proud he's beaten now  
And he will not rise at all  
  
[Chorus]
