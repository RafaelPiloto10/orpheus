The bird is here and we are off  
To wherever those wings take us  
The atmosphere is crawling with airlines  
That wind through the clouds  
And look down at the crowds  
Relax your back and let the noise  
Sing you to sleep in my arms  
If you awake before we arrive  
I will carry you down and I won?t make a sound  
  
The scent is strong as we move on  
And breathe in the pristine crime scene  
The false veneer is old like a sub stick to volunteer  
From oh some other year  
I'm just a shell as far as I can tell  
So I paint my eyes a light green  
The silver beams are twirling and swirling  
Throughout your dreams  
Like air traffic streams
