Hit with the bug to run, you didn't go to college we can use you son  
You look like the pride of your home town  
But how can you hold out when your luck is down  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.  
Because I'm too tired to run around  
Meeting people from the wrong side of town  
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money nothing to give, listen  
All you gotta do is look around for something that's new  
find a job that's stimulating, that's easy and I'm still waiting  
  
(Chorus)  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day,  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day.  
Got brains but got no drive  
Money's cheap, the roads are wide  
All the good positions go too fast  
I need a job I know will last  
I've got a job for you can you push that shovel can you swing that broom  
Keep your head down and don't go slow  
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.  
(Chorus
