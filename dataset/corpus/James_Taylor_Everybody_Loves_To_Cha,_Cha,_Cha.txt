Took my baby to the hop last night,  
What to my surprise,  
When we got there she hit me  
With the news right between the eyes  
She said she couldn't do the cha, cha, cha.  
  
I told her not to worry now,  
They'd play some other dance,  
But we sat there for an hour and a half  
And we never got a chance  
Cause every song they played  
Was the cha, cha, cha.  
  
I told her not to worry,  
There's still one thing we can do,  
Let me take you by your hand tonight,  
I want to teach this dance to you.  
I taught my baby how to cha, cha, cha.  
  
We kept on dancing for an hour or two,  
What do you think I'd see?  
We hadn't practiced for a time or two around,  
She was doing it better than me.  
You know my baby loves to cha, cha, cha.  
  
Everybody loves to cha, cha, cha.  
Little children love to cha, cha, cha.  
Everybody loves to cha, cha, cha.  
Sam Cooke himself in the midnight hour.  
Everybody loves to cha, cha, cha.
