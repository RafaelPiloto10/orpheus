Written by Redd Stewart and Pee Wee King  
Additional verse: Leonard Cohen  
  
I was dancing with my darlin'  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened to see  
Introduced him to my loved one  
And while they were waltzing  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
Now I know just how much I have lost  
Yes I lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.  
She comes dancing through the darkness  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
And I feel like I'm falling apart  
And it's stronger than drink  
And it's deeper than sorrow  
This darkness she's left in my heart.
