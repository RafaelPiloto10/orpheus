I'm not some long lost someone  
Just dropped in to say hello  
It's that same old lover man  
Baby you lost so long ago  
'Cause I was born to believe  
I never could deceive, believe me  
I hear no children's voices  
Have they gone back to school  
And that same old lover man  
Is still acting like a fool  
I guess I was born to bring you grief  
Though I never was a thief, believe me  
It's cold outside your window  
Please let me in, the night is wild  
It's that same old lover man  
Not some lonesome winsome child  
An' I was born to believe  
I never could deceive
