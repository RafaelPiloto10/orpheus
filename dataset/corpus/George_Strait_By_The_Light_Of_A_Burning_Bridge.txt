Oh, I've been stumblin' through the darkness  
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet  
Afraid of movin' much in any direction  
Stuck where the past and the future meet  
  
But I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it too  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of  
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then  
But when I really make myself get honest  
It's over and I can't go back again  
  
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind  
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind  
  
When I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge
