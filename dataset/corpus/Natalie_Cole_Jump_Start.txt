Alright y'all  
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah  
Feels like my battery's in need of a jump  
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump  
Give me a spark to get the fire burning  
A get my engine moving, set these wheels a turning  
Our love could use some rejuvenation  
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation  
Romance is here to stay, I'll testify 'cause I need some today  
  
So won't you  
Jump start my heart  
Charge me up when I'm running down  
Oh, jump start my heart  
Lift my feet up off the ground  
  
When it comes to loving, Baby  
Can't get enough, hot wire me  
Satisfy me, don't give me up  
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning  
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me calling  
Can't let this feeling just slip away  
Our love was meant to last forever and a day  
We can't neglect what we cherish the most  
So drop your foolish pride 'cause I need you more and more  
(Nothing good comes easily)  
Ooh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right  
(You see I love you so) I'll (I'll never let you go) never let you go  
(I want to hug you) Oh (and kiss you, keep you right here with me)  
  
So won't ya jump start my heart  
Oh, charge me up when I'm running down  
Would you do that for me, Baby  
Jump start my heart  
Hey, lift my feet up off the ground  
  
Oh, don't let me down  
Jump start my heart  
Woo, charge me up when I'm running down  
Would you do that for me, Baby  
Jump start my heart, hey, hey  
Lift my feet up off the ground  
Mm, don't let me down (Jump)  
Don't step on me now  
Alright let's uncross (Jump) those wire  
When I say hit it, y'all hit it  
Ignition, ignition  
  
Give it a little gas y'all, come on, ou!  
Ooh, Baby (Jump) uh, oh, uh, oh, oh  
I say don't stomp hard, Baby (Jump,Jump)  
(Jump) Lift me up  
Take it on up (Jump start my heart, my heart) y'all  
Oh, ooh (nothing good comes easily)  
Ooh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right  
You see I love you so I'll never let you go  
(I want to hug you) yeah (and kiss you) yeah (keep you right here with me)  
(Jump start my heart) Ooh (charge me up when I'm running down)  
Oh, don't let me down

Lift me up, lift me (Jump start my heart)  
Oh, do (charge me up when I'm running down) that for me, Baby  
Oh!

Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart [Repeat: x4]  
  
Get it, get it y'all  
Musical Interlude Continued
