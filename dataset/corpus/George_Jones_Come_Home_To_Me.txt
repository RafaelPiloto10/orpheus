Lyin' here thinkin' and I happen to think  
Blamin' myself for the things that I said  
Hoping that you soon forget and forgive  
My life without you ain't no way to live.  
  
Come home to me, come home to me  
It just won't be right till you do  
Come home to me, come home to me  
I can't take one more night all alone  
Come on home.  
  
Baby, you left a hurtin' only your love can heal  
And I understand that's how I made you feel  
Well, my life without you would just fall apart  
Right from the body come my lonely heart.  
  
Come home to me, come home to me  
It just won't be right till you do  
Come home to me, come home to me  
I can't take one more night all alone  
Baby, come on home.  
  
The moon through the window  
Is my shade of blue  
As I'm holding your pillow  
Longin' for you, baby.  
  
Come home to me, come home to me  
It just won't be right till you do  
Come home to me, come home to me  
I can't take one more night all alone  
Come on home.  
  
Come on home
