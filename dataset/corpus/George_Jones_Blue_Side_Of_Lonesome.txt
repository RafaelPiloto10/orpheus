I'm calling to tell you it's over yes darling you're now free to go  
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me but you can hurt me no more I know  
You're asking me where this call comes from oh I hope that you won't interfere  
  
If your new romance turns out a failure here's where to find me my dear  
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel  
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well  
  
The floor's got a carpet of sorrow but no one can weep in the aisle  
And they say someone broke the bar mirror with only the ghost of a smile  
The hands of the clock never alter for things never change in the place  
There's no present no past and no future we're the ones who have lost in
love's race  
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome...
