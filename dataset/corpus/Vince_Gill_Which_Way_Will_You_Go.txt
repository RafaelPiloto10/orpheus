Baby, you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer  
I hear your man's been out there runnin' 'round  
You're hell-bent to even up the score  
  
Don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
Your hands are shakin' and your knees are weak  
Pistol pointed at the door  
You're tired of wearin' bruises on your cheek  
Bein' treated like a whore  
  
Don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Well, Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
And don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Well, Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
Oh, Heaven only knows  
  
Baby, you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer
