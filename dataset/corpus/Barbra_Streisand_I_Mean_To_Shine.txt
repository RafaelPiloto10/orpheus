Here comes another dawn  
For every child to see  
This time the morning sun  
Is burning just for me  
I've got the skyward eyes  
Like I've never had before  
Just smile and say goodbye  
  
Show me to the door  
For every one there comes a precious time  
To break away  
I mean to shine  
Oh, I mean to shine  
As I look at all the morning sun  
I know I mean to shine  
  
This day I realized  
The world I knew is gone  
New seasons come and change  
The crown that stood upon  
I've been afraid to feel  
And scared of falling free  
You said so I'm real  
It seemed so clear to me  
For everyone who breathes  
There comes a time to fly away  
  
I mean to shine  
0h, I mean to shine  
As I look at all the morning sun  
I know I mean to shine  
For everyone who breathes  
  
There comes a time  
To break away  
I mean to shine  
Oh, I mean to shine  
As I look at all morning sun  
I know I mean to shine.
