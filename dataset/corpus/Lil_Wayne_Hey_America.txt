Hey  
I remember da way  
We would both say  
We be together  
Forever and a day  
Well I guess dat day  
Came sooner den late  
Cus now  
We're apart and away  
And it feels so stray  
N.g.e. wouldn't you say  
I use to  
Call u bay  
And u use to obey  
And I just wish we could  
  
"Do it again" [x3]  
  
Hey  
I got my business together  
Wish I could get together  
But timing is an error  
And I  
Tell a lie  
To you like ever  
If I was even ever  
Given another chance to  
  
"Do it again"  
  
Like I died  
And gone to heaven  
Climbed inside a treasure  
Died inside of pleasure like  
Wow  
Your smile is but of essence  
Your child is so precious  
I wish  
It was paternally mine  
But karma is a message  
But imma try to test it  
And scream for a blessing  
So loud  
And I hope that you would catch it  
And one day you would come fallin  
Out of the most highest cloud  
Then I'll be there to catch you  
Yes  
I'll be there to let you  
Do da things  
We didn't do before  
Now  
Next time we have to stretch it  
Do it never forget it  
I never forgot  
I wish dat we could  
  
"Do it again" [x3]  
  
Hey  
I'm just trynna talk to you  
If I could talk to you  
Den I would talk  
Forever and a day  
Yes I remember  
So vividly  
How we would be  
When we lay  
And my then blue skies  
Were no longer gray  
She so brightened up my day  
Put it on a scripture  
She would be a picture  
If perfect had a face  
I promise you homie  
Dat u would be hungry like me  
If you had a taste  
I put it on my momma  
Cus baby girl is a flower  
A flower without a vase  
No water needed at all  
She continues to grow  
More beautiful everyday  
And I love her somethin vicious  
And I'm just wishin  
We could  
  
"Do it again" [x3]
