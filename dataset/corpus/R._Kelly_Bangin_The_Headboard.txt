Feel so freaky  
I feel so freaky  
Listen  
  
There's something about the way you look at me  
And it's got me imaginin' and seein' things  
Like us both in a room  
At my domain  
About to blow up and  
And hit like a hurricane  
And I can't take it no more  
And you can't fake it no more  
Playin' hard to get girl  
Please leave that thought outside the door  
Cause the truth of the matter is that you want me and I want you up  
So let's quit playin' around and get our ass up under this cover  
(ooh)  
There's so many things I want to do to you  
(ooh)  
There's so many things I want for you  
(ooh)  
On this night I'll make sure you won't regret it  
What you and me did in this bed  
  
Girl we'll be bangin,' bangin, bangin', b, b,bangin',  
The headboard  
Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',

Banging', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',

And ooh (ooh) it feels just like we're floatin' in this pool  
And the water bought this fire out of you  
And there ain't no other girl on this earth I choose  
Baby but you  
And I'm going to rock that body fast to sleep  
(Girl once you have had enough)  
And you goin' to give that body back to me  
(As soon as you wake up)  
Startin' back all over again  
Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth wind  
Til the mornin' comes  
I'm goin' to be in (yeah)  
  
(ooh)  
There's so many things I want to do to you  
(ooh)  
And there's so many things I want for you  
(ooh)  
On this night I'll make sure you won't regret  
What me and you did in this bed
