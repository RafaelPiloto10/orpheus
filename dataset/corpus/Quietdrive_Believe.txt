A city under the gun  
A smoking gun  
Frozen wasteland we are on  
I see the lights  
Flames ignite  
Cigarettes that I don't own  
I've seen them bleed  
Watched them beg  
Walked to where the sidewalk ends  
Recycled bars, brand new cars  
Better find that cabby quick  
  
Drinks for free  
When you're with me  
  
Believe  
That you're always on my mind  
Believe  
That you got here just in time  
I'm not listening, no  
I'm not listening, no  
That you're always on my mind  
Not this again  
  
Dim the lights  
The city ignites  
Silent boycott of our lives  
We are the town  
The time is now  
Got one chance to paint it red  
  
Every night, start a fight  
Find a count to make it right  
Take a shot, make it grip  
Gonna shoot one from the hip  
  
Drinks for free when you're with me  
If you're down with me  
Then you must believe  
  
Believe  
That you're always on my mind  
Believe  
That you got here just in time  
I'm not listening, no  
I'm not listening, no  
That you're always on my mind  
Not this again  
  
Take what you need to take  
Jump  
It's not far away  
Run, run, run to me  
They will never catch us  
They'll never catch us  
  
Take what you need to take  
Jump  
It's not far away  
Please come back to me  
They will never catch us  
They'll never catch us  
  
Believe  
That you're always on my mind  
Believe  
That you got here just in time  
I'm not listening, no  
I'm not listening, no  
That you're always on my mind  
Not this again
