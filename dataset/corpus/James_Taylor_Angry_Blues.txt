I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
If I had my way, I'd be sitting on the top of the world.  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
  
When the anger comes in  
And there's no place for a man to hide,  
When the anger comes in  
And there's no place for a man to hide,  
Would he do anything in the world  
To make him feel better inside?  
When the anger comes in  
And there's no place for a man to hide.  
  
Gonna sit back here,  
And watch this cloud roll by.  
Gonna sit back here,  
And watch this cloud roll by.  
The next time that you see me  
I should be shining like the Fourth of July.  
Gonna sit back here,  
Gonna watch this cloud roll by.  
  
I ain't looking for details,  
Won't you just give me a clue?  
Oh, Lord, what am I gonna do?  
  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
If I had my way, I'd be sitting on the top of the world.  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.  
Don't feel so good,  
I can't help it if I don't feel so good.
