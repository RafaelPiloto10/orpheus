Here we are,  
Back in the sunshine again  
No more worries,  
No more pain  
  
Well we're leaving behind, all our trouble and strife  
That's the way it's gonna be, oh, the rest of my life  
  
Well here we are, here we are, back in the sunshine again  
No more worries, no more worries, no more pain, no more pain  
  
Life's too short to spend it lonely, you only throw it away  
Listen to your voice of reason, yeah call it a day, ay, ay, ay  
  
Take a ride, take a ride, out to the land of the free  
Don't hurry, take your time, take your time  
Come spend it with me, ooooh  
Back in the sunshine (2X)  
  
Here we are, back in the sunshine again  
No more worries, no more worries, no more worries  
And no more pain  
  
Life's too short to spend it lonely, you only throw it away  
Listen to your voice of reason, you call it a day, ay, ay, ay  
  
Here we are, back in the sunshine again  
No more worries, no more worries, and no more pain  
  
Here we are, here we are, yeah we're back in the sunshine again  
No more worries, oh no and no more pain  
  
Why, why, we're back in the sunshine again  
No more worry or pain  
Yeah we're back in the sunshine again
