Can't nobody love you like i do  
Not now, no not ever  
There ain't no doubt i know this thing  
We have, could last forever  
  
Others may promise the stars in the sky  
But sooner or later you'll find  
Can't nobody love you like i do  
  
Can't nobody hold you quite this close  
All night like i want too  
Baby put your sweet lips here on mine  
You'll see 'cause i'm gonna show you  
  
Just how an angel like you should be loved  
I can't feel you enough  
Can't nobody love you like i do  
Can't nobody love you like i do  
  
Who knows when it's meant to be  
Well love knows and it sent you to me  
  
You don't know how i live for the day  
You look at me and you say  
Can't nobody love you like i do  
Can't nobody love you like i do  
Can't nobody love you like i do
