I found your letter in my mailbox today  
You were just checking if I was okay  
And if I miss you, well you know what they say  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
No need to ask me if we can be friends  
And help me right back on my feet again  
And if I miss you, well just now and then  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
There's a blue moon shining  
When I am reminded of all we've been through  
Such a blue moon shining  
Does it ever shine down on you?  
  
You act as if it doesn't hurt you at all  
Like I'm the only one who's getting up from a fall  
Don't you remember now don't you recall  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
Just once in a very blue moon
