I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna write words so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got them  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feelin' better"  
And close with love  
The way you do  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you
