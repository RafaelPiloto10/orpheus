Danny says we gotta go.  
Gotta go to Idaho  
But we can't go surfing  
Cause it's twenty below.  
  
Sound check's at 5:02.  
Record stores and interviews.  
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow.  
  
Baby  
Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go  
And it may sound funny, but's true.  
Hangin' out in a hundred  
Be watching 'Get Smart' on TV.  
Thinkin' about.  
You and me and you and me.  
  
Hangin' out in L.A.  
And there's nowhere to go.  
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow.  
Listening to Sheena on the radio.  
Oh-ho oh-ho.
