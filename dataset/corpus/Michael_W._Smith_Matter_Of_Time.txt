If I could, I would tell you why  
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky  
I turned to stone, and I could not speak  
She had the ability to make me weep  
  
Always wishing, always hoping  
That she'll get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Let's together share forever  
It's just a matter of time  
  
I had to wait and just let her breathe  
That's never been easy for a man to see  
She moved slow and she took her time  
She kept me guessing what was on her mind  
  
Always wishing, always hoping  
That you'd get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Let's forever be together  
It's just a matter of time
