[Sean kingston]  
I was just a player in the game of love  
Til she came and turned me tables around  
Stacking up mi chips  
Lining up all mi cups  
Still they all came tumbling down  
  
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one  
Take them stealing me up on the run  
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done  
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum  
Fly me away, the kingdom come  
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
  
Love was just a word till I bought me a baller  
Oh you everything for holding me down  
I'm telling all my homies that mi find mi a queen  
In the jungle so you facing the crowd  
  
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one  
Take them stealing me up on the run  
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done  
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum  
Fly me away, the kingdom come  
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
I'm saying Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
If you will die then why would you try  
And if you apply, a suit and a tie  
It's what I will buy then you will be mine  
Because you and I, we're born to be wild  
I am Martha, you King Arthur  
Who knew you would land me  
I be known to eat these rappers, cook 'em like chef Ramsey  
Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice  
Cove on vogue, yeah I'ma go topless  
I'ma go bonkers, I'ma go crazy  
I'ma get reckless then have a baby  
Then hang a baby off on the balcony  
Teach him the moonwalk, Tell him he's japanese  
Yeeeahhh!  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
Ooooh, I'm blown away
