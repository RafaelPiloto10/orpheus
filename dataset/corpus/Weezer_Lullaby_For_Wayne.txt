Summer 1988  
Never though you'd graduate  
Playin with your guns all day  
  
If only they could see you now  
And how you've learned to shoot so well  
They wouldn't talk that way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wayne, you know it's true  
There's nothing you can do  
So put those guns away  
Who cares it's wrong or right  
So please give up the fight  
And put those guns away  
  
All of your freinds are through  
They've given up what they tried to do  
See now how happy they are  
  
Each with a new lease on life  
A brand new car and a milage wife  
Doo doo doo doooo doo doo...
