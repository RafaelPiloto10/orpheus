Well there are people  
Never receiving  
Anything from God at all  
Oh, they are shaken  
From their believing  
When they don't see results  
They quickly fall  
  
But don't you waver  
Keep on living  
In the way God wants you to  
Don't get discouraged  
Keep on giving  
Soon it will come back to you  
  
Chorus:  
Keep on casting  
Your bread upon the water  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
Keep on casting  
Your bread upon the water  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
Good measure pressed down  
Shaken together running over  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
  
Keep on working  
Seeking the kingdom  
Instead of working for your needs  
Keep on sharing the love of Jesus  
You know, growing comes from planting seeds  
  
Chorus
