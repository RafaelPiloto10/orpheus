There's a wilderness  
It's a no man's land  
Between alice springs and the ocean  
Seventeen hundred miles of burning sand  
And a silken thread keeps a hold on you  
When the emptieness like a potion tends to fray your reason strand by strand  
And there's no more need for the mask your wear  
When the last goodbyes have been said  
So kiss the cheeks of you dearest friends  
And turn to the desert ahead  
Now you're on your own like a sailing ship  
You're the captain, crew and sailors  
Turn around and this is what you see  
Chorus  
This me facing me all alone  
'cause I choose to be with the wind and the sun on me only me  
Now you dream so much about being lost  
Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping  
Haunts you and whispers in your ear  
Give up give up this lonely road  
No one knows the promise you're keeping  
You can't touch the emptiness out here  
But the grace that mends this broken wing  
The blue sky to regain  
Will lift those feet and raise those eyes  
To face the desert again  
As the dawn reveals the journey's end  
In truth it's only beginning  
And it's as big as your eyes wish to see  
Chorus
