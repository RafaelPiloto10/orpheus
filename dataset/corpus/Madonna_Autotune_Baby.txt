[Verse 1]  
I told you I don't want you all the time  
Cause you're not mine  
I'm not in love, but I'm in light  
So far it's working fine  
But when I need you down, I'm desperate  
I'm a little child  
Just like an animal, down on my knees  
And beggin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me, rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Open the door, unlock me  
We've got tonight, so rock me now  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm in my bed, and I'm obsessed  
And I am wide awake  
I need someone like you to come  
And put me in my place  
Cause in the day, I can't be tamed  
Boy, you don't wanna know  
But in the night, my hands are tied  
You tell me where to go  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me, rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Open the door, unlock me  
We've got tonight, so rock me now  
  
Open the door, unlock me  
We've got tonight, so rock me now  
  
[Bridge]  
Rock me now  
Rock me now  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me, rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me, rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
[Outro]  
You and me, sitting on a tree  
You be the daddy, I'll be the baby
