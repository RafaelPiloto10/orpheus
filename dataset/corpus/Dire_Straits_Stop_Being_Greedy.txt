Uh-huh, uh-huh (x4)  
  
[Hook:]  
Y'all been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy  
Just keep it real partner give to the needy  
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait  
Fuck around and I'm go'a bite you and snatch the plate  
  
[dmx]  
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe  
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo  
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen  
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams  
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me  
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever  
The closest thing to me is gonna get it  
But, never will I, can I think death is wrong  
So i'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone  
You could put that on my nigga boone  
These other rap cats will give a nigga room  
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door  
Headhuntin mother fuckers, stay on the floor  
4-4, that's what I get sick wit rrrrrrr  
Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr

I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift  
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff  
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone  
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone  
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife  
Scratch, shake, and hold all night  
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin  
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin  
But I don't like drama so I say to myself,  
"keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth  
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses  
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses"  
I'm broke so i'ma bash his head wide open  
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin  
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat  
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black  
  
[hook x2]  
  
[dmx]  
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf  
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help  
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside  
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside  
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots, faggot  
You've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops  
One drops, and another and another  
Gun pops, go into you and your mother  
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog  
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue  
Many questions, no answers, just stress  
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed  
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by  
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, why ask why when you know  
Nigga when it's your time to go, you go
