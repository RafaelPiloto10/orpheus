You always give me something  
To help me understand  
Turn those tracks around me one more time  
But all you give is killing me  
  
I can't turn around  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
I don't know who I am on a darker side of town  
I came to win some game I played  
  
When I was just a boy  
I've done too much have nothing in my life  
I understood the rules back then  
Now I can't decide  
  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
I'm gettin' wasted on a darker side of town  
Oh I give to you everything I've got  
Even start again to make you smile yeah  
  
But my luck's run out  
My head is burned  
I can't turn around  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
  
I'm drownin' in some wine on a darker side of town  
Darker side of town
