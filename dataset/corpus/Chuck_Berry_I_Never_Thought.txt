You know I never really thought some things would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I went down in Mississippi, I asked Mister Charlie about my roots  
He said, "Turn around, bend over, boy, they're right here in my boots"  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I asked a policeman the time, he swung and crowned me with his stock  
I managed to walk away so glad it weren't twelve o'clock  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
My girl friend's datin' this here guy who's goin' out with some man's wife  
I lost my girl, the wife her husband, the guy he lost his life  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I used to have a Ford Torino and at that time I had a chick  
She used to get her kicks just askin' me to flick my Bic  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
My grandpa drove a horse and buggy but my father used the train  
I worked and bought a Cadillac but my son, he drives a plane  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me
