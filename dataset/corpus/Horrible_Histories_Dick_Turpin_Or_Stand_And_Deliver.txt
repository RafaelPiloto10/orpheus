Everyone thinks they know the story  
Of Dick Turpin's highway glory  
But my past was far more gory  
Was no saint  
  
You think life is one big antic  
My profession is romantic  
Hate to be pedantic  
But it ain't  
  
HA  
  
As a butcher down in Essex I was handy with a knife  
Had a sideline as a poacher led a less than honest life  
  
The notorious gang of Gregory  
Liked my style and dedication  
They signed me up and gave me  
A real robber's education  
  
We rampaged through the Essex farms  
We stole and robbed and fought  
But when the law came for us  
I escaped and they got caught  
  
I became I highway man  
Was daylight robbery  
  
HA  
  
I was no prince charming  
Nothing dandy about me  
  
HA  
  
The truth is, I was violent  
And with my good mate, Matt King  
Robbed travelers at gunpoint  
Money, watches, anything!  
  
My horse wasn't called Black Bess  
Although that's what you've read  
Was no romantic hero  
Shot not one but two men dead  
  
The legend that surrounds me  
Misses out the crucial part  
I was a ruthless killer  
With a ruthless killer's heart!  
  
Was a vicious highwayman  
A source of pain and tears  
  
HA  
  
When you hear how my story ends  
You won't believe your ears  
  
HA  
  
I ran away to Yorkshire  
Changed my name to John Palmer  
Was sent to prison  
After stealing chickens from a farmer  
  
Wrote a letter to my family  
A plea it did relate  
The postman saw the envelope  
And here's the twist of fate  
  
He had taught me how to write  
So he'd knew I'd lied  
"that's not John Palmer's hand!  
That's Dick Turpin's!" he cried!  
  
Was a vicious highway man  
My crimes had brought me fame  
  
HA  
  
Was stitched up by a postie  
That's not glamorous  
THAT'S LAME!  
  
HA  
  
No more stand and deliver  
You'll remember this I hope  
  
HA  
  
It's no fun hanging with highwaymen  
When you're...  
  
Hanging from a rope!
