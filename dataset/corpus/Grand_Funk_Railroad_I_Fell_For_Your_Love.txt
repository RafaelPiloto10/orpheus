Hey baby so now you're goin', is your mind relieved?  
Did you get what you wanted and have some fun playin' make believe?  
I have never lost so much pleasure, so it's hard to be nice.  
Hey baby feel my hand, ain't it cold as ice?  
  
Chorus  
'cause I fell for your love, when I was out of my mind.  
I fell for your love, and now you tell me it's time.  
To kiss it away, to stand here and say, good-bye.  
  
Can't you understand the way I live?  
Half a love is all that I can give.  
Lonely ladies and empty faces for a long long time.  
And you might be one baby when we meet again and I'll still try to make you
mine.  
  
Chorus  
  
I fell for your love when I was out of my mind.  
I fell for your love when love was so hard to find.  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me it's time,  
To give up my love when it's so damn hard to find.  
  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
I'm so lonely baby.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Them empty faces, all I wanted was you.  
Love is so hard to find.  
  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me it's time,  
Love is so hard to find.  
To stand and say good-bye.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
When it's so damn hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
I fell for your love when I was out of my mind.  
(and so on to fade)
