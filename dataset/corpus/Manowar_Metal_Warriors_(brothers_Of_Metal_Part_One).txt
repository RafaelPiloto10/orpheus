Every one of us has heard the call brothers of  
True metal proud and standing tall we know  
The power within us has brought us to this hall  
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all.  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers,  
Leave the hall, heavy metal or no metal at all  
Whimps and posers go on get out leave the hall.  
Now the world must listen to our decree we  
Don't turn down for anyone we do just what we  
Please, got to make it louder, all men play on  
Ten, if you're not into metal, you are not my friend.  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers,  
Leave the hall, heavy metal or no metal at all  
Whimps and posers I said leave the hall.  
Now the world, ust listen to our decree we  
Don't turn down for anyone we do just what we  
Please, got to make it louder, all men play on  
Ten, if you're not into metal, you are not my friend.  
There's metal in the air, tonite can you hear it  
Call? If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can  
Leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers,  
Leave the hall, heavy metal or no metal at all  
Whimps and posers, leave the hall.
