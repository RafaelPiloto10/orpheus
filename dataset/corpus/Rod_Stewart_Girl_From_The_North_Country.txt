If you're traveling in the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She was once a true love of mine  
  
And if you're goin' when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see for me she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howling wind  
  
Would you see for me that her hair's hanging long  
That it rolls and flows all down her breasts  
See for me that her hair's hanging long  
'Cause that's the way I remember her best  
  
But I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
  
So if you're traveling in the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
'Cause she was once, she was once a true love of mine  
  
And she'll always be a true love of mine  
And I never, never, never, never give her up
