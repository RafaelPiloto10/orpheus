The dawn shines her light to scare off the night  
The sun from his slumber is woken  
And the bells are ringing out as the town crier shouts  
Words too strong to be spoken  
There's a rumble in the ground and the air fills with sound  
Trumpets in the wind are a blowing  
And the townsfolk peep through the curtains of sleep  
To the sound of the cocks all a crowin'  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
The sun wears a smile and the clock winks its dial  
Clouds in the sky are unfolding  
And the birds on the wing like angels they sing  
The heavens are glowing all golden  
The crowds all spill out, they cheer and they shout  
Banners and flags are a waving  
And the flowers all a bloom, blow kisses to the moon  
As blossom falls on the paving  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
The whole world roars a chorus of applause  
Strangers from Delhi to Dublin  
Are swept off their feet as they kiss on the street  
And the waters like champagne are bubbling  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me
