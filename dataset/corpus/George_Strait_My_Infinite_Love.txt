When you see a shooting star in the night  
When you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines  
I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
It'll be me and my infinite love for you  
It's just like I promised you under heaven above  
It will live on long after we kiss goodbye  
Forever by your side  
My infinite love  
  
When you think someone is callin' out your name  
When you feel that kind of feelin' you can't explain  
Now you will know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My infinite love  
My infinite love
