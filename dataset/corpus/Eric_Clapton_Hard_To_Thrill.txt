Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
There is nothin' you can show me  
That I haven't seen before  
I got the time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room  
Time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room  
Over forty years of Fridays  
And you give up tryin' too  
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
I'm hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
There ain't nothin' you can show me  
That I haven't seen before  
Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore
