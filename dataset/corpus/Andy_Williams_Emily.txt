Emily, Emily  
  
Emily, Emily, Emily  
As the murmuring sound of May  
Of silver bells, coral shells, carousels  
And the laughter of children at play  
  
Say Emily, Emily, Emily  
And we fade to our marvelous view  
Two lovers alone and out of sight  
Seeing images in the firelight  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily  
  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily too
