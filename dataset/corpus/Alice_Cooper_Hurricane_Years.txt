I got a ticket to nowhere  
I got no respect for the law  
I got no use 'cause it's all abuse  
It's the cutting edge of the saw  
  
Ain't got no tiime for the future  
Ain't got no time for the past  
I'm running up a down escalator  
I'm going nowhere fast  
  
I'm hanging on like a spider  
Blowing in the wind  
This storm's gonna tear a hole  
Right through this web I'm in  
  
[Chorus:]  
Thunder lightning  
The wind outside is so damn frightening  
But it's alright, all right  
Stand clear  
You're living in the hurricane years  
In the hurricane years  
  
I've been through major destruction  
I've seen through terrorists' eyes  
Sometims I feel no emotion  
Sometims I break down and cry  
I need to walk on a wire  
I need a layer of skin  
I need a preacher breathing fire  
To burn away my sins  
  
And I can't help the victims  
On the side of the road  
And I can't stop the cyclone  
That's about to explode  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn my eyes to heaven  
Watching all the clouds roll by  
I see the blood moon rising  
I know I'm way too young to die  
  
[Chorus]
