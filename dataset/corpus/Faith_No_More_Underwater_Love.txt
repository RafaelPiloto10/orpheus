Looking down into the water  
It's hard to make your face  
If our love is drowning, then why  
Do I feel so out of place?  
Bubbling up to the surface  
Are you getting a breath of fresh air?  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I can't escape your stare...  
Liquid seeps into your lungs  
But your eyes look so serene  
It's wonderful how the surface ripples  
But you're perfect, and I cannot breathe  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I can't escape your stare  
Hold me closer, keep me near  
I'll never get enough  
Touch me from below  
I'll never let you go  
But I can't escape
