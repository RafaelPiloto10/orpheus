She packed her bags and moved to Florida  
I've been blue since she's been gone  
And this bowling green motel room  
Is now my old Kentucky home  
All she left me was some whiskey  
And these funny cigarettes she rolled  
It must have been her main intention  
To watch our dreams go up in smoke  
It's another blue grass morning  
I'm gonna blow my mind away  
In this smoke old motel room looks  
Like it's gonna be another blue grass day  
She's soakin' up the sun in Florida  
I'm smokin' up this motel room  
She's sippin' drinks down by the ocean  
I'm guzzlin' blue Kentucky moon  
It's another blue grass morning...
