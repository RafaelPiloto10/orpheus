Stand Up  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Now when I was just a little child  
Enrolled in elementary school  
That big 'ol teacher  
Would ask me a question  
And I'd sit there  
Trembling like a fool  
So I asked my daddy,  
I said, What's wrong with me?  
He said, Son, if you know the answer  
This is how it's got to be  
He said  
Chorus:  
You've got to stand up  
And be counted  
You've got to raise your hand  
And let them call your name  
You've got to stand up  
If you want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever be ashamed  
The next day at school  
The teacher asked a question  
And she shot a look my way  
And I stood right up  
And I said, Teacher  
There's something  
That I've got to say  
You know the grass below is green  
And the sky above is blue  
And Columbus found this country  
In 1492  
You need to stand up  
And be counted  
You've got to raise your hand  
And just let them call your name  
You've got to stand up  
If you want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever be ashamed  
Now I believe the Lord  
He's looking for someone  
Who's gonna stand up  
For the Church  
And he wants you to stand up  
On the street  
And where you go to school  
And where you go to work  
And in a world filled with darkness  
That's surrounded by the night  
Someone needs to stand up for Jesus  
And start to shine that Light  
We need to stand up  
And be counted  
We need to raise our hands  
And start to praise His matchless Name  
We need to stand up  
If we want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever, ever, ever  
Be ashamed-
