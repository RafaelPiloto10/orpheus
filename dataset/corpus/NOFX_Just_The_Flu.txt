Looking back to the past,  
Predictions of the end  
Unseen ultra violet rays  
Are beating on my head  
Nuclear threat want to bet will be our demise  
The day will come when we'll look to apocalyptic skies  
  
When the news had spread, that soon we'd all be dead  
Well it just blew our minds  
No one could have guessed that our worst fears at best  
Figments of our time  
  
So it seems that our dreams will never come to be  
How can such a stupid thing destroy humanity?  
A few weeks till extinction and there's nothing we can do  
A message sent to other worlds will say "It was just the flu"  
  
There's no lesson to be learned  
There's no one left to learn it
