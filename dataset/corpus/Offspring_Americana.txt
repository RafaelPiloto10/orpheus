Well i'd like to tell you all about my dream, it's a place  
Where strip malls abound and diversion's mere moments away  
  
Where culture's defined by the  
Ones least refined  
And you'll be left behind  
If you don't fit in  
It's all distorted  
In americana my way  
  
Well my dream has come true  
My vision has come true  
  
Now give me my cable, fast food, four-by's, tat's right away  
I want it right now cause my generation don't like to wait  
  
My future's determined by  
Thieves, thugs, and vermin  
It's quite an excursion  
But it's okay  
Everything's backwards  
In americana my way  
  
Well my dream has come true  
My vision has come true  
  
I'm a product  
Of my environment  
So don't blame me, i just work here  
  
My rights are denied by  
Those least qualified  
Trading profit for pride  
But it's okay  
Everything's backwards  
In americana my way  
  
My nightmare has come true  
My nightmare has come true  
Yeah, it's all coming true
