A woman's touch, a woman's touch  
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much  
She's a wizard, she's a champ  
And she doesn't need a lamp  
  
A woman's touch can weave a spell  
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well  
With the magic of a broom  
She can mesmerize a room  
  
With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there  
And a dustpan for the cinders  
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there  
She can polish up the winders  
  
Then presto chango  
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through  
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?  
How d'you do?  
  
It makes you blink, to stop and think  
A woman and a whisk-broom  
Can accomplish so darn much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch  
  
A woman's touch can quickly fill  
The empty flower boxes on a window sill  
One smile from her and zoom  
Little buds begin to bloom  
  
A touch of paint, a magic nail  
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale  
Even make the lamp appear  
Like a crystal chandelier  
  
With a tack tack here and a tack tack there  
And a hand around a hammer  
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there  
You can give a cabin glamour  
  
Then gosh, almighty, all at once  
The cabin that we knew  
Becomes a shining castle built for two  
Me and you  
  
The pies and cakes a woman bakes  
Can make a fella tell her  
That he loves her very much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch
