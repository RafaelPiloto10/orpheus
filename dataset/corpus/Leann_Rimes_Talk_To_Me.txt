I can tell you've been crying on the inside  
I can see right through your eyes, what you're to hide  
You've got a real big wall covering up what you're feeling for me  
Well, c'mon baby, work it on out and talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
  
I can tell you've been hurt real bad before  
But you're face to face with love knocking at your door  
All your need is al little trust to set you free  
Well, here I am, don't hold back, baby talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
  
I cried a tear  
As I felt the pain  
That you hold inside  
But this true love is strong enough to survive  
C'mon and talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me
