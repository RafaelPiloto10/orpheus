Pour shame all over us  
Harden into a crust  
Cement  
Forget the glamor and  
Mumble a jackhammer  
Under your breath  
Hide your face in the curtains  
Better unsaid, so close  
And it rolls off the tongue  
Almost!  
The world expects the pose  
Perfectly natural  
Loosen up  
Smearing wet concrete  
And swearing you'll never be  
Caught  
At your weakest, etched in stone  
And we're frozen here, peeking  
Almost, sweet talk, caffeine  
Make contact  
Up to my neck  
I confess in quicksand  
"But it's so easy for you"  
"There's always one thing"  
"Do you have something to tell me?"  
"Say something"  
"Anything"  
I'm warning you  
I'm warning you  
I'm fucking you  
I'm warning you  
"Relax"  
"It's just a phase"  
"You'll grow out of it"  
Believe anything anyone ever tells you  
It's not funny anymore  
It's thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate ALMOST
