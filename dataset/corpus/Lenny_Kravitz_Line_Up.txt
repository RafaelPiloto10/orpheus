If you think that you're strong  
Wanna fight well come on and line up  
When the going gets tough  
And your talk ain't enough, line up  
  
We gotta get up, get out before  
They get us down  
'Cause livin' up against the wall, yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up  
So don't be surprised  
When they pull the wool over your eyes  
Yeah, don't get funked up  
  
If you got all the stuff  
And you can't get enough then line up  
If you're out on a limb  
And you wanna come in then line up  
  
Your heads down, sittin' round  
Pick yo face up off the ground  
And get yourself together baby  
And learn to stand tough  
Come on and line up  
  
We better get to it instead  
Of just standing around  
Its time to get down  
  
If you're playing to win  
Then your only way in is line up  
If we all wanna live  
Then we all gotta give, line up
