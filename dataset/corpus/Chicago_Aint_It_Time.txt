Oh what a lucky day  
Things are going my way  
Sun is arising mesmerizing everything I say  
People all around this uptight town  
Someone's gonna recoginze me  
Ain't it time  
Dues I've been paying for so long only making me stronger  
Lady luck won't you please come to me I can't wait any longer  
I spend all my time writing notes and rhyme  
Tryin' to find new dimensions  
Ain't it time  
Time for movin' on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everything's okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar  
Competition everywhere is getting all of us down  
I've been makin' all the rounds I feel like a train on the wrong track  
Don't get lost 'cause you might get caught going out  
The wrong door now  
Ain't it time  
Time for movin' on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everything's okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar
