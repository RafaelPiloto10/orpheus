When you left me, I didn't cry, but my heart was heavy  
As heavy as lead  
I sit there thinking with no thoughts in my head  
I could not be comforted, by the living or the dead  
  
[Chorus]  
So I keep on dreaming to communicate  
And I keep on dreaming if that's what it take  
Keep on dreaming, it's never too late  
Keep on dreaming, cause that's what it take  
  
I see you in my visions, and it seems you're right here  
I wish I didn't have to wake up, but here comes the light of day  
It's been too long now, since you went away  
Won't you come back, so we can play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I knew it wasn't over, it was only the start  
Cause I see the light that shines in the dark  
The questions have answers, my love isn't lost  
Fate put us together, so nothing can tear us apart  
  
[Chorus]
