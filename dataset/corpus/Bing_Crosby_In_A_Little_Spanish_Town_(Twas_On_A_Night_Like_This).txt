Feat. The Buddy Cole Trio  
  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
Twas on a night like this  
  
I whispered, be true to me  
And she sighed, si, si  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this
