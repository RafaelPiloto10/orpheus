Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up  
And how do we spend our lives if there's no-one to lend us a hand  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Are not right  
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,  
Would you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up  
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Just don't make it right  
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,  
Do you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night
