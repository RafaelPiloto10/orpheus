Do you believe in heaven above  
Do you believe in love  
Don't tell me a lie  
Don't be false or untrue  
It all comes back to you  
  
Open fire on my burning heart  
I've never been lucky in love  
My defences are down  
A kiss or a frown  
I can't survive on my own  
  
If a girl walks in  
And carves her name in my heart  
I'll turn and run away  
Everyday we've all been led astray  
It's hard to be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Empty dreams can only disappoint  
In a room behind your smile  
But don't give up, don't give up  
You can be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now
