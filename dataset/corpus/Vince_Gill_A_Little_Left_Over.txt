I work my fingers to the bone  
But you won't hear me cry and moan  
A workin' man don't need no welfare line  
  
Well I'll never be a millionaire  
And frankly I don't even care  
'Cause all I need to have a real good time  
  
[Chorus]  
Is a little left over  
On Saturday night  
If my bills are paid my plans are made  
And everything's alright  
Put on my ropers and them wranglers fittin' tight  
Got a little left over  
And it's Saturday night  
  
I don't drink but I love to dance  
With those sweet young things in their cowboy hats  
These country girls will be the death of me  
If that's the way I gotta go  
Lord I hope I die real slow  
'Till I do I'll tell you all I need  
  
[Chorus]
