  
Rush Limbaugh don't know shit about,  
"The Way Things Ought To Be"  
Let's over throw the government,  
Leave everything to me  
I've got a plan, yea  
You could call it a vision.  
I'll be the dictator  
And make all the decisions.  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
I've always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
This is my America  
One nation under me.  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
I've got a plan to deal with all the  
Sickos on death row,  
Gladiator fights'll  
Be your new favorite show  
Confiscate the crack babies  
From the hospitals,  
Micro-chips in their brains make  
Cyborg soldiers of 'em all  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
A hedonist police state  
From sea to shining sea  
This is my America,  
That's how it gonna be,  
This is my America,  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
Concentration camps  
For everyone I think's a jerk  
That'll be most everyone  
And they'll do all the work  
Dissidents are put to death  
Nightly on the tube  
Executions will continue  
Until morale improves.  
This is my America,  
That's how its gonna be,  
I've always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America,  
That's how its gonna be,  
This is my America,  
One nation under me  
This is my America x 8
