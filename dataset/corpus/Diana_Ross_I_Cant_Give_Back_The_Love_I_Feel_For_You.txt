Here's a tear, for a souvenir  
And a dream, that's torn at the seams  
Here's a promise you made to me  
Of the tomorrow I'll never see  
And then you're free to go  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these arms that held you close  
I thought I was the one you needed the most  
Take these hands, they're no good to me  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
Here's a ring  
That didn't mean a thing  
And the letters you wrote  
That gave my young heart hope  
Take the pillow where my dreams were made  
And the mind, where the thought of you stayed  
But baby, you should know  
  
That I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these eyes that once could see  
Now reflections of a misery  
The hapiness I thought would last  
Now a becoming just a thing of the past  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
No, I can't give back  
No, I feel for you  
Oh, I'm gonna be stuck  
No matter what I do  
'Cause it'll grow 'til the world  
Don't go 'round no more  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do
