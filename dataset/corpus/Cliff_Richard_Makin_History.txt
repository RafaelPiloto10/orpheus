Tonight there's a magic that i can't explain  
Tune-up and start the show all set now ready to go  
This band's gonna really rock tonight  
Steppin' out upon the stage  
Under those lights again  
We're gonna shake the place tonight  
They gotta new song high in the charts you know  
You must have heard them play it on the radio  
When that flat top starts that picking  
Hear the bass drum start that kicking  
The joint is really jumpin' now  
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel  
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down  
It's a strange kinda magic that never seems to age  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory  
That is rock'n'roll  
Rock on  
They gotta new song  
High in the charts you know  
You must have heard them play it on the radio  
Hear the start and the jumbo gibson  
You don't know what you're missing if you're not  
Painting the town tonight  
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel  
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory  
That is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory that is rock'n'roll  
Mama it's so exiting-oh oh  
Don't you find the beat exiting
