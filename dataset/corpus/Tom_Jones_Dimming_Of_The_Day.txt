This old house is falling down round mice  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone, you can hear me pray  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my bed aside  
  
The days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise for a broken heart  
Now all the bonny birds, have flown away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
Come tonight you're only what I want  
Come tonight you can be my comfort doll  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night, we can steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day
