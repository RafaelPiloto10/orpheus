Well, it's a strange way  
The way you look at me  
And it's a hard time  
Time you been givin'  
Open up to me  
So you can realize  
That I could set you free  
Strange ways, twisted days  
Strange ways, twisted days  
Well, it's a strange place  
That you've been livin' in  
And it's a strange line  
You've been deliverin'  
I think I like it  
But I'm not really sure  
Don't want to to fight it  
Just want to feel some more  
Strange ways, twisted days  
Strange ways, twisted days  
Strange ways, twisted days  
Strange ways, twisted days
