As I was walking down the street,  
Down the street, down the street,  
A pretty little gal I chanced to meet,  
Oh, she was fair to see.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I stopped her and we had a talk,  
Had a talk, had a talk,  
Her feet took up the whole sidewalk  
And left no room for me.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I asked her if she'd have a dance,  
Have a dance, have a dance,  
I thought that I might have a chance  
To shake a foot with her.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin',  
And her heel kept a-knockin', and her toes kept a-rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin'  
And we danced by the light of the moon.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.
