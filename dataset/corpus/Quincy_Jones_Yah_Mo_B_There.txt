Heavenly Father  
Watchin' us fall  
We take from each other  
And give nothing at all  
Well, it's a doggone shame  
But never too late for change  
So if your love runs low  
Just reach and call His name, His name  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Whenever you call  
Never be lonely  
Lost in the night  
'Cause run from the darkness  
Lookin' for the light  
'Cause it's a long hard road  
That leads to a brighter day, hey  
Don't let your heart grow cold  
Just reach out and call His name, His name  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
(Yah Mo B there)  
Yah Mo B there  
(Whenever you call)  
Yah Mo B there  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
You can count on it, brother  
'Cause we're all just findin' our way  
Travelin' through time  
People just got to keep pushin' on  
No matter how many dreams slip away  
Yah Mo B there  
Well, it's a doggone shame  
But never too late for change  
So if your love runs low  
Just reach and call His name  
(Just call His name)  
Yah Mo B there  
(I'll be there)  
Yah Mo B there  
(When you need Me)  
Yah Mo B there  
(And I will catch You when you fall)  
Yah Mo B there  
Yah Mo B there  
(Yah B there)  
Yah Mo B there  
(Whenever you call, whenever you call Me)  
Yah Mo B there  
(Yes, I will be there)  
Yah Mo B there  
(I will be right there)  
Yah Mo B there  
(Yah Mo B there)  
Yah Mo B there
