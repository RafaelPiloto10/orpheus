Old december's  
Here at last  
Time  
For celebration  
Christmas present  
Christmas past  
Tumble down  
Together  
Like the snow  
What a show  
  
Now the snowman  
Someone made  
Is melting  
By the road side  
On the wind  
A serenade  
Children's voices  
Singing I believe  
I believe in us  
I believe  
  
Chorus:  
On Christmas morning  
You awaken  
Wwith a smile  
You hold me  
In your arms  
We watch  
The snowflakes fly  
And then you love me  
And I realize  
How sweet love can be  
All the memories  
Coming back again  
Each year  
On Christmas morning  
  
Sentimental melodies  
Surround me  
Like an old friend  
She spent the winter  
Here with me  
Silently we watched  
The season change  
And they change  
So fast  
And fade away
