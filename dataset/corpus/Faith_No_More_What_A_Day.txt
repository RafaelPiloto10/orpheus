A piece of mail  
A letterhead  
A piece of hair  
From a human head  
  
They're stayin' to me  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it before"  
  
You're right, you're right  
"Kill the body and the head will die"  
They're laughin' at me  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it before"  
  
What a day, what a day  
If you can look it in the face  
And hold your vomit  
  
A wet sneeze and a "no left turn"  
A row of teeth and an encouraging word  
Beneath a mile of skin  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it before"  
  
What a day  
What a day  
What a day  
Don't you touch it
