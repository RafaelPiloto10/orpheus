Everybody gonna paid a lot  
To get any kind of weather, 'cause everybody's okay  
Everybody gonna kick back together  
Speak about each other, 'cause everybody's okay  
Some people gonna twist up together  
Help to feel you better, 'cause everybody's okay  
From looking far and wide, I can see you're okay  
When there's people all around, just such a fuss and shade  
And a little bit to food just to see the next day  
'Cause the fields are dried up and the mummy never came  
Can you sing to your Creator, give tobacco to a tree  
Or some flowers to your mother, 'cause she gave you what you need?  
Everybody, can you lay back together  
Star gaze together, 'cause everybody's okay?  
You know your children don't help you feel better  
If your close to each other, 'cause everybody's okay  
From looking far and wide, I can see you're okay  
When there's people all around, just such a fuss and shade  
And a little bit of food just to see the next day  
'Cause the fields are dried up and the mummy never came  
Can you sing to your Creator, give tobacco to tree  
Or some flowers to your mother, 'cause she gave you what you need?  
Everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?  
So everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?  
Everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?  
So everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?  
Said everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?  
Said everybody can you sway to the music  
Let the spirit choose you 'cause everybody's feeling okay?
