There's a time for lies  
And a time for truth  
I say, eye for an eye  
Eye for a tooth  
  
When I roamed young  
I'd scavenge around  
Every nook and cranny  
Of our little town  
It's nice, so nice, to be  
  
Pull out the cannon boys  
Steal us some wine  
Puff Tijuana Smalls  
Shake hands with beef  
  
She's so fine  
She's so sweet  
Mom and Pop they raised her  
On huge slabs of meat  
  
She's fine  
A man of nine  
Water derby day  
Twenty six pumps  
On a Crossman  
And it's time to play  
  
It's nice, so fine, to be  
  
Pull out the cannon boys  
Steal us some wine  
Puff Tijuana Smalls  
Shake hands with beef
