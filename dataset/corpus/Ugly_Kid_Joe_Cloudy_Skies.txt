Well, they keep on taking my heart  
And they keep on taking my soul  
They keep taking an inch when I give them a mile  
And now it seems it's been a while since anyone smiled  
They don't know me  
They don't know me  
But my name is on the highway sign, never look behind  
All those troubles are gone, nothing left but to run  
So meet me down and don't be shy  
A place where we can hide  
There ain't nothing to fear  
There ain't no-one back here  
But you and I and these cloudy skies  
So it's time to leave our home  
And see the faces we've out-grown  
Through the years we've kept our backs to the wind  
So long, farewell, good-bye my friend
