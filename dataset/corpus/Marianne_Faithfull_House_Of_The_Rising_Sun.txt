[Repeat: x2]  
There is a house in New Orleans,  
They call it the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin  
Of many poor girl,  
And me, oh god, I'm one.  
  
If I had listened  
To what my mother said  
I'd've been at home today.  
But I was young and foolish, oh god,  
Let a rambler lead me astray.  
  
Go tell my baby sister  
Don't do what I have done.  
Go shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the risin' sun.  
  
Well, I'm going back to New Orleans,  
My race is almost run.  
I'm going back to spend my life  
In the house of the risin' sun.
