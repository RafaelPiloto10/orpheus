There it was  
Just like old faithful  
The eternal fountain of filthi  
I took a walk straight out of town  
But then I stopped and took my time for pleasure  
I was alone, I looked around  
I heard a voice 50 I buckled for safety  
And there it was down on the ground  
A pool of sound that showed my own reflection  
In a fountain of filth  
Eternal fountain of filth  
I tried to run I couldn't move  
Frozen solid while the thoughts of men  
Attacked me  
Out of my head the fountain shot  
And drowned me in a serum that I couldn't  
Put a stop to  
It was me myself and I locked in a struggle  
With the talking head below me  
In a fountain of filth  
Eternal fountain of filth  
I got a hunger that makes me say things  
I got a hunger that makes me do things  
I got a hunger that makes me want things  
I'm just a victim of filth  
Nowhere are we safe  
From the power of  
From the reach of  
From the appeal of  
The eternal fountain of filth
