Time keeps movin' on,  
Friends they turn away.  
I keep movin' on  
But I never found out why  
I keep pushing so hard the dream,  
I keep tryin' to make it right  
Through another lonely day, whoaa.  
Dawn has come at last,  
Twenty-five years, honey just in one night, oh yeah.  
Well, I'm twenty-five years older now  
So I know we can't be right  
And I'm no better, baby,  
And I can't help you no more  
Than I did when just a girl.  
Aww, but it don't make no difference, baby, no, no,  
And I know that I could always try.  
It don't make no difference, baby, yeah,  
I better hold it now,  
I better need it, yeah,  
I better use it till the day I die, whoa.  
Don't expect any answers, dear,  
For I know that they don't come with age, no, no.  
Well, ain't never gonna love you any better, babe.  
And I'm never gonna love you right,  
So you'd better take it now, right now.  
Oh! But it don't make no difference, babe, hey,  
And I know that I could always try.  
There's a fire inside everyone of us,  
You'd better need it now,  
I got to hold it, yeah,  
I better use it till the day I die.  
Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no,  
And it never ever will, hey,  
I wanna talk about a little bit of loving, yeah,  
I got to hold it, baby,  
I'm gonna need it now,  
I'm gonna use it, say, aaaah,  
Don't make no difference, babe, yeah,  
Ah honey, I'd hate to be the one.  
I said you're gonna live your life  
And you're gonna love your life  
Or babe, someday you're gonna have to cry.  
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed,  
Ah, baby, yes indeed.  
I said you, you're always gonna hurt me,  
I said you're always gonna let me down,  
I said everywhere, every day, every day  
And every way, every way.  
Ah honey won't you hold on to what's gonna move.  
I said it's gonna disappear when you turn your back.  
I said you know it ain't gonna be there  
When you wanna reach out and grab on.  
Whoa babe,  
Whoa babe,  
Whoa babe,  
Oh but keep truckin' on.  
Whoa yeah,  
Whoa yeah,  
Whoa yeah,  
Whoa,  
Whoa,  
Whoa,  
Whoa,  
Whoa ...
