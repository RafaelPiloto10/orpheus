Puppets in the dance are we  
Or do we call the tune  
We're keeping up our ratings  
While we feed you wreck and ruin  
Thespians of revolution, money in the bank  
With our college boy lisps  
  
Brown ale gurus Sunday supplement priests  
Lunch with urban guerrillas  
On expense account receipts  
Opinionated interviews  
From an informed source  
can't tell you no names  
secret of course  
  
We are the people  
I am you, you are me  
We are the people, I am you, you are me  
Any fool can see all the people  
We are the people  
  
We're on the side of politicians  
Misquote their lies  
Building up those favors  
We collect on bye and bye  
On the side of winners  
We can change with the fees  
Give us your proposition  
We're only here to please  
  
We are the people  
I am you, you are me  
We are the people  
I am you, you are me  
Any fool can see all the people  
We are the people  
  
Oh, please defend me  
Don't ask for my surrender  
We are the kings, you're the pretenders  
You walk and I'll talk  
Stop ringing my doorbell with questions  
  
Subscribe, view us, listen to us  
We've got the plan  
We've got all the answers  
And we've got your man  
We can change the format  
If the sales go down  
And we got girls for everyone  
Yellow, pink or brown  
  
We are the people  
  
We are the people  
I am you, you are me  
We are the people  
I am you, you are me  
Any fool can see all the people  
We are the people
