I see your face at the movies  
I hear your voice on the radio  
You're makin' love on the silver screen  
I want you more, I know  
Temptation...Infatuation...  
Suzanne, don't walk away  
On no Suzanne, oh girl I'm callin' you  
Suzanne, so far away  
Remember Suzanne, those summer nights with me  
  
I wonder if you're really happy  
And if you saw me, would you know my name  
I'm the one you used to hold on to  
You're the one who used to wear my ring  
Remember...our last September...  
  
Oh Suzanne, don't walk away  
On no Suzanne, oh girl I'm callin' you  
Suzanne, so far away  
Remember Suzanne, those summer nights with me  
  
Remember...our last September...  
Suzanne, so far away  
Remember Suzanne, those summer nights with me  
  
Suzanne, don't walk away, I love you Suzanne  
I'm still callin' you  
Suzanne...no no no no no remember  
Those summer nights with me, those summer nights
