See you right around the corner  
I know that you were getting closer  
It dawned on me, it dawned on me  
That you could be the one for me  
But I'm sure you've heard it all the time  
I just look like the other guy  
Next to me, next to me  
Next to me, next to me  
  
Let's go home together  
You'll say that it's good for me  
You're good for me  
But it's all in my head  
When I wake in my bed  
Don't know  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(In this life, in this life, in this life)  
  
And I know you're not  
One of those girls  
Who takes her time  
She'll come for me, she'll come for me  
She'll come for me  
And I can wait for eternity  
For you to take your turn with me  
Turn with me, turn with me  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(In this life, in this life, in this life)  
  
Baby, it's fine  
If you want to be mine  
Just call out my name  
Don't wait in line  
Just take my hand  
And break my heart tonight  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(This life, this life, this life)  
  
Take me home with you  
I can't go alone  
And take me home tonight
