In the midst of all my darkness, baby  
You came along to guide me  
You took pity on a lonely girl  
When you said you'd stand beside me  
I'll never forget you for what you've done  
I'll never turn my back on you for anyone  
  
I got so much love to give you  
Baby, I got so much love to give you  
Oh, there's more than enough  
To last a whole life through, yes  
And it's all for you  
  
My world was cold and so empty  
And my life so unfulfilling  
When I needed someone to pick me up  
You were oh-so willing  
Now to you it might seem a little thing  
But to me it seemed you'd changed my winter to spring  
  
(I've got so much love)  
Baby, I got so much love to give you  
Oh, there's more than enough  
To last my whole life through, yeah  
It's all for you  
  
There's so few men nowadays  
Who understand the soul of a woman  
Now they're always on the take, and they're  
Never giving, never offering a helping hand  
Oh baby, I can count on you  
Whenever trouble calls  
You see me through  
You show your love in so many ways  
I'm gonna love you for the rest of my days, yeah  
  
I got so much love to give you  
Baby, I got so much love to give you  
Oh, there's more than enough  
To last my whole life through, oh yeah  
It's all for you  
  
(So much love)  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
(So much love)  
Yes it is  
Just say it, baby, baby, baby  
So many days  
So many ways
