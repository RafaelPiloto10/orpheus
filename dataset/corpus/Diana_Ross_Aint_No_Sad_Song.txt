Baby, the love we used to share  
Has faded day by day  
And now you want to leave me  
So you're lookin' for away  
And if you see a tear in my eye  
It's not for you I cry  
  
Don't you know I tried to make our love  
Like every love should be  
You say it ain't enough  
So you're walking out on me  
But if you can't find just what you want  
Don't you come runnin' back to me  
  
Baby, I know you think I'm at home  
Cryin' the blues  
But remember darlin'  
Somebody else will want what you couldn't use  
Oh, yeah, what you couldn't use  
  
Ain't no sad song  
Since you've been gone  
Ain't no sad song  
Since you've been gone  
You made me so very, very happy boy  
But if you don't want to be mine  
  
Hey, when will I stop lovin' you  
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know  
All my friends give me advice  
They say hang on, girl  
Ooh, but I want him  
Hang on girl  
I don't need him  
  
The clock didn't stop ticking  
'Cause you let me be  
Time will let nobody  
Take your love from me  
  
You made me so very, very happy boy  
But if you don't want to be mine  
I know you want to be  
With someone for yourself  
But I know you don't want me  
To be with no one else  
  
Ain't no sad song  
Since you've been gone  
Ain't no sad song  
Since you've been gone  
Ain't no sad song  
Since you've been gone
