Red ribbons hanging up  
Tennessee Square  
Old people laughing and singing  
And dancing down there  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
Ferris wheel lights look like pictures  
I'd seen in a book somewhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
It's difficult to go on  
Knowing you're out there somwhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere
