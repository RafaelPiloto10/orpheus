While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,  
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.  
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,  
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer:  
  
God bless America, land that I love,  
Stand beside her and guide her  
Through the night with a light from above.  
From the mountains, to the prairies,  
To the oceans white with foam,  
God bless America,  
My home sweet home.
