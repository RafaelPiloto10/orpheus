What if there was no lie  
Nothing wrong, nothing right  
What if there was no time  
And no reason, or rhyme  
What if you should decide  
That you don't want me there by your side  
That you don't want me there in your life  
  
What if I got it wrong  
And no poem or song  
Could put right what I got wrong  
Or make you feel I belong  
  
What if you should decide  
That you don't want me there by your side  
That you don't want me there in you life  
  
Oooooooh that's right  
Lets take a breath try to put it aside  
Ooooooh that's right  
How can you know it if you don't even try  
Ooooooh that's right  
  
Every step that you take  
Could be your biggest mistake  
It could bend or it could break  
That's the risk that you take  
  
What if you should decide  
That you don't want me there in your life  
That you don't want me there by your side  
  
Oooooooh that's right  
Lets take a breath try to put it aside  
Ooooooh that's right  
How can you know when you don't even try  
Ooooooh that's right
