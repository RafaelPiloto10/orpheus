I'm ready to go,  
It's creeping along.  
A deep lack of guilt,  
And fool's sense of love.  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
Greased and unclean,  
A hiss laid by God.  
A duped bridle hole,  
And a boyhood slipping in Blood.  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
V you L T you are E - P I A N O!!  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.
