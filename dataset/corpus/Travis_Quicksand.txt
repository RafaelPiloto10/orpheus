Take me away take me away  
You said that you were gonna stay  
But you're always lying anyway  
You're gonna suffer if you don't start breathing  
  
Now  
Now that I need you  
You're going away  
Everyday sinking in the quicksand  
Follow me down the drain  
  
But it doesn't matter anyway  
You're gonna get yours any day  
And why you put the blame on me  
If you could only see yourself as others see you  
  
Now that I need you  
You're going insane  
Everyday sinking in the quick sand  
Follow me down the drain  
Everyday drinking in the same bar  
Drowning my sorrows away  
  
Take me away take me away  
Or I'm never gonna get away  
But it makes no difference to me  
It's just the sound of on more rock star bleeding  
  
Now  
Now that I need you  
You're out of the frame  
Day by day sinking in the quicksand  
Follow me down the drain  
Everyday drinking in the same bar  
Make mine the same again
