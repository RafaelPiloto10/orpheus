Walkin' around  
Out of a town  
Walkin' it out  
When you want to  
Soldiering my style is smiling  
Turn it into whatever I've chosen  
Take me now to the water  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
Kick it around  
Stare at the ground  
Breakin' it down  
When you want to  
Soldiering my days I've chosen  
Dancing round do whatever I want to  
Take me now it's the water  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
I think I know, everything you gonna say  
I think you know, don't want to runaway  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway
