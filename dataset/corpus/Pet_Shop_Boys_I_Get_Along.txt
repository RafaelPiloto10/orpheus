Feeling like I'm stuck in a hole  
Body and soul  
While you're out of control  
Now I know why you had to go  
Well I think we both know  
Why it had to be so  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you  
  
[Chorus]  
I get along, get along  
Without you very well  
I get along very well  
  
Now I know you'd much rather be  
With rock royalty  
Instead of someone like me  
The big boys are back and we need them, you said  
Think it was something you'd read  
And it stuck in your head  
Even though I don't suppose  
That's as far as it goes  
You've go quite an appetite  
For being wronged and in the right  
Well from now on it won't affect me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The morning after the night before  
I'd been alerted  
To your lies  
I phoned you up  
Your calls were all diverted  
Took a long time to track you down  
Even then you were defiant  
It's not what you think it is, you said  
And proceeded to deny it  
  
So I lost my patience at last  
And it happened so fast  
You belong in the past  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you  
  
[Chorus]
