I see trees that are green, red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
I see skies of blue, and clouds of white  
The bright blessed day, dark sacred night  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of the people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"  
But they're really saying, "I love you"  
  
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow  
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
Oh yeah
