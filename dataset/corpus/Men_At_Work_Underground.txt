Don't take the fire from your eyes  
Must make them feel the heat  
They build castles underground for the rich and politic elite  
  
Keep all the home fires burning,  
Don't let the lights go out  
The streets are empty, and there's nobody about.  
  
We'll be alright in the morning time  
Yeah  
We're doing fine, I'll see you on the night line  
  
There's no need for you to fight, boys,  
Hang up all your guns  
Find your mask and asbestos you can, get ready to run  
  
Keep all the food lines moving,  
Don't come cry'n' for more  
The signs were there, you should have bought connections before  
  
We'll be alright in the morning time  
Yeah  
We're doing fine, I'll see you on the night line  
  
It's such a big joke  
It's the talk of the town  
All the planets to whom I spoke  
Are trying their best to play it down  
  
Don't take the fire from your eyes  
Must make them feel the heat  
But my head's unsteady  
I can't seem to keep my feet  
  
Jump off the Eiffel Tower  
Just have a look around  
Move fast, in the tunnels of the underground  
Move fast, in the tunnels of the underground  
  
Let's go!
