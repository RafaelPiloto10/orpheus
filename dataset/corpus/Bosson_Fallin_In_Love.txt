My doctor says I need no cure this  
Time That everything's alright and I  
Am fine but my friends don't agree  
They say I'm not the one I used to  
Be And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder Why I'm smiling all the time  
The only thing I have inside my mind  
Is a picture of you And it's there no  
Matter what I do No matter what I  
Do not know...  
  
I don't know what it is but I think I'm  
Falling in love I don't know what it is  
But when I close my eyes You're the  
One I'm dreaming of I don't know  
What it is but I'm floating in the sky  
I don't know what it is and I sure  
Don't know how But you filled  
My heart with butterflies I'm falling in  
Love...  
  
Seems like all my problems went  
Away I start to make the most of  
Everyday So I spend them with you  
No one makes me feel the way you  
Do And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder about the pain I get inside  
Everytime you're not by my side  
You have opened a door  
I have never felt this way before  
And I want more I don't know....  
  
I don't know what it is....  
  
When we are walking I get to hold  
Your hand And that is making me  
Proud, I'm screaming out loud  
I, I am a happy man  
  
And when we are looking up on a  
Clear blue shy You give me a kiss, I  
Wonder who is THIS LUCKY GUY...
