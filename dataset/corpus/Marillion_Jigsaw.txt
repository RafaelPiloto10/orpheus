We are jigsaw pieces aligned on the perimeter edge,  
Intelocked through a missing piece.  
We are Renaissance children becalmed beneath the bridge of sighs,  
Forever throwing firebrands at the stonework.  
  
We are Siamese children related by the heart,  
Bleeding from the surgery of initial confrontation,  
Holding the word scalpels on trembling lips.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
This is the ricochet...  
  
Drowning Tequila sunsets, stowaways on midnight ships,  
Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.  
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,  
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.  
  
We are pilots of passion sweating the flight on course  
To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,  
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
This is the ricochet...  
  
Are we trigger happy, happy, happy?  
Russian roulette in the waiting room,  
Empty chambers embracing the end.  
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,  
  
Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.  
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,  
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,  
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
And the problems always seem to be,  
We're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
  
This is the ricochet,  
I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,  
Will you show me the pieces next time on the ricochet, (ricochet)  
I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,  
  
There's a problem, there's a ricochet, (ricochet)
