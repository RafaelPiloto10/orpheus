Hamlet fishin' in the grave  
Thru custard bones and stuff  
He aint got no friend in there  
I believe our man's in love  
Hamlet's got a gun-now  
He wears a crucifex  
Pow pow pow pow  
Hamlet moves so beautiful  
Walking thru the flowers  
Who are hing 'round the corners  
He's movin' down the street-now  
He likes the look of that cadillac  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love some kinda love  
Now he movin' down my street  
And he's coming to my house  
Crawling up my stairs  
Where for art thou baby-face  
Where-for-art-thou  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love  
Pow!  
He shoot it inside  
Don't let'em steal your heart away  
He went and stole my heart  
Pow!!  
Hey hey hey  
Pow!!
