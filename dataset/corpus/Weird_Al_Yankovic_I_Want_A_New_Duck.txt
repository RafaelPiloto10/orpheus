Whoa oh  
  
I want a new duck  
One that won't try to bite  
One that won't chew a hole in my socks  
One that won't quack all night  
  
I want a new duck  
One with big webbed feet  
One that knows how to wash my car  
And keep his room real neat  
  
One that won't raid the ice box  
One that'll stay in shape  
One that's never gonna try to migrate or escape  
Or I'll tie him up with duck tape  
  
I want a new duck  
A mallard I think  
One that won't make a mess of my house  
Or build a nest in the bathroom sink  
  
I want a new duck  
One that won't steal my beer  
One that won't stick his bill in my mail  
One that knows the duck stops here  
  
One that won't drive me crazy waddling all around  
One who'll teach me how to swim and help me not to drown  
And show me how to get down  
How to get down baby  
  
Get it?  
  
I want a new duck  
Not a swan or a goose  
Just a drake I can dress real cute  
Think I'm gonna name him Bruce  
  
I want a new duck  
Not a quail or an owl  
One that won't molt to much  
One that won't smell too fowl  
  
One that won't beg for breadcrumbs  
Hangin' around all day  
He'd better mind his manners  
Better do just what I say  
Or he's gonna be duck patte, duck patte, yah, yah
