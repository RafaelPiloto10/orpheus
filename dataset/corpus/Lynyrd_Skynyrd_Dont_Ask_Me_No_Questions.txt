Well, every time that I come home  
Nobody wants to let me be  
It seems that all the friends I've got  
Just got to come interrogate me  
I appreciate your feelings  
And I don't want to pass you by  
But I don't ask you 'bout your business  
Don't ask me about mine  
  
Well it's true I love the money  
And I love my brand new car  
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey  
And playin' in a honk-tonk bar  
But when I come off the road  
I just gotta have my time  
'Cause I got to find a break in this action  
Or else I'm gonna lose my mind  
  
So don't ask me no questions  
And I won't tell you no lies  
So don't ask me 'bout my business  
And I won't tell you goodbye  
  
Well, what's your favorite color  
And do you dig the brothers, is drivin' me up a wall  
And every time I think I can sleep  
Some fool has got to call  
Well, don't you think that when I come home  
I just want a little piece of mind?  
If you want to talk about the business  
Buddy you're just wasting time  
  
So don't ask me no questions  
And I won't tell you no lies  
So don't ask me 'bout my business  
And I won't tell you goodbye  
  
I said don't ask no stupid questions  
And I won't send you away  
If you want to talk fishin'  
Well, I guess that'll be OK
