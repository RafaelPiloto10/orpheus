If I were your woman and you were my man,  
you'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb.  
If you had the strength to walk out that door,  
My love would over rule my sense, and I'd call you back for more,  
If I were your woman.  
If I were your woman, and you were my man. Um baby.  
  
She tears you down darlin', says you're nothing at all.  
But, I'll pick you up darling, when she lets you fall.  
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass.  
Yet you beg her to love you, but, me you don't ask.  
If I were your woman, If I were your woman.  
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do,  
I'd never, no, no, stop loving you.  
Yeah, yeah, um  
  
Life is so crazy, a love is unkind.  
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?  
You're a part of me, and you don't even know it.  
I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it.  
If I were your woman, If I were your woman,  
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.  
Never, no, no, no, stop loving you, ah, yeah.  
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.  
Never, never stop loving you if
