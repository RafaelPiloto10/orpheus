For all I've been blessed with in this life,  
There was an emptiness in me.  
I was imprisoned by the power of gold.  
With one kind touch you sent me free.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
  
For every mountain I have climbed,  
Every raging river crossed,  
You were the treasure that I longed to find.  
Without your love I would be lost.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
  
I know that I won't live forever,  
But forever I'll be loving you.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
In this life I was loved by you.
