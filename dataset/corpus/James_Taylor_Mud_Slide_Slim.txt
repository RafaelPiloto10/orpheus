Mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
Oh, mud slide, i'm dependent on you  
I don't know but i've been told  
There's a time from time to time  
I can't eat, i can't sleep  
But i just might move my feet  
'cause there's nothing like  
The sound of sweet soul music  
To change a young lady's mind  
And there's nothing like a  
Walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind  
Mud slide i'm depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
  
I've been letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
Yes, i'm letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
  
I'm gonna cash in my hand and  
Pick up on a piece of land  
And build myself a cabin back in the woods  
Lord, it's there i'm gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts to changing for the good  
Now the reason i'm smiling is over on a island  
On a hillside in the woods where i belong  
I want to thank jimmy, jimmy, john, nick and laurie  
The no jets construction for setting  
Me down a homestead on the farm  
  
Mud slide, i'm depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon
