When I was a young boy,  
Said put away those young boy ways  
Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older  
I love all those young boy days.  
With a girl like you,  
With a girl like you,  
Lord knows there are things we can do, baby,  
Just me and you.  
Come on and make it hurt  
  
CHORUS:  
Hurt so good.  
Come on baby, make it hurt so good.  
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.  
You make it hurt so good.  
  
Don't have to be so exciting.  
Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah.  
You always look so invitin'  
You ain't as green as you are young  
Hey baby, its you.  
Come on, girl, now, its you.  
Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby.  
Let's see what we can do.  
Come on and make it hurt  
  
Chorus  
  
I ain't talkin' no big deals  
I ain't made no plans myself.  
I ain't talkin' no high heels  
Maybe we could walk around all day long,  
Walk around all day long.  
Uh!  
  
Chorus twice  
  
Hey, hey
