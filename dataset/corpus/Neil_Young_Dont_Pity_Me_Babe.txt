Young Pegi just died today  
Young Pegi just died today  
And I guess  
Nobody even knows the case  
But the way the story goes  
She just ran out of clothes  
No will this world  
Just for the peg down  
Last words, can't talk  
And then she wrote.  
  
Some people can't stand no rain  
Some people can't stand no rain  
When it's cloudy outside  
You can't see the sun  
But on a bright and sunny day  
The people all go away  
Except one  
Oh no don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Don't see no tears around me  
Don't see no tears around me  
I don't take too much stock  
In the things people say  
I'm not saying that they're wrong  
They've just  
Been standing around too long  
Gone bad,  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Can't ride my broom no more  
Can't ride my broom no more  
'Cause the landlady's taken  
To sweeping the floor  
I guess I'll go back to my place  
And occupy a little space  
John Doe,  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
The streets are crammed, can't walk  
Might find somebody and talk  
I can't find nobody who  
Say boo, guess who  
'Cause that street  
Is paved with aires  
And everybody is putting on theirs  
Can't breathe  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
He's standing outside my door  
He's standing outside my door  
But he won't ring the bell  
And he's just to scared to knock  
And he's puzzled  
And he's young  
And he's doing what's  
Already been done  
One more  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright.
