Is it alive, does it writhe  
Can it survive under the sun?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Is it green, is it red  
  
Is it alive or is it dead  
I can't put my finger on it  
Scathe with a lathe  
All the days in the past  
  
I can't put my finger on it  
Is it brown, is it white  
Is it really outta sight  
I can't put my finger on it  
  
Can it squeal, does it squirm  
If it's fresh will it burn?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Can it fly, will it try  
  
If the wings are still wet?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Can it heal, is it real  
Can it feel the threads of time?  
  
I can't put my finger on it  
Does it glow, will it shine  
Does it leave a trail of slime  
I can't put my finger on it  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?
