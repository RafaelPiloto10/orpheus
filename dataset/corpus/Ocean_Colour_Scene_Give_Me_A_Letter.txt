Give me a letter  
The sooner the better  
I'm out of here  
  
Give me a card  
I'm not waiting hard  
To hear you  
  
All I'm trying to do  
Is all you want to say  
  
Give me a letter  
The sooner the better  
I'm away from you  
  
Trying so hard  
I'm not taking a car  
And I'll lose you  
  
All I want to do  
Is all I'm trying to say  
  
What I'm trying to say  
Is what I'm trying to do  
  
Repeat first two verses  
What I'm trying to say  
What I'm trying to do  
Is keeping up with you
