If a ship of dreams bid me come, would I board it?  
If I had their gold in my hands, would I hoard it?  
If I knew the trials I must face, would I carry on at all?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring me comfort--Lord help us to survive  
If his pretty eyes shone my way, would I leave you?  
  
If I wasn't sure he would stay, would I deceive you?  
If I had to melt you with promises, would they stand or fall?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfort--Lord help us to survive  
If time should call me a fool, would I laugh or would I care?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfort--Lord help us to survive
