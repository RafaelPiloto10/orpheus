The wise man said just walk this way  
To the dawn of the light  
The wind will blow into your face  
As the years pass you by  
Hear this voice from deep inside  
It's the call of your heart  
Close your eyes and you will find  
The passage out of the dark  
  
Here I am  
Will you send me an angel  
Here I am  
In the land of the morning star  
  
The wise man said just find your place  
In the eye of the storm  
Seek the roses along the way  
Just beware of the thorns  
  
Here I am  
Will you send me an angel  
Here I am  
In the land of the morning star  
  
The wise man said just raise your hand  
And reach out for the spell  
Find the door to the promised land  
Just believe in yourself  
Hear this voice from deep inside  
It's the call of your heart  
Close your eyes and you will find  
The way out of the dark  
  
Here I am  
Will you send me an angel  
Here I am  
In the land of the morning star  
Here I am  
Will you send me an angel  
Here I am  
In the land of the morning star
