[Verse 1]  
Feel no pain, but my life isn't easy  
I know I'm my best friend  
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger  
I'll fight until the end  
To escape from the true false world  
Undamaged destiny  
Can't get caught in the endless circle  
Ring of stupidity  
  
[Chorus]  
Out for my own, out to be free  
One with my mind, they just can't see  
No need to hear things that they say  
Life is for my own to live my own way  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings  
Don't tell me what to do  
I don't care now, because I'm on my side  
And I can see through you  
Feed my brain with your so called standards  
Who says that I am not right  
Break away from your common fashion  
See through your blurry sight  
  
[Chorus]  
Out for my own, out to be free  
One with my mind, they just can't see  
No need to hear things that they say  
Life is for my own to live my own way  
  
[Outro]  
See them try to bring the hammer down  
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
