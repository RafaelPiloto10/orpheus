A man can only last so long.  
Before temptation gets too strong.  
But I'm doin' all I know to do.  
To try and stay away from you.  
You got me right on the Borderline.  
  
[Chorus]  
Borderline.  
Don't let me cross over.  
She's right behind me in the moonlight.  
Lord knows I've tried to think of my lover.  
Borderline.  
Don't let me cross her tonight.  
  
You know I got a woman at home.  
That I sure hate to leave alone.  
But still you just keep comin' on like I'm not made of flesh and bone.  
You got me right on the Borderline.  
  
Promises are easy made.  
In the heat of passion, light of day.  
But let that daylight start to fade and your best laid plans might get mis-
layed.  
When you're right on the Borderline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Borderline. Don't let me cross her tonight.
