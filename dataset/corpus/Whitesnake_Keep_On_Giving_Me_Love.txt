Oh, you told me you were burned by holy water,  
And the priest forgot the words  
He was trying to say.  
It seems your best friend  
Is your own reflection,  
And no promise of love  
Is gonna make you want to stay.  
  
I don't mind,  
You can think it over slow,  
And tell me what you find.  
I'm marking time,  
If you got love to give,  
Baby, I don't mind.  
  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me love.  
  
You got fox eyes,  
They burn like a sunrise,  
You got a walk that makes a mans' blood turn to wine.  
You bought and sold me  
For you lover,  
As long as you feed me good, baby, I don't mind.  
  
I don't mind,  
You can think it over slow,  
And tell me what you find.  
I'm marking time,  
If you got love to give,  
Baby, I don't mind.  
  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me love.  
  
So you told me you were burned by holy water,  
And the priest forgot the words  
He was trying to say.  
It seems your best friend  
Is your own reflection,  
And no promise of love  
Is gonna make you want to stay.  
  
I don't mind,  
You can think it over slow,  
And tell me what you find.  
I'm marking time,  
If you got love to give,  
Baby, I don't mind.  
  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me love.
