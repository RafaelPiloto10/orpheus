Remember me the one who heard your cries  
And reached out and dried your eyes  
  
Remember me the one who found you and wrapped all my love around you  
When you were all alone and all your dreams were gone  
When you were nothing but a tear stained face I took you in  
Know your broken wing has mended and your need for me has ended  
Know you say you must be free  
You wanna fly away from me  
You were lost in yesterday I gave you my tomorrow  
Know your leaving me in sorrow and you telling me: "im sorry" but baby  
  
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true  
  
Out of sympathy and all you feel for me  
After all the sweet love I've given you (given you baby)  
Girl you walk away with the best of me  
The love I gave to you, you given to someone new  
And sorry won't ease this misery  
  
Remember me who took the hand, held it up to make a stand  
Remember me the one who's love has shared, with one who really cares  
  
Now you've turned away from me and say that you sorry  
That it had to be baby sorry it had to be that way  
  
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true
