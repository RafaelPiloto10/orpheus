Love is all around, I want you to see it from here  
Love is just a sound, I want you to hear it from here  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
But it's all around us just the same  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
You don't know that I don't know your name  
  
Love is all around, I want you to live it from here  
Love is just a sound, I want to sing it for here  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
But it's all around us just the same  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
You don't know that I don't know your name  
  
Peace is all around, I want you to need it from here  
Peace is just a sound, I want you to hear it from fear  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
But it's all around us just the same  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
You don't know that I don't know your name
