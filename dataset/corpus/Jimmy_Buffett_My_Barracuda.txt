Well I saw this couple  
Just the other day  
Livin' under a bridge  
In a homeless way  
  
Like a million others  
All over this land  
Livin' day to day  
Without a master plan  
  
In this unforgiving world  
There ain't no doubt  
It will chew you up  
And it will spit you out  
She calls him barracuda  
My barracuda  
  
She used to work in the circus  
A real high wire act  
He was a lion tamer  
Up until the attack  
  
He came without instructions  
Then he came unglued  
Now he's just a monster  
in a human suit  
She calls him barracuda  
My barracuda  
  
She still can't figure out  
What she's doin' down here  
Ans she don't know  
If he loves her or not  
  
He may be a barracuda  
But he's the only lover she's got  
Barracuda
