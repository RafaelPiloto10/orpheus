Now you know that I heart everything about you  
And that's why it's quite hard to get through this alone  
  
You're the only one I can talk to about it  
In my darkest night I will be on my own  
  
These walls that we climb are hard to recognize  
They fall when I say your name  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair  
  
Don't you know it's hard, quite, in the time of confusion  
To tell you that I love you  
  
You see it could have been me instead of you  
It could have been me if I wanted to  
But it wasn't  
So we'll have to face the truth  
  
These walls that we climb are hard to recognize  
They fall when I say your name  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair  
  
Time to pull the shutters down  
Breakin' clouds don't make a sound?  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair
