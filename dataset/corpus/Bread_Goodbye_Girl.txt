  
All your life you've waited  
For love to come and stay  
And now that I have found you,  
You must not, slip away  
I know it's hard believin'  
The words you've heard before  
But darlin' you must trust them just once more,  
  
'Cause baby goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
If you wake up and I'm not there,  
I won't be long away  
'Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl  
Will bring me back to you.  
  
I know you've been taken,  
Afraid to hurt again  
You fight the love you feel for me  
Instead, givin' in  
But I can wait forever,  
A-helpin' you to see  
That I was meant for you and you for me  
  
So remember goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
Though we may be so far apart,  
You still will have my heart  
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl  
'Cause now you're home at last.
