Crazy  
I'm crazy for feelin' so lonely  
I'm crazy  
Crazy for feelin' so blue  
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then someday  
You'd leave me for somebody new  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin' what in the world did I do?  
  
I'm crazy  
For thinkin' that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for cryin'  
And crazy for tryin'  
And I'm crazy for lovin' you  
  
Crazy  
For thinkin' that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for cryin'  
And crazy for tryin'  
And I'm crazy for lovin' you
