There's a hundred dollar bill on the table  
To get me through the night  
Got a tight blue jean honky tonk queen  
To hold me tight and the cowboy bands in mission  
Of Texas waltz  
It's music to my ears and a need to hear  
To keep me from climbing the wall  
  
Cause tonight I'll be honky tonk crazy  
Rip roaring wild, one more time  
Tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy  
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind  
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind  
  
Got all my friends around me  
Telling the latest jokes  
They can't see the joke's on me  
I'm at the end of my rope  
So i step out side and drink one  
In the driving rain  
That's all right if i'm high tonight  
Cause she's already drove me insane.  
  
Cause tonight I'll be honky tonk crazy  
Rip roaring wild, one more time  
Tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy  
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind  
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind  
Oh, let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
