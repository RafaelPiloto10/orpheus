Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looks like you got the best of me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that you're gone  
  
Mocking Bird high in a loof  
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that you're gone.  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me  
Mocking Bird high in a loof  
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof.  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that you're gone.  
  
Throwed some papers, tried to scare him away  
Just looked down at me and this is what he said  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looks like you got the best of me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that you're gone
