It's just a little bitty pissant country place  
Ain't nothin' much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place  
Ain't nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But there's nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on  
We get simple farmers, local business men  
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin  
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high  
But pay day would get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry  
  
Chorus:  
  
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty
going on  
  
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball  
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all  
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day  
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat  
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street  
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools  
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules  
  
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules  
  
Ruby, Ray start em!  
  
Beds are not to be wallowed in  
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do  
  
And it don't make money!  
Betrix!  
  
I won't tolerate no tying my telephone with other peoples business  
  
Eloise honey!  
  
And please don't show us no tattoos  
No hearts and flowers on your thigh  
  
It's downright tacky  
  
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's  
  
Do you catch my drift?  
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities  
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities  
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
Dawn!  
  
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now  
  
Tatty Joe!  
  
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow  
  
Lindy Lue!  
  
Any one taking sick leave for to make real sure their sick  
  
And every time you hear that bell...  
You better get here double quick  
  
And as for pimps  
Pimps are something you don't need  
To get your daily business done  
Are you listening good?  
Keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes  
And I know how to use a gun  
And nobody messes with my girls  
  
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place  
Don't grip and whine behind my back  
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all  
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that way  
  
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities  
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities  
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But there's nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on
