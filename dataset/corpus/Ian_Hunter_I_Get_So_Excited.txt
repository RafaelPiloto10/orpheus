I hear a thousand drums a million miles away  
I feel the Wembley rock I get a buzz off a big parade  
I get the music  
Everywhere  
Get off on the music  
If this is the end there I don't care  
I get so excited  
So excited  
Call me a fan that's just what I am  
I said I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
My nerves are alive  
I feel like a knife  
I said I get so excited  
  
I hear a choir singing way up above the sea  
I feel the sound a-changing as the night rocks a spell on me  
I get the music  
Everywhere  
Get off on the music  
If this is the end there I don't care I get  
So excited  
So excited  
I'll throw you a line come far behind  
I said I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Its happening so fast  
And the drummers a blast  
I said I get so excited  
By your mind oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your warmth oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your body oh yeah oh yeah  
Excited by your  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah right! I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Band on the run just for the fun  
I said I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
It lasts and it lasts  
Get up off your past  
I said I I I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
Call me a fan that's just what I am  
I said I I I I I I I get  
So excited  
So excited  
My nerves are alive  
I feel like a knife  
I said I I I I
