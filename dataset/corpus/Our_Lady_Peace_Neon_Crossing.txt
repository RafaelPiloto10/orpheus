All you people can feel it waiting  
Innocence and love, wrapped in the arms of the burning neon  
I feel it, I feel it  
It's so entertaining and so wonderful  
It magically calls for you  
Big neon crossing show me the way  
Save my soul today  
Don't you worry and don't be afraid  
Does it send you to the world appealing  
Where there is spoken word that I can't take  
So I'm the liar, I'm the liar  
You'd be so disappointed  
To find out that the magic was not  
Really meant for you
