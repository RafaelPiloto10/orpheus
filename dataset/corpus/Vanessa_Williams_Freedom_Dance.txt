Far away oh freedom  
  
When it's time to get up you're gonna know it  
You gonna get a felling inside, you gotta show it  
You come on relax and put your mind at ease  
And forget all your insecurities  
  
You gotta move, nothing can hold you down  
And let nothing turn your move around  
Just start counting up 2, 3  
Come on people just get free  
  
Get free  
In the midst of trouble love  
Get free  
Gotta find you another one  
Get free  
Freedom  
  
Come on people just get free  
There's a chance if you open up  
Get free  
Freedom dance if you open up  
Get free  
Freedom  
Come on people just  
  
You've been holding back to long  
Now the feeling is much to strong  
Take a look at your other side of your heart  
And begin to tear the rules apart  
  
No your Momma can't help you now  
And your Daddy can't show you how  
You've gotta do it all by yourself  
And if you need it here's a little help  
  
Get free, get free  
In the midst of trouble love  
Get free  
Gotta find you another one
