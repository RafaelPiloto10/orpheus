Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Try and you don't have to be afraid  
To just rely  
On someone to hold away part of you child  
It's all right  
You can get too much to handle by yourself  
If you can't do it alone, I know you will say  
I don't know what's at stake  
Or what it takes  
  
Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Turn around  
And you just might see the good  
You've left behind  
But you're all caught up  
In what's still left to find  
And it's never enough  
So slow down  
And the root of what you're feeling might appear  
When all the pushin' up the hill has brought you here  
And you're used up  
To the line  
If you tell me you are fine  
  
Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)  
To carry you there  
Oh yeah  
  
Say, don't be too proud  
I'm holding my hand out  
You've been my friend on darker days  
See, I'll still be there  
Despite your despair  
And I don't really care what you say  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
[Repeat: x11]  
I will carry you there
