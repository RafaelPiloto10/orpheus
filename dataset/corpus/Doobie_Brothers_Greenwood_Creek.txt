Tom johnston  
Smell the fragrance of the old pine tree  
See the woman, she's down on her knees  
She own some land, and a good crop she seeks  
Down along the banks of greenwood creek  
I can hear that southbound rollin'  
Carryin' all my hopes away  
I'm strapped to my mule at the old country school  
When I'm gonna get out, I can't say  
Played guitar for ten long years  
My only pay was the hound dogs' cheers  
Someday I'm gonna get me some land  
Far away in that promised land  
I can hear that southbound rollin'  
Carryin' all my hopes away  
I'm strapped to my mule at the old country school  
When I'm gonna get out, I can't say
