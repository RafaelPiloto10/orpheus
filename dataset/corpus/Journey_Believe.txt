Hold on, hold on  
To opportunities you thought long gone  
Hold on, hold on  
To the could-have-beens and should-have-dones  
  
You can lose yourself along the way  
Find there's something new in yesterday  
  
Hold onto your faith and your dreams  
Look into yourself and believe  
In you  
  
Oh, go on, go on  
The stars will guide your journey home, yeah  
Oh, it won't be long  
'Til you see your diamonds in the stone, yeah  
  
'Cause there's still some magic here tonight  
If you just step out into the light  
  
Hold onto your faith and your dreams  
Look into yourself and believe  
  
I believe in you, believe in me  
I believe in you, believe in me  
I believe the truth will set you free, yeah  
I believe in you, believe in me  
  
I believe in you, believe in me  
  
(Hold on) Hold on, hold on  
To your innocence and your beliefs  
Mmm, hold on, hold on  
Onto who you are and where you've been  
  
I believe in you, believe in me, yeah  
I believe in you, believe in me  
Oh, I believe the truth will set you free, yeah, yeah  
I believe in you, believe in me  
  
Oh I believe in you, believe in me  
Oh I believe in you, believe in me  
Yeah I believe the truth will set you free  
Oh, I believe in you, believe in me  
Oh, whoa, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
I believe in you (I believe in you)  
Darlin', believe in me (Darlin', believe in me)  
I believe in you (I believe in you)  
Darlin', believe in me (Darlin', believe in me)
