[Chorus]  
Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long  
Just trying to find, my way back home  
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone  
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long  
Just trying to find, my way back home  
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone  
  
Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home  
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on  
You walk by, they get wrong you reply  
Then shit get blown  
Way outta proportion, way past discussion  
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em  
Figure you'll get jumped  
That next, they don't wanna stop  
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance  
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion  
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya  
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound  
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,  
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys  
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you  
Could fuck around, get shot die any day  
Niggas die, every day all over  
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit  
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music  
Or did the ones, with the good sense  
Not use it, usually niggas  
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall  
So they just start shootin'  
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,  
From Bankhead or from your projects  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take time to think,  
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy  
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it  
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen  
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'  
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'  
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'  
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad  
Now think about damn, what a life I had  
Most of that shit, look back just laugh  
Some shit, still look back just sad  
Maybe my homeboy, till be around  
Had I not, hit the nigga  
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war  
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door  
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more  
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more  
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more  
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure  
Now think before I risk my life  
Take them chances to get my stripe  
A nigga put his hands on me alright  
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night  
Cause I hit you, you sue me,  
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take  
Time to think, before I make mistakes  
Just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday  
The heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say  
The old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright  
  
[Chorus]
