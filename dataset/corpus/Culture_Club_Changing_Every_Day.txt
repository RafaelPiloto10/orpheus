Someone says  
Wake up child,  
And throw your life away.  
See you in the crime file,  
What will your mama say?  
  
Sometimes you get angry,  
No focus in your life.  
When people get hungry,  
They learn how to survive.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
  
Summer syncopation,  
The space between your eyes.  
Is a place for heroes,  
That never compromise.  
  
Sometimes you feel lonely,  
No focus or surprise.  
Pushed into production,  
What a way to live our lives.  
  
[Chorus]
