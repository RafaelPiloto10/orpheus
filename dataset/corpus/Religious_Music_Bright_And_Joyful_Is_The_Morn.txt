Bright and joyful is the morn  
For us to a Child is born  
From the highest realms of Heaven  
Unto us a Son is given.  
  
On His shoulders He shall bear  
Power and majesty, and wear  
On His vesture and His thigh  
Names most awful, names most high.  
  
Wonderful in counsel be  
Christ, the incarnate Deity  
Sire of ages, ne'er to cease  
King of kings, and Prince of peace.  
  
Come and worship at His feet  
Yield to Him the homage meet  
From the manger to the throne  
Homage due to God alone...
