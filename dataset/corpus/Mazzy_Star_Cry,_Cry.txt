Cry, cry for you  
Just like you knew I wouldn't do  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like a song in the last light  
  
Should I leave it all away  
Not like the kindness that you gave  
That's why it never seems the same  
Behind your eyes  
  
I stood behind when no one asked me  
And took you home after the fight  
I drove my car into city lights  
Drove down the road that I am on  
  
Cry, cry for you  
That's what you think I want to be  
Cry, cry for you  
An empty heart that sees me through  
  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like you knew I wouldn't do  
Cry cry for you  
Just like a song in the last light  
  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like you knew I wouldn't do
