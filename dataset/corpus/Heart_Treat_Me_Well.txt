Well I have lost some time but I have won  
And if you make it through  
You know you've just begun  
  
The winter cold is coming  
And the fire will soon be burning  
  
So will you treat me well  
Oh, will you treat me well?  
  
And I am asking will you save a place for me  
To rest beside your heart  
And feel I'm free  
Now what good does feeling strong do  
When I am here without you?  
  
So will you treat me well  
Oh well, will you treat me well?
