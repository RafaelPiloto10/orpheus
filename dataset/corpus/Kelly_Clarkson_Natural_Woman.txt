Looking out on the morning rain  
  
I used to feel so uninspired  
  
And when I knew I had to face another day  
  
Lord, it made me feel, made me feel so tired  
  
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind  
  
But you're the key to my peace of mind  
  
  
  
'cause you make me feel  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman  
  
  
  
Oh, baby, what you've done to me  
  
Ooh, you make me feel so good inside  
  
And I just don't want to be close to you  
  
You make me feel so aliive  
  
  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman
