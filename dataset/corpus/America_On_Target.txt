I hear a car, I hope it's yours  
I hear the phone, I hope it's you  
It seems I spend most half my life waiting  
For the things I'll never do  
When you were here, in love with me  
There was so much (so much, so much) I couldn't see  
And I watched you home believing  
That you would never leave  
Now I can't stand to be without you  
I'm burning for one more kiss  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Night after night I lie awake  
Wond'ring how long it's gonna take  
Till I hold you close beside me  
And share the love we make  
'Cause I can't stand to be without you  
I can't take much more of this  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Ah, oh baby turn your heart around  
Ah, (oo) baby turn your heart around  
Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) baby turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) let me turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) baby turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di ...
