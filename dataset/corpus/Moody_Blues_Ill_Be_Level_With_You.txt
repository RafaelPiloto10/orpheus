Little guy, little hands, little eyes and lots of time  
What you gonna be what you gonna see  
When your eyes are level with mine  
  
I'll be level with you  
I don't know what I would do  
If I had to face the things that you've got coming down the line  
  
Lots of luck, lots of health, lots of wealth, little pain  
That's what I want for you but there's little I can do  
To put you on the gravy train  
  
I'll be level with you  
You'll always end up coming through  
But you'll find yourself lost in space now and again  
  
But you have to have a world you can live in  
Not a world where all the hope is gone  
And as long as we are here together  
We must build a home for the free  
  
Filled with pity  
Not pain  
That's loving and sane  
Not divided by hate  
And living in spite  
'Til it's too late  
  
Life is here  
Love will come in the end give it time  
There's wonders still to do and I know you'll find it's true  
That yours will be bigger than mine  
  
I'll be level with you  
The one thing I hope you will do is tell me about what  
You're doing from time to time
