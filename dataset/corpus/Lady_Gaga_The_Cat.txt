I can't help myself  
I'm addicted to a life  
Of fur-retrial  
It's some kind of joke  
I'm obsessively opposed to the  
Canine  
  
All we care about is  
Garbage cans, kitty beds and fishy foods  
Give me something, I wannabe  
Feline, Hollywood, yes we live for the  
  
Cats, doin' it for the cats  
'Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the spoilt and lazy  
Cats, doin' it for the cats  
'Cause we gotta taste for fishy treats  
And endless spoiling  
  
Cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats  
We live for the cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats  
Isn't it a shame, shame baby  
A shame, shame  
In it for the cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats  
  
Cats!
