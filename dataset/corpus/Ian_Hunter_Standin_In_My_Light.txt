Well I finally found you out  
All through your mess of dreams  
You won't make it to the night  
And your standing in my light  
You know you've been bad for me  
You ain't got the weight to hate  
But you ain't no pretty sight  
And your standing in my light  
  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light (yeah)  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Now when your old man beats the drums  
Gotta run run run that's dumb  
A little less ego A little more fight  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Things go bad and the risks get high  
Sweeping dead bodies 'cross an open sky  
You took my pictures from your walls  
Ain't gonna trade with the pain of the New York Dolls  
  
Move over cause your standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause your standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause you standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause you standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Yeah, alright  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
I wish you luck on your very last chance  
Cause I knew you blew it at the song and dance  
You froze my feelings, but that's alright  
And your standing in my light
