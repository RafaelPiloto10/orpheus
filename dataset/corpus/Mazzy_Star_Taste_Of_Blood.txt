Red oh red,  
The taste of blood  
On lips of wine  
Red so silent,  
Wait a minute  
Or just a little while  
What are you looking for,  
The taste of red,  
The taste of fear  
From your seemingly convincing smile  
Red oh red,  
The taste of blood  
On lips of wine  
The time is waiting maybe  
Takes away from your demise  
From your demise  
Say you're slippin'  
Maybe so  
It's not easy  
Now you know
