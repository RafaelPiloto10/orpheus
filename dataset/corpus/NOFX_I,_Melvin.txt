  
Mascara hides the sleepless nights  
Years of abuse, the downs and highs  
A lonely drunk staggers on stage  
Weathered and worn, battered and broken, I feel my age  
Like a puppet on strings, look he strums and he sings, I feel like a cartoon  
I'm alone on the stage, I'm the man on the moon  
I'm the deer in the headlights, I'm the fish in the bowl  
I'm on automatic pilot, I am remote controlled  
Just a second guitarist, playing on the 3rd string  
I'm the disclaimer, I'm a walking routine  
I'm happily a cog, stand me up, plug me in  
Like a robot I play all the songs, with a grin  
I am Eric Melvin
