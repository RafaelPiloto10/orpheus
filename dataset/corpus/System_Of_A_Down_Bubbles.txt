Fish that don't drown,  
Life in a bubble jungle,  
I wouldn't frown,  
Not short another chuckle,  
Snake in the ground,  
But I was in there for you,  
Now leaving town,  
Life in a bubble jungle.  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
We're the power struck.  
  
Believing, then kneeling,  
Appeasing,  
The power struggle.  
  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle,  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
  
Wearing a crown,  
Life in a bubble jungle,  
Chasing a clown,  
Not short another chuckle,  
Snake in the ground,  
But I was waiting for you,  
Now we have found,  
Life in a bubble jungle.  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
We're the power struck.  
  
Believing, then keeling,  
Appeasing,  
The power struggle.  
  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle,  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
Left with no arms,  
In the power struggle,  
Left with no arms,  
In the power struggle.  
  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you.  
  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you.  
  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
May I remind you,  
Your life is in a bubble jungle.  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
We're the power struck.  
Believing, then keeling,  
Appeasing,  
The power struggle.  
  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle,  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
Left with no arms,  
In the power struggle,  
Left with no arms,  
Right here in the power struggle.
