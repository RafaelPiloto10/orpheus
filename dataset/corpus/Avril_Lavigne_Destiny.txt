Destiny  
  
Searching for my destiny  
Not knowing where to look  
Searching all over the world  
Pointless, without a system  
  
Where is my destiny?  
Where and what is my destiny?  
You will always know  
That I'm looking for it with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is it in the sky?  
Under the sea or on the ground?  
In a wood or in the deserts?  
On a mountain or in a valley?  
  
Together we will find our destiny  
Together we will search  
All those years, looking  
All those years, pointless  
  
Why do I say it was pointless  
Looking for it with you  
I will give you the reason  
My destiny... Is you...
