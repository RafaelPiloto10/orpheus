I know there's a prayer flowing from  
The longing for the healing to come  
Someday no more dark, aching nights  
Someday I will open your eyes  
The light will come and I will set you free  
Sometimes there's a joy in the pain  
Sometimes peace that can't be explained  
Some find a longing there in their souls  
Someday I will make all things whole  
I promise to set the children free.  
  
Someday you'll find your place in the sun  
Someday when all hearts beat as one  
You'll sing with the heart of a child  
Someday when the river runs wild  
My Father comes to set His children free.  
  
Some say it's a vision  
Some say it's just a dream  
I say it's a promise  
A covenant, a destiny  
I will come to set my children free.  
  
Someday what the young ones have dreamed  
Someday all you've hoped and believed  
Will be, you will all understand  
The longing placed inside every man  
Overcomes the world and sets the children free  
And I will come to set my children free.
