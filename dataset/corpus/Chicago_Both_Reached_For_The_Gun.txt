(bandmaster speaking)  
Mr. Billy flynn and the press conference rag  
Notice how his mouth never moves...... Almost  
  
Where'd you come from  
Mississippi  
And your parents  
Very wealthy  
Where are they now  
Six feet under  
But she was granted one more start  
The convent of the sacred heart  
  
When'd ya get here  
1920  
How old were you  
Don't remember  
Then what happened  
I met amis, then he stole my heart away  
Convinced me to elope one day  
  
(mary sunshine)  
Oh you poor dear I can't believe what you've been through  
A convent girl  
A runaway marriage, now tell us roxie  
Who's fred casely  
My ex-boyfriend  
(reporters)why'd you shoot him  
I was leaving  
Was he angry  
Like a madman  
Still I said fred move along  
She knew that she was doing wrong  
  
Then describe it  
He came toward me  
With the pistol  
From my bureau  
Did you fight him  
Like a tiger  
He had strength and she had none  
And yet we both reached for the gun  
  
Oh yes  
Oh yes  
Oh yes we both  
Oh yes we both  
Oh yes we both  
Reached for  
The gun

Not a bit reprehensible, its sooo de-fen-si-ble

How ya feelin'  
Very frightened  
(mary sunshine)  
Are you sorry  
(roxie speaking)  
Are you kidding?  
What's your statement  
All I'd say is  
Though my choo-choo jumped the track  
I'd give my life to bring him back  
And  
Stay away from  
What  
Jazz and liquor  
And  
And the men who  
What  
Play for fun  
And what  
That's the thought that  
Yea  
Came upon me  
When  
When we both reached for the gun!!!!!!!!!!
