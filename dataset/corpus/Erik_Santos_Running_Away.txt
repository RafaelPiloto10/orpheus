You said that I will always be the one for you  
Tell me babe who's that guy you kissed last night  
You know how much I really love you  
Seems you just can't keep your love from dying tonight  
  
Chorus  
Running away from the places and things that make me think of you  
But I guess there's just no letting go  
All these feelings I ache inside  
Running away  
I've been trying so hard to keep away from you  
Now forgetting you is all I have to do  
That's why I'm running away from you  
  
The times that we've been through  
Are always on my mind  
And I never thought that there would be an end  
Oh how I wish that this was all a dream  
Hurting me inside all over again  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
After all I gave to you  
Your love is still untrue  
Now there's nothing I can do  
But to run away  
  
Repeat
