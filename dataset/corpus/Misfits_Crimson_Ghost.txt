Whoa  
I know your every move behind this face  
I have control over expendable slaves  
When confrontation comes down to the wire  
I'll use my cyclotrode and commence the fire  
  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
  
Being followed, I get quick to the chase  
I take my cyclotrode right out of the case  
Atomic force electrocutes your motor  
Leaving dead in flames I always escape  
  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost  
Never gonna get me  
I'm the crimson ghost
