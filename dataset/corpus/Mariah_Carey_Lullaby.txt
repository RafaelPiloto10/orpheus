Chorus 1  
Should Just Hug You Goodbye  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
  
Verse 1  
Hey Boy, What's Going On  
Thanks, I'm Doing Okay  
Don't Believe Rumours- Hey  
How's Your Family  
Please Say Hello For Me  
Guess We've Both Grown Up A Bit  
But I Have To Admit  
It Really Still Feels Good  
Here By Your Side  
Sitting Right Next To You  
Just Like I Used To Do  
You Know We Can't Deny  
No One Else In Our Lives  
Holds A Candle To You And I  
  
Chorus 1  
Should Just Hug You Goodbye  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
  
I Should Just Hug You Goodbye  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
  
Verse 2  
So Here We Are Again  
All By Ourselves  
So Familiar You Know  
That It Actually Almost Feels Like Deja Vu  
Of That Night On The Roof  
We Kissed Under The Sky Amid City Lights  
A Sudden Flashback To So Long Ago  
In The Dark All Alone  
With Our Bodies This Close  
Guess Some Things Never Change  
Cause I Still Melt Away  
When You Touch Me  
And Say My Name  
  
Chorus  
Should Just Hug You Goodbye (Baby)  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise (So I Guess)  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
(I'll Come And Love You To Sleep)  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
(Revisit Paradise For A While)  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight (By Your Side)  
(Lullaby)  
  
I Should Just Hug You Goodbye (See I Know I Should But Boy)  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
(You Just Look So Good)  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
(So I'll Sing That Song)  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
(You Like To Hear Me Sing As We Revisit Us)  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
  
(It Feels, Feels Good)  
  
I Should Just Hug You Goodbye  
(I Can't Walk Away  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
From Paradise So I'll Take You Home And Sing To You Baby)  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
(Though I Know That I Should Just)  
  
I Should Just Hug You Goodbye  
(Oh I Can't, .. Cause You)  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
(You And I Both Know)  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
(Nobody Else In Our Lives Holds A Candle To You And I)  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
  
I Should Just Hug You Goodbye Shhh!  
(So Hush Pretty Baby)  
But I Just Can't Walk Away From Paradise  
(Mmm, It's Just Me And You Yeah, As We Relive The Splendor Of You And I)  
So I Guess I'll Sing You That Sweet Lullaby  
And We Can Revisit Us One More Time  
Yes, I'll Come Home With You Tonight  
(I'm Gonna Sing Our Sweet Lullaby)
