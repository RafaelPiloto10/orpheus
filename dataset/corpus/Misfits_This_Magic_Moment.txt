This magic moment  
So different and so new  
Was like any other  
Until I kissed you  
  
And then it happened  
It took me by surprise  
I knew that you felt it too  
By the look in your eyes  
  
Sweeter than wine  
Softer than the summer night  
Everything I want I have  
Whenever I hold you tight  
  
This magic moment  
While you lips are close to mine  
Will last forever  
Forever 'til the end of time  
  
Oh.......  
Oh.......  
Mm......  
  
Sweeter than wine  
Softer than the summer night  
Everything I want I have  
Whenever I hold you tight  
  
This magic moment  
While your lips are close to mine  
Will last forever  
Forever 'til the end of time  
  
Oh.......  
Magic moment......  
Magic moment......  
Magic moment......
