I'm an artist honey  
You'll see me sometimes  
Making crazy pictures out of music and rhymes  
Costume changes perform with poise  
Dancing in formation with a couple of boys  
I take them on the road with my reel-to-reels  
I'm an artist honey  
You know how that feels?  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
It's about wonder  
The power to be like thunder  
Expressing electricity  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
Call it performance call it art  
I call it disaster if the tapes don't start  
I've put all my live into live lip-sync  
I'm an artist honey  
You gonna get me a drink?  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes  
It's about wonder  
The power to be like thunder  
Expressing electricity  
It's the greatest show with the best effects  
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes
