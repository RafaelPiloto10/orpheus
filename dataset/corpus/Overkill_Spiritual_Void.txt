Bless me with that special pain,  
That makes a man feel right as rain.  
My soul-a-fire, feelin' so alive in your own way.  
  
If you need a reason,  
To get some healin'.  
If your spirit's bleedin'  
Then get some healin'!!!  
  
I need a new religion!!!  
  
Laughin' like a true believer,  
Laughin' hard the true deceiver.  
Without a worry in this world no friend of time.  
  
Do we get higher?  
Ha ha ha higher  
Are we all higher?!  
In a spiritual void.  
  
One for neglecting me,  
And two on the way to three.  
No I never felt so low I never, felt so low as in this void!  
  
Bless us all with what we need!  
Self indulgent constant greed.  
What's mine is mine is mine you get your own leave me alone.  
  
Spiritual void.
