How do I stop loving you  
Writers artie butler, norman martin  
  
I'm trying so hard to forget you.  
And leave the life we had behind.  
And there are times I feel the day has come,  
I've chased you from my mind.  
But I'm afraid there's always something,  
That sets me back and makes me see.  
You're more than just a memory in the past,  
You're still a part of me.  
So how do I stop loving you?  
Forget things that we used to do?  
Forget all the dreams that we shared?  
And how my life was knowing you cared?  
Why do I end up where I start, each time I try?  
Just tell me how I can forget,  
So I can say goodbye...  
I'm tired of all the lonely evenings,  
And all the many times I've cried.  
I'm tired of wondering what I might have done to keep you by my side.  
And reaching out across your pillow,  
I start remembering you're gone.  
And though I know that we can never be,  
The pain in me goes on.  
So how do I stop loving you?  
Forget things that we used to do?  
Forget all the dreams that we shared,  
And how my life was knowing you cared?  
Why do I end up where I start, each time I try?  
Just tell me how I can forget,  
So I can say goodbye...  
So how do I stop loving you?  
Please tell me why...  
I find it so hard to forget.  
And hard to say... Goodbye.  
Goodbye...
