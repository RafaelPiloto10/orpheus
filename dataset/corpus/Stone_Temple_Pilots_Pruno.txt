Falling farther with a flaming hand  
I knew the question but I lost the answers  
I'll hold the wall for all  
I'll hold it all for all  
As long as no one asks no questions.  
  
I got the message  
And the message stood  
  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another  
I got another hit that held me the last time  
Don't ya know what I mean boys?  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another.  
  
Falling fast but doing all I can  
I know the questions but I lost the answers  
I got the message and the message stood  
  
Lease the one who makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
Kill the one that breaks it  
Always in the middle  
Keep the dream alive  
with sleeping pills you shouldn't fiddle  
Lease the one that makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
  
I got the message but I lost the race  
I got the message but I lost the race
