"Don't Get Me Started"  
  
Don't want to be another craze  
How about rather not see and I turn my face  
Don't want to leave you unfinished  
And resting on the noise that you left  
I don't want to leave you mistaken, forsaken  
Lying with the rest  
  
I don't want you to be another  
Touch, you talk the conversation  
I don't want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
  
I don't want to be a woman last  
Yeah I wish you another man  
I don't want you to kill my name  
And ask if I'm hovering him  
I won't send and gather dust  
In the corners of your world  
Cause believe me, when you leave me  
It won't be a minute too soon  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
  
I don't want you to be another  
Touch, you talk the conversation  
I don't want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started
