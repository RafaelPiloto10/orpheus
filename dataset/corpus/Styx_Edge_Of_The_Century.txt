Living on the edge of the century  
  
See the world in revolution  
Spinning faster all the time  
We're heading for the end of something  
Just about to step across that line  
Oh, can't you see?  
We're staring in the face of reality  
Oh, you and me  
We're living on the edge of the century  
  
Feel the way the earth is shaking  
Hear the rumble miles away  
Say goodbye to Checkpoint Charlie  
Walls are falling every day  
Oh, can't you see?  
Every step we take we're making history  
Oh, you and me  
We're living on the edge of the century  
  
Feel the way the earth is shaking  
Fires and floods and hurricanes  
A voice cries out in revelation  
"Say hello to Y-2-K!"  
Oh, can't you see?  
We're jumpin on the ledge of uncertainty  
Oh, you and me  
We're living on the edge of the century  
  
Can't turn off the information  
Can't sit back in your easy chair  
Can't ignore a generation  
Better get ready cause we're almost there  
  
We're moving at the speed of life  
Into a brave new world where the strong will survive  
The dawn's gonna break and I'll meet you  
On the other side  
  
Can't stand still while the earth is turning  
Can't take cover til the coast is clear  
Can't play guitar while Rome is burning  
Look our now cause the future's here  
  
And we're moving at the speed of life  
Living on the edge  
On the edge of the century
