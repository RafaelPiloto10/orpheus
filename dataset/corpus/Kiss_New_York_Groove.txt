Many years since I was here, on the street I was passin' my time away  
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky  
It's outta sight in the dead of night  
Here I am, again in this city, with a fistful of dollars  
And baby, you'd better believe  
  
Chorus:  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove  
  
In the back of my Cadillac  
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' 'Where are we? '  
Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night  
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me  
  
Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow  
So baby, you'd better believe  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove (repeats out)
