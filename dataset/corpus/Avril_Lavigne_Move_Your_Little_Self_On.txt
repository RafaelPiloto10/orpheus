I will move my little self on  
It won't be very much longer  
One day soon he will find me  
I know this because I believe  
  
If I get to know myself better  
I will be a little bit stronger  
I won't forget everything you told me  
Yeah I miss, the way you'd hold me  
The words you told me  
  
[Chorus]  
Things happen for a reason, you'll become a stronger person  
When life tears you up, then you'll understand  
It's never easy, but you'll know when you get there  
As it tears you down, it builds you up  
Well, it built you up  
  
Some girls fall, just like I did  
They break our hearts, I should've broke his  
Get yourself up, strut along further,  
My advice, you can do better  
Just say whatever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, you said you would love me forever  
Well, blablablablablablabla  
You should maybe watch what you're saying  
Why, why, why  
  
[Chorus] 2x
