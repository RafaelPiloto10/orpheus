Aynsley: When you just stopped it was running on your head  
Howard: Well I had to do an Edward Arnold slow-burn, man, there was nothing

Aynsley: I said the only other thing to do is go get another can of beer and
pour it over his head. ..  
Howard: Well, it was already getting silly, man. I mean, it was remedial as it

Together" and pour a whole glass of water over my head, man, and he liked it
