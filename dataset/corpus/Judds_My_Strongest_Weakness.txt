The keeper of the gates of wisdom  
Please let me in  
Cause I just can't go through  
Another heartache again  
Pretty lies and alibis  
How could I be so blind?  
Now I'm all alone and scared to stay  
Slowly going out of my mind  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long, long time  
'Til I regain control  
I'm still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And I'm afraid hell always be  
  
I gave my faithful heart to someone  
I couldn't understand  
How he held my little world  
In the palm of his hand  
Now he's gone and life goes on  
So if this pain will ever end  
Will I be afraid to risk it all  
Ever fall in love again?  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long, long time  
Til I regain control  
I'm still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And I'm afraid hell always be
