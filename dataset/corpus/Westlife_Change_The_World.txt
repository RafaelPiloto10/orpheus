Since you've gone, well it  
Seems like everything is wrong  
And deep inside, I know that I've  
Lost much more than pride  
Well happiness is getting further away  
Girl I miss more than words can say  
I need a miracle now  
So tell me  
  
How can I change the world  
'Cos I sure can't change your mind  
Where's the miracle I need now  
Got to get to you somehow  
'Cos I can't change the world  
I can't change the world  
No I can't change the world  
  
Losing you, well it's been the hardest  
Thing to do  
So I close my eyes and tell myself  
That somehow I'll survive  
Well you gave me heaven then you  
Took it away  
Girl I miss you more with each  
Passing day  
I need a miracle now  
So tell me...  
  
How can I change the world  
'Cos I sure can't change your mind  
Where's the miracle I need now  
Got to get you somehow  
  
And it's so sad you're leaving me  
Just so you can find yourself  
And it's so sad that you just can't see  
I love you more than life itself  
  
No I can't change the world  
  
How can I change the world  
'Cos I sure can't change your mind  
Where's the miracle I need now  
Got to get to you somehow  
'Cos I can't change the world  
Got to get you somehow  
No I can't change the world  
I can't change the world  
No I can't change the world
