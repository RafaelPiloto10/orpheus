I remember Christopher  
such a man  
so brave and tall  
  
he took the baby Jesus  
in his arms  
across the waterfall  
  
people cried, "he's holy!  
he's a saint not a man!"  
all at once it was written  
in the book of the land  
  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
  
there was Mary Margaret  
a Christian lady  
dressed in black  
  
she believed St. Christopher  
helped her find  
a way back  
  
she told him all her secrets  
and the dreams of her years  
so when they took that saint away  
all that's left were her tears  
  
Mary cried "they're crazy!  
the world is changing too fast!"  
it was then she discovered  
that her faith couldn't last  
  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?  
Christopher, Mr. Christopher  
why won't they leave you alone?
