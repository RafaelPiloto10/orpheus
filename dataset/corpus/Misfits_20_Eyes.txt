20 Eyes in my head  
20 Eyes in my head  
20 Eyes in my head  
They're all the same, they're all the same  
  
20 Eyes in my head  
20 Eyes in my head  
They're all the same, they're all the same  
  
When you're seeing 20 things at a time  
You just can't slow things down, baby  
When you're seeing 20 things in your mind  
Just can't slow things down  
  
Then all those eyes  
They're just crowding up your human face  
Then all those eyes  
Take an overload  
  
20 Eyes in my head  
20 Eyes in my head  
20 Eyes in my head  
They're all the same, they're all the same
