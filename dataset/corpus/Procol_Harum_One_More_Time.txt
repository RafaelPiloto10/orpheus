Good to get your message  
So you're coming back home again  
Just can't wait to see you  
No need to explain  
A friend of mine told me  
That you've found yourself a new man  
I'm feelin' really good for you  
Hope you understand  
I've still got your picture  
I'm sure you know  
We had something special  
Where did it go?  
  
One more time  
Let's remember how good it felt  
One more time  
Remember what we meant  
One more time  
Can't help wondering where it went  
One more time  
Just one more time  
  
I wonder if you finished  
Workin' on that book  
Maybe I could come 'round sometime  
'n take a look  
A friend of mine told me  
That you've changed your hair  
They say you're really different now  
I remember how you were  
I've still got your picture  
I'm sure you know  
We had something special  
Where did it go?  
  
One more time  
Let's remember how good it felt  
One more time  
Remember what we meant  
One more time  
Can't help wondering where it went  
One more time  
Just one more time
