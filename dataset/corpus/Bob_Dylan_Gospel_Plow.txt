Mary wore three links of chain  
Every link was Jesus name  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Mary, Mark, Luke and John  
All these prophets are dead and gone  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Well, I've never been to heaven  
But I've been told streets up there  
Are lined with gold  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.
