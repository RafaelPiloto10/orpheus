Foolish heart looks like we're here again  
Same old game of plastic smile  
Don't let anybody in  
Hiding my heartache, will this glass house break  
How much will they take before I'm empty  
Do I let it show, does anybody know?  
  
[Chorus]  
But You see the real me  
Hiding in my skin, broken from within  
Unveil me completely  
I'm loosening my grasp  
There's no need to mask my frailty  
'Cause You see the real me  
  
Painted on, life is behind a mask  
Self-inflicted circus clown  
I'm tired of the song and dance  
Living a charade, always on parade  
What a mess I've made of my existence  
But You love me even now  
And still I see somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wonderful, beautiful is what You see  
When You look at me  
You're turning the tattered fabric of my life into  
A perfect tapestry  
I just wanna be me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And You love me just as I am  
  
Wonderful, beautiful is what You see  
When You look at me
