Hey, hey, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
Play the drum a little louder,  
Tell me I can live without her  
If I only listen to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!  
Weren't they good, they made me happy.  
I think I can make it alone.  
  
Oh, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
Play the drum a little bit louder,  
Tell them they can live without her  
If they only listen to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!  
Now weren't they good, they made me happy.  
I think I can make it alone.  
  
Oh, woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
C'mon, play the drums just a little bit louder,  
Tell us we can live without her  
Now that we have listened to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!
