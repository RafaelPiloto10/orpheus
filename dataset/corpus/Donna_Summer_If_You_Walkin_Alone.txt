When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the crowd  
And you're pushing the world behind you  
Hold don't lose yourself in a crowded place  
Or I doubt it if I'll find you  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Don't try to run away  
Just wait for me  
And baby you'll see  
We'll make it through the day  
When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the heat  
And the people you meet aren't kind  
You just put your head out  
And take a step  
And there's no mountain we can't climb  
Oh when you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything  
Please come with me  
We'll laugh and we'll be glad  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Don't try to run away  
Just wait for me and baby you'll see  
We'll make it through the day  
Through the day  
When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the crowd  
And you're pushing the world behind you  
Hold don't lose yourself in a crowded place  
So I doubt it if I'll find you  
When you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything please come with me  
We'll laugh and we'll be glad  
Please come  
Please come  
Please come  
Yeah....
