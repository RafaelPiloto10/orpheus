We're a couple of swells  
We stop at the best hotels  
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells  
We're a couple of sports  
The pride of the tennis courts  
In June, July and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts  
The Vanderbilts have asked us up for tea  
We don't know how to get there, no siree  
No, siree  
  
We would drive up the Avenue, but we haven't got the price  
We would skate up the Avenue, but there isn't any ice  
We would ride on a bicycle, but we haven't got a bike  
So we'll walk up the Avenue  
Yes, we'll walk up the Avenue  
And to walk up the Avenue's what we like  
  
Wall Street bankers are we  
With plenty of currency  
We'd open up the safe but we forgot where we put the key  
We're the favorite lads  
Of girls in the picture ads  
We'd like to tell you who we kissed last night but we can't be cads  
The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club  
But how are we to get there, that's the rub  
That's the rub  
  
We would sail up the Avenue, but we haven't got a yacht  
We would drive up the Avenue, but the horse we had was shot  
We would ride on a trolley car but we haven't got the fare  
So we'll walk up the Avenue  
Yes, we'll walk up the Avenue  
Yes, we'll walk up the Avenue till we're there  
  
We would swim up the Avenue but we haven't any lake  
So we'll walk up the Avenue  
Yes, we'll walk up the Avenue  
Yes, a walk up the Avenue's what we'll take
