Gonna take a sentimental journey  
Gonna set my heart at ease  
Gonna make a sentimental journey  
To renew old memories  
  
Got my bag, got my reservation  
Spent each dime I could afford  
Like a child in wild anticipation  
Long to hear that "All aboard"  
  
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven  
I'll be waitin' up for heaven  
Countin' every mile of railroad track  
That takes me back  
  
Never thought my heart could be so 'yearny'  
Why did I decide to roam?  
Gotta take that sentimental journey  
Sentimental journey home,  
  
Sentimental journey!
