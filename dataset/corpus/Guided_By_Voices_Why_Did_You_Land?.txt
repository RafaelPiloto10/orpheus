Standing around  
Hoping everything works out  
'Cause I want them all to work out  
You were always so in love with the truth  
Why did you change?  
Why did you land?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at the photograph  
Nothing is real  
Spend another lonely life  
With nothing to feel  
  
Was it something  
In the stories everyone told you?  
You needn't heed them  
Maybe you should read them  
Go back to where you came from  
Why did you land?  
You couldn't have stayed in flight forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?
