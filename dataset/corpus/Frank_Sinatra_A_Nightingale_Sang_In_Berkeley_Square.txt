That certain night, the night we met  
There was magic abroad in the air  
There were angels dining at the Ritz  
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
I may be right, I may be wrong  
But I'm perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me  
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
The moon that lingered over London town  
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown  
How could he know we two were so in love?  
The whole darn world seemed upside down  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars  
It was such a romantic affair  
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars  
It was such a romantic affair  
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
I know 'cause I was there  
That night in Berkley Square
