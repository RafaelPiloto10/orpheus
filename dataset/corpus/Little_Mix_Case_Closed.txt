Hits when I'm asleep right through  
I'm cold when I wake cause I won't feel you  
When I can't breathe I know it's you  
Got a lump in my throat just thinking of you  
  
Makes no difference you've been tried  
(Makes no difference you've been tried)  
Still sick inside, oh oh  
It's meant to be over now  
But I think we're going down (we're going down)  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And I'm still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
Case closed  
  
Behind these walls, so tall  
I don't wanna climb, I'm afraid to fall  
So we both do time and never have closure cause I still wanna hold ya  
  
Makes no difference you've been tried  
(Makes no difference you've been tried)  
Still sick inside, oh oh  
It's meant to be over now  
But I think we're going down (we're going down)  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And I'm still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
  
They can never, never be a  
Never be a  
Never, never be a  
Case closed  
  
They can never, never be a  
Never, be a  
Never, never be a  
Case closed  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be
