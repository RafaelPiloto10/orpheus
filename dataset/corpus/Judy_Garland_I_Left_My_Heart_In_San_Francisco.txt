I left my heart  
In San Francisco  
High on the hill  
It calls to me  
  
To be where little cables cars  
Climb halfway to the stars  
The morning fog may chill the air  
I don't care  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me
