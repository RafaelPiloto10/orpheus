First you have to say you love me  
It's no good unless you do  
'Cause I need to hear you love me  
Baby, just like you  
Yes, I need to hear forever  
And if forever it never comes  
Well at least I heard you say it  
If only just for once  
Just like you,  
I need to be remembered  
Just like you  
I need to know you care  
It takes to of us to be together  
Just like one  
When it's said and done  
That's only fair  
We could live for just the moment  
But that moment it's gonna pass  
Can't you see it's now or never  
But if we need to be together  
It's time for you and me to say forever  
For how's it gonna last  
Yes, I need to hear you love me  
Baby, just like you
