What you waiting for, gazing  
What you waiting, what you watching the skies for  
What you waiting the holes are for water let the fall let the clothes in let
the clothes on  
Keep your clothes on  
Whoever you love,  
Whoever, you look happy  
I feel dazed, I feel day's orange glow  
With a pineapple head  
Walks in the sun  
With a friend the mouse, with a friend the shadow  
  
War machine, war machine  
Wrap her arms, wrap her arms around me  
War machine, war machine  
Come to wrap her arms, tight to wrap her body  
  
She move fast, she move slow  
She move down into the water  
I remember her, I remember her unnatural  
I was leaving you  
What you looking for, gazing  
Your voice, I'm not incredible  
Your voice, in desperation  
I hear you  
I hear you bleeding  
  
Between her arms are tight  
Wrapped around her body  
She move fast, she look down  
She won't look in my eyes  
I remember now  
Her unnatural surprise  
  
What you waiting for, gazing  
What you waiting, what you watching the skies for  
What you waiting the holes are for water let the fall let the clothes in let
the clothes on  
Keep your clothes on  
Whoever you love,  
Whoever, you look happy  
I feel dazed, I feel day's orange glow  
With a pineapple head, walks in the sun  
With a friend the mouse, with a friend the shadow  
  
War machine, war machine  
Wrap her arms, wrap her arms around me  
War machine, war machine  
Come to wrap her arms, tight to wrap her body
