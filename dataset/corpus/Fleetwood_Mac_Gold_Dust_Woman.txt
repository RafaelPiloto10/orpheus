Rock on gold dust woman  
Take your silver spoon  
Dig your grave  
  
Heartless challenge  
Pick your path and I'll pray  
  
Wake up in the morning  
See your sunrise loves to go down  
Lousy lovers pick their prey  
But they never cry out loud  
Cry out  
  
Did she make you cry  
Make you break down  
Shatter your illusions of love  
And is it over now do you know how  
Pick up the pieces and go home.  
  
Rock on ancient queen  
Follow those who pale  
In your shadow  
  
Rulers make bad lovers  
You better put your kingdom up for sale  
Up for sale  
  
Well did she make you cry  
Make you break down  
Shatter your illusions of love  
And is it over now, do you know how  
Pickup the pieces and go home.  
  
Well did she make you cry  
Make you break down  
Shatter your illusions of love  
And now tell me  
Is it over now, do you know how  
Pickup the pieces and go home  
Go home  
Go home  
  
Pale  
Shadow  
Of a woman  
Pale  
Shadow  
Of a dragon  
Dust woman  
  
Pale  
Shadow  
Of a woman  
Black widow  
Pale  
Shadow  
She's a dragon  
Gold dust woman  
Woman, woman
