No one's going to give it away.  
They make it hard for the people today.  
To get what you want, you've got to do it yourself.  
Don't be afraid to drive the nail in the wood.  
Or drink the bottle if it tastes so good.  
You'll go the distance. You never thought that you could.  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it, oh, yeah!  
  
Cough up the cash when you go over and over.  
Before the old one's gone, you've got a new owner.  
You need assistance when your head's in the clouds.  
You could live easy if life stood still.  
You could be faking and breaking and taking it all.  
But then you know you're gonna fall.  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
  
Don't have to take it so hard.  
Don't have to take it so, so hard.  
Don't have to take it so hard.  
Don't have to take it so hard!  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
  
Reach out, reach out.  
Take what you want.  
Reach out, reach out.  
Take what you want.
