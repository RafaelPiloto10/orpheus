I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life on stages with ten thousand people watching  
But we are alone yeah, and I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I've treated you unkindly many times, but baby can't you see  
There's no one more important to me  
Baby, baby can't you see through me  
We are alone, and I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front when I was hiding (but you have nothing to hide)  
And now I'm so much better, and if my words, they don't come together  
Listen to the melodies (listen to the melodies)  
Cause my love, ooh baby, cause my love, cause my love, ooh  
Is in there, ooh, is in there hiding  
Baby I loved you in a place (in a place, in a place, in a place)  
Where there's no space or time  
(Baby I loved you) I loved you all my life  
You became a friend of mine  
And when my life is all over  
Remember when we were together, when we were alone  
And I was singing this song for you  
For only you, only you, oh  
I was singing my song for nobody but you
