Take the ribbon from YOUR hair  
Shake it loose and let it fall  
Layin' soft upon MY skin  
Like the shadows on the wall  
  
Come and lay down by my side  
Till the early mornin' light  
All I'm takin' is your time  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care what's right or wrong  
I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
'Cause tonight I need a friend  
  
But yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care what's right or wrong  
I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
'Cause tonight I need a friend  
  
'Cause yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't wanna be alone  
Help me make it through the night
