I told you once and  
I told you twice  
you will fall and  
I will rise  
tell me now who's fooling who  
one of us must surely die  
it isn't me, it must be you  
you're my holy sacrifice  
hairtrigger-telling you no lies  
hairtrigger-time to say goodbye  
you will cry and  
you will pray  
there's no escape  
it's judgement day!  
deep inside you know too well  
in my hands i hold your fate  
in the end we'll meet in hell  
you're my holy sacrifice  
hairtrigger-now the time has come  
hairtrigger-nowhere left to run  
hairtrigger.
