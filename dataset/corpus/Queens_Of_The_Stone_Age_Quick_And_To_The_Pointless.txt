I don't even know what I'm doin' here  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
Oh  
  
A little girl, can never see  
Awkward, stumbling, gotta be with me  
I know, you know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby baby yes I swear  
Who  
  
Blamin' this heart  
With a lesson to be borne  
I'm so old, you're so young!  
  
I know, you know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear  
Goddamn it  
Whoa  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
Little girl  
Listen to what I say  
  
You know, I know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear  
Who  
Ah ah oh baby baby yes I swear  
Goddamn it  
Whoa
