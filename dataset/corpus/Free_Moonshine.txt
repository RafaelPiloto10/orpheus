Sitting in a graveyard  
Waiting for the dawn  
Leaning on my tombstone  
Till the night is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh how the moon  
Hangs in black sky  
Wish I could find out  
The reason why  
I sit here alone  
And cry  
  
My woman was so lovely  
Together we were one  
No sunshine in my weary eyes  
Now that she has gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Palm trees whisper to me  
From your spreading height  
Tell me all the lonely stories  
Of the world at night  
  
[Chorus]
