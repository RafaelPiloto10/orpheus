I  
Don't know  
Just where I'm going  
But I'm  
Gonna try  
For the kingdom  
If I can  
Cuz it makes me feel like I'm a man  
When I put a spike into my vain  
And I tell you things aren't quite the same  
When I'm rushing on my run  
And I feel just like Jesus' son  
And I guess  
That I just don't know  
And I guess  
That I just don't know  
  
I  
Have made  
Big decisions  
I'm  
Gonna try  
To nullify my life  
Cuz when the blood  
Begins to flow  
When it shoots up the droppers neck  
When I'm closing in on death  
You can't help  
Not you guys  
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all  
Go take a walk  
And I guess  
I just don't know  
And I guess  
That I just don't know.  
  
I  
Wish that  
I was born a thousand years ago  
I  
Wish that  
I'd sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
In a sailor's suit and cap  
Oh we're from the big city  
Where a man can not be free  
Of all the evils of this town  
And of himself  
And those around  
And I guess that I just don't know  
Oh well I guess that I just don't know.  
  
Heroine  
Be the death of me  
Heroine  
It's my wife and it's my life  
Because a mainer to my vain  
Leads to a center  
In my head  
And then I am better  
Off than dead  
  
Because when the smack  
Begins to flow  
I really don't care anymore  
About all the gin gins  
In this town  
And all the politicians  
Making crazy sounds  
And everybody putting  
Everybody else down  
And all the dead bodies  
Piled up in mounds  
  
Cuz when the smack  
Begins to flow  
I really don't care anymore  
When the heroine is in my blood  
And that blood is in my head  
Man thank God that I'm good as dead  
And thank your God that I'm not aware  
And thank God that I just don't care  
And I guess that I just don't know  
And I guess  
I just don't know
