You see the light?  
Yeah, we in the pit(cra, cra)  
That's why young niggas  
Still kicking dough  
And some of my niggas convicted  
Money,(money, money)  
Power, respect  
Guess I'm addicted,  
Money, power and munition,  
Guess I'm addicted  
  
A date that took the moneyman  
Cause I don't know plus fo' hundred babes  
Making a flip like it's gymnastics  
Hot wheelin', hands stacking  
Callin' my spatula acrobat  
Turnin' a brick to a platinum plat  
You pussy, I double that fish scale  
My pockets are deeper than waterware  
Pluck on the border, I got shizz on the water  
Definite prison, blew the whale  
All nigga checking somethin'  
While hustle my Emi, I ain't kickin' shit  
With it, you hot on the webcam, I'm Peter Parker  
Twelve crest smoking Linkin Park babe  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Money on the table  
You seeing the label?  
Not tellin' no fables  
In time here like a nigga  
In school doing time tables  
Shopping got flavors  
Bend on no cable  
Traveling country to country  
Skipping, unstable  
I'm whipping miss Mable  
Whip, whip, eat, look out,  
The spider, skeet well, velvet Sneider  
Hit my brother Duke  
That's my la ridda(pah, cra)  
Boy, you impostor  
Check your pocket!  
We don't rock with coppers  
Street west side talkin'  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Can see the label?  
Money we making  
Without a major  
If I ain't no cut  
I ain't selling my soul  
Cause everything glitter  
Ain't gold  
Double D tell me don't fall  
The water so cold,  
Your butler gon'get you your phone  
Jump in the black, you do not belong  
Dozen my gibble, they talkin' gibble  
Drop the cocaine-o, no trap the trail  
Adversaries call me the Advocator  
Come in the truck like the Terminator  
They tumple the mac in the elevator  
Money passing ammunition  
Me flip a Rover in a kitchen  
Another thing made us ridiculous  
Can't you see we in the business?  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Solid foundation(solid foundation?)  
Could see the label  
Under rotation, keep guarding your pray  
That's a milli hot  
In that space Coupe that you lookin' at  
Got shit on in Aspen, stopping traffic  
I'm a space cadet  
Time for nothing, took a lot of shit  
Jab bout my reserve  
Ammunition  
We got penny, F in this, we can't retain it  
Baby chopper, baby chopper  
Feel it longer than a towel  
I ain't never been a lame nigga  
Bitch never called me Roger
