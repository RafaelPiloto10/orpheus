I knew I loved you, before I knew you  
The hands of time would lead me to you  
An evening star, watched from afar  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together  
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know  
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow  
And we sing with our dreams among us  
  
Ahhhhhhhh  
Ohhhhahhhhhhhh  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
I knew I loved you, before I found you  
And you had built my world around you  
Now all my days, they're now my nights  
And my tomorrows will all begin and end..... with you  
  
Ooooooo
