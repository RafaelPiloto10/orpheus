I was thinking about miracles  
When you were fast asleep  
Of all the things we tried to find  
It's only love we keep  
And I don't ever want to wake you  
Your dreams are taking you so far  
It's there that I can always touch you  
For love is where you are  
(CHORUS)  
Fall upon me, take love from me  
Nothing is more beautiful to see  
Walk beside me, grow inside me  
All I have, you gave to me  
Each day another miracle  
That time can never take  
If time should come to claim you now  
He knows it's much too late  
So let the gates of dawn fly open  
And cast your light for all to see  
The chains of morning now are broken  
And you are drifting into me  
CHORUS (x2)
