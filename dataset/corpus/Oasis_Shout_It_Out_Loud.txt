Hope we've found our sweet release  
I hope I fill that hole in your soul  
Hope that at last we get some peace  
I hope the light shines on we as one  
  
There'll never be enough to learn  
The river's deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
As we wish the world away  
D'you think it's all a dream  
'cause that's what it seems  
  
Every night we hope and pray  
That we can do enough  
To keep our love  
  
Never be enough to learn  
The river's deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
Shout it out loud
