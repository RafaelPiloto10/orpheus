I sold my car to buy more wine  
I hocked my watch, I've lost track of time  
Days with you went by so fast now I'm trying to relive the past  
You don't know what I've been through getting over you  
  
I've tried to love other women but I can't  
You've really made a mess out of what used to be a man  
I thought I drowned the fire in others but you're still my only lover  
You don't know what I've been through getting over you  
  
Bridge:  
I got some pills from a ol' doctor friend  
The bottle said one every 12 hours for pain  
But this pain I feel aint small that's why I took them one and all  
It was something I had to do to get over you  
  
No, the pain I feel ain't small  
Lord I took them one and all  
It was something I had to do to get over you
