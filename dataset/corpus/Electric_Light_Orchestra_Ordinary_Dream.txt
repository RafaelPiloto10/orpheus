I couldn't really understand at all  
The writing on the wall  
From you to me  
  
A jigsaw puzzle of a twisted tale  
That set its lonely sail  
From you to me  
  
'Cause I tried to get the message  
But it's not understood  
Wide apart and so far away  
It mattered at the start until I realized instead ....  
  
I'm flying in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I couldn't understand a word it said  
The letter that I read  
From you to me  
  
I couldn't fathom out the stuff you wrote  
So I guess it's just a joke  
From you to me  
  
Though reality keeps calling me away from my dream  
And the wreckage isn't all it might have been  
Didn't matter at the start until I realized it did  
  
I'm flying in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm floating in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
Ordinary dream  
  
Ordinary dream
