I can't take this situation  
It's making me feel so blue  
One moment you walked into my life  
And now you're saying that we're through  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
I can't believe that I still feel this way  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
But before you decide that you won't be mine  
You'd better put yourself in my place  
  
You know the circle will come around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
When your lovers bring you down  
And there's no one else around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
  
There's no rhyme or reason  
That keeps me playing along  
I guess that I keep believing  
Inside you, love will know right from wrong  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
But before you decide that you won't be mine  
You'd better put yourself in my place  
  
You know the circle will come around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
When your lovers bring you down  
And there's no one else around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place
