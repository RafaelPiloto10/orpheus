Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
  
Anytime she goes away  
I wonder this time where she's gone  
I wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
  
And this house just ain't a home  
Anytime she goes away  
Oh yeah  
  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
I know it  
Every single day  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness everyday yeah  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't a home  
  
Every time she goes away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Every time she goes away  
  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
Every single time she goes away  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
Miss her every single day  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
I can't leave that thing alone  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Every time she goes away (goes away)  
  
Oh yeah  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't a home  
Every time she goes away (goes away  
  
Oh yeah  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Every time she goes away
