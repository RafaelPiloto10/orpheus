The star of Bethlehem was shining  
Across a Palestinian sky  
The Church of the Nativity was crying  
And we all looked on, who can tell me why?  
Where are the wise men when they're wanted?  
Nowhere to be seen, like thieves in the night  
The desert is drifting ever closer  
The world won't sleep well tonight  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
Lost in the desert or covered in snow  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
If you can find it, please let me know  
The shepherds are in the fields sleeping  
Waiting for a sign to light up the sky  
Heaven is moving ever closer  
The promise of a child born on high  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
Lost in the desert or covered in snow  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
If you can find it, please let me know  
Looking for an answer that escapes me  
(Love set me free)  
If there is a reason, let me know  
(Whoa)  
Drifting slow through time and space not knowing where we are  
How did we ever get this far?  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
Lost in the desert or covered in snow  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
If you can find it, please let me know  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
Lost in the desert or covered in snow  
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?  
If you can find it, please let me know
