Paint the stars in the sky  
On the ceiling above our bed  
Roll through the night with your blood  
Beating hard like a drum inside my head  
Paint the stars in the sky  
That were shining on the night we met  
If we can do this then we can do anything  
Throw the clothes in a pile in the corner on the dirty wood floor  
Open up the big windows and throw a chain on the double locked door  
Open up to the flame  
So strong, it feels so good even though we know that it's wrong  
When we make love I feel complete, like I can do anything  
We can lose ourselves to the far away sound of the noise of the boulevard  
We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars  
The wind sounds just like the ocean  
Blowing big through the trees in my backyard  
I sit alone in a dark room smoking  
And wondering where you are  
You went away when the truth came down  
The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around  
You said that I made you feel weak  
I made you feel like you couldn't do anything  
I try to sing myself to sleep to the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars  
I lay awake with my eyes wide open underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken that should have never been made  
You were cold in your anger  
I was warm in the shame  
I don't have any illusions of the good old days  
If we make it through this then I know that  
We can do anything  
We can do anything  
I'm going to walk all the steps and find a place where I can lie  
Lay on my back in the grass and stare at the stars in the warm night sky  
I'm going to find me a new blonde girl, hungry for the things that don't come
easy in the real world  
She will let me be myself  
I know she will let me do anything  
We can lose ourselves making love all night on a blanket in the neighborhood
park  
We can lose ourselves making love all night underneath the western stars  
We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken should have never been made  
You were cold in your anger  
I was warm in the shame  
I don't have any illusions of the good old days  
If I can make it through this then I know that I can do anything  
I can do anything
