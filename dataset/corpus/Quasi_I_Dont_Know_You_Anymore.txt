I've seen you suffer, you've seen me cry  
I hear your voice in my head from years gone by  
I look at your window, see the curtains move  
I feel your eyes on me, what does that prove?  
  
And I walk right past your door  
I don't know you anymore  
  
Which one was wrong, which one to blame?  
Tell me what would you gain if you win that game?  
Do what you want, do what you will  
It's not yours to choose if I love you still  
But not like I did before  
  
I don't know you anymore
