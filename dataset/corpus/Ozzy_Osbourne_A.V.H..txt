I get up and I get down  
I don't know how to take it  
All the pain makes me scream and shout  
I wonder if I'll make it  
I love the feeling when the magic is just right  
There's no revealing what is hidden in the night  
Riding on a train that I can't control  
No one else to blame and I can't let go  
In the darkness I can feel  
The things that makes me crazy  
Hands of madness cold as steel  
I find it quite amazing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow  
Riding on a train that I can't control  
No one else to blame and I can't let go  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
I'm riding on a train that I can't control  
See no evil, fear no fright  
Never lose the living  
Keep the targets in your sight  
Know the cards you're dealing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let, I gotta it go
