What do you do when you know something's bad for you  
And you still can't let go?  
  
I was naive  
Your love was like candy  
Artificially sweet  
I was deceived by the wrapping  
  
Got caught in your web  
And I learned how to bleed  
I was prey in your bed  
And devoured completely  
  
And it hurts my soul  
Cause I can't let go  
All these walls are caving in  
I can't stop my suffering  
I hate to show that I've lost control  
'Cause I, I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
I should have known  
I was used for amusement  
Couldn't see through the smoke  
It was all an illusion  
  
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)  
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)  
We both can seduce  
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)  
  
I'm about to break  
I can't stop this ache  
I'm addicted to your allure  
And I'm fiendin' for a cure  
Every step I take  
Leads to one mistake  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need  
  
I can't mend  
This torn state I'm in  
Getting nothing in return  
What did I do to deserve  
The pain of this slow burn  
And everywhere I turn  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
  
Every time I try to grasp for air  
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over  
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,  
I let out a silent prayer  
Let it be over, over  
  
Inside I'm screaming  
Begging, pleading  
No more  
  
I don't know what to do  
My heart has been bruised  
So sad but it's true  
Each beat reminds me of you  
  
It hurts my soul  
'Cause I can't let go  
All these walls are caving in  
I can't stop my suffering  
I hate to show that I've lost control  
Cause I  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need, oh  
  
I'm about to break  
And I can't stop this ache  
I'm addicted to your allure  
And I'm fiendin' for a cure  
Every step I take  
Leads to one mistake  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need, Oh  
  
I can't mend  
This torn state I'm in  
Getting nothing in return  
What did I do to deserve  
The pain of this moment  
And everywhere I turn  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I say  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
Only thing I need to do is walk away  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away
