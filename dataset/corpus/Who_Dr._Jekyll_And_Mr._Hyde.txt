Hyde, Hyde.  
Someone is spending my money for me,  
The money I earn I never see,  
In all things I do he interferes,  
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears.  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
When I drink my potion my character changes,  
My whole mind and body rearranges,  
This strange transformation takes place in me,  
Instead of myself everybody can see...  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
Whenever you're with me make sure it's still me,  
I've got to the stage I can't tell which I'll be,  
The loveable fellow who'll buy you a drink,  
Then when he's drunk his he'll change in a wink into...  
  
Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.
