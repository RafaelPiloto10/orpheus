Her face reflects as much of me as any mirror can  
And my image in her eyes is all I know of who I am  
But even as I see myself the lines begin to blur  
For who I am has long been tied and tangled up in her.  
  
And it isn't luck or chance she can read me at a glance  
Not just because she's clever and she's smart  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
It seems like it's been centuries since she and I began  
And both of us took all our chances on a single hand  
Though we took it day to day it's gone from year to year  
And no one ever close to me was ever half as near.  
  
And it isn't any trick or because her mind is quick  
She reaches my conclusions as I start  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
And amazing as it seems she brings magic to my dreams  
Not just because she's mastered magic's art  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
She knows my heart...
