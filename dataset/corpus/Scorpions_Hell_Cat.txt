Fire in her eyes ? burn ?  
Perfume of the skies ?  
Fingers cold as ice ? freeze ?  
Devil in disguise!  
  
Well, she's a, she's a, she's a  
You know that she's a hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat  
(She's gonna scratch up your mind ?)  
You know that guy with piccadilly-eyes  
Was talking to the French boy  
But didn't realize.  
Banana-long-boat-eating  
An' he tried to get a wife  
But he couldn't stay alive  
Well, you know that lad with the rubber-dad  
Paints his fingers yellow, blue, and red.  
An' you also know that she's a liar  
Knowing only her desire ?
