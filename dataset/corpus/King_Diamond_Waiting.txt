Just after midnight, they are bringing me my pills  
Just after midnight, lights are out...at Black Hill  
But they don't know me...they don't know me at all  
Tonight pills will be chills will be kills  
  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take another night  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take it anymore  
  
If I don't take my medication, they will all be here  
But I think I fooled them, I think...I'm in the clear  
"Nursie" doesn't know...this is her last night  
She even brought the key, that's gonna set me free  
  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take another night  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take it anymore  
  
Tonight I'm taking her instead  
My hands are so much stronger  
Than her isty-bitsy little head  
  
Empty eyes are staring at the wall  
I cannot hear her breathing anymore  
  
I'm looking for the key in her hand  
That bluish little hand  
  
Running through the empty halls of this forgotten  
place  
Unlocking doors...that never opens  
But now I've got the key...the key to freedom  
And I'm unlocking doors that never should be opened  
  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take another night  
Waiting in the dark, I cannot take it anymore  
  
6,6,6 miles...I've been running through the woods  
6,6,6 miles...and now before me, the cemetery gates  
  
I climb the gate between life and death  
I walk upon the moolit graves  
I'm home
