It was a blue letter  
She wrote to me  
It's silver words she told  
want to be on the road to paradise  
I want to lover who don't get old.  
  
Do I read a message in your eyes  
You want to love to stay another night  
Baby when your day goes down  
I won't be waitin' around for you.  
  
For every voice you've ever heard  
There's a thousand without a word  
Redbird, don't say you told me so  
Just give me one more song to go.  
  
Do I read a message in your eyes  
You want to love to stay another night  
Baby when you day goes down  
I won't be waitin' around for you.
