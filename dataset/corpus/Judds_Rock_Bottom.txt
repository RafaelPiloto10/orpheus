When you hit rock bottom  
You've got two ways to go  
Straight up  
And sideways  
I have seen my share of hard times  
And I letting you know  
Straight up  
Is my way  
  
Things are tough all over  
But I've got good news  
When you get down to nothing  
You've got nothing to lose  
I was born naked  
But I glory bound  
And a dead end street  
Is just a place to turn around  
  
(Chorus)  
When the sky is the limit  
Up on easy street  
Rock bottom  
Ain't no place to be  
Rock bottom  
Ain't no place for me  
  
When the law of the jungle  
Is the law of the land  
Good luck  
Stayin alive  
I keep a clinched fist under  
This hat in my hand  
Cause only the strong survive  
  
Things are tough all over  
But I've got good news  
When you get down to nothin
