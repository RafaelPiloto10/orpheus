Now that we are close, no more nights morose,  
Now that we are one, the beguine has just begun.  
Now that we're side by side, the future looks so gay,  
Now we are alibied when we say...  
  
From this moment on, you for me dear  
Only two for tea dear, from this moment on,  
From this happy day, no more blue songs,  
Only whoop dee doo songs,  
  
From this moment on.  
For you've got the love i need so much,  
Got the skin i love to touch,  
Got the arms to hold me tight,  
  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight,  
From this moment on, you and i, babe,  
We'll be ridin' high, babe.  
Every care is gone, from this moment on.
