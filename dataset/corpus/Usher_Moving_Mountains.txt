It's like whatever I do  
Oh  
Just can't get through to you  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I'm never gonna tell you nothin' more  
Listen  
  
Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her  
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out  
Used to care, she used to share  
The love that she used to give me can't be found  
I lost my way, she said she'd stay  
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost  
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold  
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us  
And that was before the hurricane came, came in and stopped us  
I told you to leave, but you lied to me  
When you said that, "baby no worries I promise to get us back".  
  
[Chorus]  
I know sorries, just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through  
But it's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)  
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)  
Why just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh  
  
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her  
We rarely even ever say a word  
I really want to give her everything she deserves  
But the bad took away the good  
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired  
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying  
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say  
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it  
I should take it like a man and walk up out it  
Cause we will never be the same, oh  
I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame  
  
[Chorus]  
I know sorries just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through  
Got to move this mountain  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains... (moving)  
It's like moving mountains... (moving)  
Well baby why you just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh  
  
This must be a slow death that I'm travelin' on  
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on  
  
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together (baby yea)  
  
And these hills that I'm travelin' up  
She ain't showin' me love  
I'm down on my love  
  
[Chorus]  
I know sorries just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo  
But it's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains...  
Well baby why you just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh
