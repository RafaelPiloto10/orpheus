Waiting impatiently for you to come  
Wondering if you will always be the one  
Is this good for you  
Is it wonderful for you too  
  
'Cause baby I told you I'm ready for love  
I'm anticipating and waiting for some  
Tell me what to do  
Tell me baby 'cause I love you  
  
It's been so lovely  
Now that I got you  
I've been looking for someone like you  
Someone like you  
  
What do you like to do  
What do you got to say  
Just tell me baby what's on your brain  
'Cause I just want to sit down and talk for awhile  
  
Do you want to make babies ?  
Do you want a career  
Well whatever it is darling, I just want you near  
And we'll be together just you and me dear  
  
It's been so lovely (It's been so lovely)  
Since I find you  
I was praying for someone like you  
Someone like you  
  
Ain't been lonely  
Now that I got you  
I was waiting for someone like you  
Come on come on come on yeah  
  
Been so lovely  
Now that I got you  
I've been waiting for someone like you  
  
Someone like you  
Someone like you...
