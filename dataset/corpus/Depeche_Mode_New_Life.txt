I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger  
  
Complicating, circulating  
New life, new life  
Operating, generating  
New life, new life  
  
Transitions to another place  
So the time will pass more slowly  
Features fuse and your shadow's red  
Like a film I've seen now show me  
  
Your face is hidden and were out of sight  
And the road just leads to nowhere  
The stranger in the door is the same as before  
So the question answers nowhere  
  
I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger
