Come on baby dry your eyes, wipe your tears.  
Never like to see you cry, please forgive me.  
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you, I just needed  
Someone to hold me, to fill the void while you were gone.  
To fill this space of emptiness.  
I'm only human, of flesh and blood I'm made.  
Ooh human, born to make mistakes.  
If five boys in the house say it loud  
If five boys in the house check it out.  
When I lay upon my bed I reminisce then I wish  
That I got you by my side with the cherry red kiss  
Hit me off make it soft hold me tight throughout the night  
You know I'm gonna fight cos the thing we had was right  
But if you go all I know I can't go a day without you  
Here in my arms hypnotized with your charms now  
I'm feeling for you baby ain't you hearing the alarms  
You can't stop all that love that I got  
Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it  
Bring back the better days for me baby  
You gotta bring 'em back cos I'm going crazy  
I go insane with your name up in my brain  
Things will never be the same you ain't up in my frame  
So what you gonna do what you gonna say  
Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way.  
I'm only human, of flesh and blood I'm made.  
Ooh human, born to make mistakes.  
If five boys in the house say it loud.  
If five boys in the house check it out.
