They don't know  
They don't know  
Like I know  
Like I know  
Do you know  
They don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
What my baby  
What my baby  
Put on down  
Put on down  
What my baby  
What my baby  
I just came back from  
I don't know  
I can't count it  
I can't count it  
I just can't find this town  
They don't know  
I'm lookin' for my Sally  
I don't know my baby  
Have you seen her  
Have you freed her yeah  
Have you seen her  
Oooh hhhooo  
Talkin' about my baby  
Goin' down  
Talkin' about my baby  
  
I just came in  
I just came in baby  
I just came in  
I just came in  
Spread the magic baby  
All in my bed  
She got chains, attached to my head  
Talkin' about  
Talkin' about  
Talkin' about my baby  
I don't know about it  
  
They don't know what I know  
They don't know like I know  
All the time I've been hangin' around  
All the time I hang around  
She didn't know  
A she didn't care  
She didn't know  
She didn't care  
And she go walkin' down the street singin'  
Everybody die  
Da da dada da doo doo  
Etc. (scat singing)  
  
They don't know  
Nobody knows  
They don't know  
Just don't know  
Da da da...
