You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley  
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we walk in fields of gold  
So she took her love for to gaze awhile upon the fields of barley  
In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold  
  
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?  
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold  
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.  
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold  
  
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken  
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold  
We'll walk in fields of gold  
  
Many years have passed since those summer days among the fields of barley  
See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold  
You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley  
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky when we walked in fields of gold  
When we walked in fields of gold, when we walked in fields of gold
