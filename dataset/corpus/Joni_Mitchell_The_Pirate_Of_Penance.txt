The pirate anchored on a Wednesday  
And why he came to port I wonder  
To see a lady so my friends say  
She dances for the sailors  
In a smoky cabaret bar underground  
Down in a cellar in a harbor town  
I know he told her love was treasure  
And they would reap the fullest bounty  
He only comes to port for pleasure  
So when the winds of morning  
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone  
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn  
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss  
He'll steal your heart and sail away  
  
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest  
  
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam Of a broken promise in the bay  
  
(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)  
  
He came again to see her  
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday  
  
(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)  
  
I was at sea then  
I didn't see them  
I don't believe what you are saying  
It isn't true I hardly knew him  
Is this some game that you are playing  
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last  
The one who drew him here  
He hasn't come to me since spring last year  
There was a time when he would  
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace  
  
(Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go")  
  
And he would hold me close  
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace  
  
(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)  
  
I was at sea I tell you I was  
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place  
  
(Searching for sails that don't come  
And I guess but I don't know)  
  
Go ask the dancer  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know  
  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know  
  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know
