It's the words you don't say  
That keeps ringing in my ear  
I feel like an idiot  
To think that you really cared  
It's the kiss you don't blow  
that I keep brushing off my chin  
It's the punch you don't throw  
That keeps hurting within  
I only loved you  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
  
It's the words you don't scream  
That being sucked back in  
A dream within a dream  
It's not what you've seen  
It's what you don't understand  
That makes you sharper than  
The ones who  
Take advantage of you  
I only loved you  
  
Sick of this music  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
A cellular goodbye
