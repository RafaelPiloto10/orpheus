Holly holy eyes  
Dream of only you  
Well I am what I am,  
what I believe in  
Holly holy  
Holly holy dreams  
Wanting only you  
Yes she comes  
And I run just like the wind will  
Holly holy  
Sing, sing a song  
Sing, sing a song of songs  
Sing, sing it out loud  
We'll sing a song  
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah - yeah  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the sun will rise in the sky  
Touch a man who can't walk upright  
And the lame man, will be alright  
And I fly  
And I fly  
Holly holy eyes  
Wanting only you  
And I see, will it be for everyone  
Holly holy
