There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that he turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some girls think of  
As handsome to my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone who'll watch over me
