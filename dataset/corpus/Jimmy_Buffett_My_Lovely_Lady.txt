Jimmy Buffett  
When I pay my bills  
Gonna leave these Tennessee hills  
Take my lady to the sea  
That's where we both come from  
That's where we both belong  
Think I'll go back to the Keys.  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause I don't want the thing that brings confusion  
Where people recognize you on a plane  
All I want's the quiet and the comforts  
That livin' with my lovely lady brings.  
  
Somehow we survived the double talk and jive  
Things are looking better all the time  
I owe her all I can 'cause she made me understand  
The simple way that we should live our lives.  
(Chorus)  
  
Let me tell you now she can eat her own weight up in crab meat  
And there's plenty of that down there by the sea  
Well, we're sailing in those warm December breezes  
Sendin' picture post cards back to Tennessee.  
(Repeat chorus)
