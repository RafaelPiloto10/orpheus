Hello  
I've waited here for you  
Everlong  
  
Tonight I throw myself in two  
Out of the red  
Out of her head she sang  
  
Come down and waste away with me  
Down with me  
Slow, how you wanted it to be  
I'm over my head  
Out of her head she sang  
  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  
She sang  
  
Breathe out  
So I can breathe you in  
Hold you in  
And now  
I know you've always been  
Out of your head  
Out of my head I sang  
  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  
She sang  
  
And I wonder  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
