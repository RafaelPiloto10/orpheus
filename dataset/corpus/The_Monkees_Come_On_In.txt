Come on in,  
You sure look good to me.  
Come on in,  
I've learned how lonely I can be.  
  
I guess we'll never know just what went wrong  
You know it's been a whole year has passed us by and gone.  
But we're back together now where we belong  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Come on in,  
I heard your footstep on the stair.  
Come on in,  
I'd know it anywhere.  
  
Your old chair in the corner is justa sitting there waiting.  
It's been a long time anticipating.  
What a long time it's been.  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Over and over I've told myself  
I said, "Son, you've got to lose these blues.  
Get ready for the day when she'll walk in the door."  
So I dusted off your housecoat and I polished up your shoes.  
  
Come on in,  
You know your welcome here.  
Aw, come on in,  
It's been a long, long year.  
  
Now I know why I waited around  
I wouldn't run around town, let them put me down.  
I knew that if I waited I would win.  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Come on in,  
Come on in,  
Aw, come in.
