If I owned Aladdin's lamp  
I'd make all your dreams come true  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
If I owned a magic clock  
Then I'd keep our love brand new  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
Don't ever doubt my feelings  
My love is real  
My darling, I'm revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
I'd wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
My darling, I'm revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
I'd wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do
