Another tragedy in the news,  
Someone shooting down the right to choose.  
It doesn't seem at all that they chose the right way.  
  
Another law I heard got passed today,  
Someone's trying to take my rights away.  
It doesn't seem to me they chose the right way.  
  
It's out of my hands,  
But stuck in my mind,  
In time I find my spine is crooked in design  
I want to be so much more (I want to be so much)  
  
Rescue me  
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand  
  
Rescue me  
From this world, from myself, before I grow old  
Someone rescue me.  
  
Does anybody ever feel this way?  
Does anybody have the guts to say?  
It doesn't seem at all they chose the right way  
(Yo man you're going the wrong way)  
  
Who am I to say I disagree?  
Who am I not to change a thing?  
Because I don't believe they chose the right way  
(Hey man you're going the wrong way)  
  
It's out of my hands,  
But stuck in my mind,  
In time I find my spine is crooked in design  
I want to be so much more (I want to be so much)  
  
Rescue me  
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand...  
  
Rescue me  
From this world, from myself, before I grow old  
Here it comes again  
  
Excuse too weak to stand on  
I'm falling off  
Too weak to stand on  
I'm falling off  
Too weak to hang on  
Falling for you to catch me  
  
Excuse too weak to stand on  
I'm falling off  
Too weak to stand on  
I'm falling off  
Too weak to hang on  
Falling for you to catch me, catch me  
  
I'm afraid  
That no one is changing  
who's to blame?  
Someone save me!  
  
Rescue me  
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand  
  
Rescue me  
From this world, from myself, before I grow old  
Someone rescue me  
  
Save me now, you gotta save me now  
(Save me!)  
  
Save me now, somebody rescue me  
(Save me!)  
  
Save me now, you gotta save me now  
(Save me!)
