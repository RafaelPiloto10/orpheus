There you are  
Looking as fine as can be  
In your fancy car  
I can see you looking at me  
What you want to do  
Are you just going to sit there and stare Baby talk to me  
Tell me what's on your mind, Baby Ohhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Bring it all)  
But i don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (Baby I don't need, No)  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Bring it all)  
Baby your time, your love, your space, your energy. (ohhh)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
[JC from 'N Sync:]  
Baby, What's the deal?  
Would it be too forward if I Told you how I feel  
That's just the way I do my thang  
I'm so for real  
Are you feeling my Timbs, my baggie jeans, my thug appeal  
Do you like it when a man can keep it real, Ohhhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Bring it on, Bring it on)  
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (Diamond rings)  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Ohhh oh Ohh ohhhh)  
Baby your time, your love, your space, your energy. (Ohh baby!)  
  
[Hook:]

[Chorus:]  
  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Bring it on, Bring it on)
