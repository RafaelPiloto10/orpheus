Yesterday's heartbreak, brings tomorrow's tears  
A laugh of remembering, to live through the years  
Yesterday's heartbreak, a love from the past  
I lost you forever, your love is my last  
Well alone, alone, my heart left to wonder  
Alone, alone, my lonely heart does ponder  
Oh-oh-oh-yes, yesterday's heartbreak, your love to be lost  
I gave my love freely, now I pay the cost  
Yesterday's heartbreak, a love from the past  
Well I lost you forever, your love is my last
