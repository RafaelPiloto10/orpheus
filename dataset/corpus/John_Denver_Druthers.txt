If I had my druthers I'd go fishing  
Find myself a lake and a lazy day  
If I had my druthers I'd quit wishing  
Get off the old caboose get on my way  
  
Give me, whole lots of laughter  
Great big barrels of fun  
Nighttime full of romance  
Daytime full of fun  
  
If I had my druthers I'd go flying  
Looking for the things I'd like to see  
If I had my druthers I'd be trying trying  
The only way to be what I can't be  
  
Give me somebody to love me  
Make me feel like the only one  
Something that's worth doing more  
I feel good when it's worked  
  
If I had my druthers I'd go sailing - yes I would  
Catch me camping out on the open sea  
If I had my druthers I'd be singing  
Just how good this good life feels to me - feels so good  
  
It just needs someone to talk to  
Something you can't share  
You don't need no reason for living long  
It's already there - yes it is - ooh ooh  
  
It makes me giggle  
I can't sit down
