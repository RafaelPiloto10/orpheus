Every time it rains  
I think of you  
I think about the sparkle  
In your eyes  
Something 'bout the rain  
That brings beauty  
To everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We'll go dancing  
(Dancing in the rain)  
You look at me  
With your big beautiful  
And it's so gorgeous  
And it's so wonderful  
It's beautiful  
  
I was standing there  
Shyly  
  
And you came up to me  
You said  
"Would like to dance?"  
And fearlessly  
I said yes  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh the rain  
Oh the pain  
I don't care  
As long as I'm with you  
Oh the rain  
Oh the pain  
I still love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh ooh oh  
It's Beautiful
