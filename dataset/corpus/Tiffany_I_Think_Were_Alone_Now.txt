Children behave  
That's what they say when we're together  
And watch how you play  
They don't understand  
And so we're  
  
[Chorus:]  
Running just as fast as we can  
Holdin' on to one another's hand  
Tryin' to get away into the night  
And then you put your arms around me  
And we tumble to the ground  
And then you say  
  
I think we're alone now  
There doesn't seem to be anyone around  
I think we're alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound  
  
Look at the way  
We gotta hide what we're doin'  
'cause what would they say  
If they ever knew  
And so we're  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
I think we're alone now  
There doesn't seem to be anyone around  
I think we're alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
