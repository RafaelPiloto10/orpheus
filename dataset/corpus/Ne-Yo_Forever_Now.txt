Was gonna give you these flowers tonight  
Was gonna ask you to stay  
Practiced so that I would say it just right  
But now there are no words to say  
  
As I watch you kiss him softly  
The same way you kissed me  
  
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now?  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? Ohh  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
  
In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground  
And right before I turn to leave  
  
I watch you kiss him softly  
Then look up and see me  
  
And I scream, "What am I gonna do with forever now?" Wow  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
What do I do now?  
  
Everything you said we would be  
All the things you said we'd do  
I made all my life around the thought of me and you  
  
And I scream "What am I gonna do with forever now?" (What do I do? What do I
do now?)Wow  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? (What do I do? What do I do
now?) Ohh  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? Ey  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
  
What do I do? What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do? What do I do now?  
What do I do now?
