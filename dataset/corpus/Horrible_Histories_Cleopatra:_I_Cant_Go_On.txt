Deafeated by Octavian , who we , we don't respect  
Factum killed in Actum , as my poor Ant , has been decked  
Yeah , I was wrecked.  
Now it's T H E E N D  
I'm sure that spells the end for me  
Octavian will display me in a cage  
The world will gloat.  
I can't go on (sung for a long time till next line)  
Won't be paraded round the streets  
Octavian (long time)  
Not your extoic parakeet  
Won't your spoils from victory  
I'll spoil your party  
I can't go on (long time)  
(Antony)  
I'm miserable , I'm so depressed  
How did it  
Come to this  
Octavian don't like me  
Cause I dumped his  
Plain old sis.  
For Queen Isis  
(Cleopatra)  
I'm trying to sustain our rule  
Don't hold me up to ridicule  
Snap out of this , you moping fool  
You're not helping at all !  
(Antony)  
I can't go on (long time)  
Without my sweet Roman romance  
My love has gone  
Living alone , not in my plans.  
Octavian my boss ?  
I'd sooner eat my hair.  
I can't go on (long time)  
(Octavian)  
I must try and capture Cleo  
(Cleopatra)  
Octavian must not take me-o  
(Antony)  
She'll kill herself just for me ?  
She must adore me !  
( Cleopatra)  
I'll foil Octavian with this plot  
(Antony)  
She's dead ?  
(Cleopatra)  
Not yet I'm not !  
Octavian)  
She must not die (long time)  
So much more popular than me  
Cleopatra)  
And so I die (long time)  
Octavian)  
This'll look bad on my CV  
Antony and Cleo gone.  
What a blooming pair of drama queens ! (long time  
So all hail meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
