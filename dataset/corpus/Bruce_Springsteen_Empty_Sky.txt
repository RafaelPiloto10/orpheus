I woke up this morning  
I could barely breathe  
Just an empty impression  
In the bed there you used to be  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Blood on the streets  
Blood flowin' down  
I hear the blood of my blood  
Cryin' from the ground  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
On the plains of Jordan  
I cut my bow from the wood  
Of this tree of evil  
Of this tree of good  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to the empty sky
