Detour, there's a muddy road ahead  
Detour, paid no mind to what it said  
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Headin' down life's crooked road, lot of things I never knowed  
And 'cause of me not knowin' I now pine  
Trouble got in the trail, spent the next five years in jail  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Detour, there's a muddy road ahead  
Detour, paid no mind to what it said  
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
When I got right to the place where it said about face  
I thought that all my worries were behind  
But the farther I go the more sorrow I know  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Detour, there's a muddy road ahead  
Detour, paid no mind to what it said  
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Didn't have the way of how to get  
From the hole that I'm in yet  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Detour, there's a muddy road ahead  
Detour, paid no mind to what it said  
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find  
Should have read that detour sign  
  
Should have read that detour sign  
Should have read that detour sign
