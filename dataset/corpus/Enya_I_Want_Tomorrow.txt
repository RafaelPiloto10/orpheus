Dawn breaks, there is blue in the sky.  
Your face before me  
Though I don't know why.  
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon.  
  
Waiting here, as I sit by the stone,  
They came before me  
Those men from the Sun.  
Signs from the heavens say I am the one.  
  
Now you're here, I can see your light,  
This light that I must follow.  
You, you may take my life away, so far away.  
Now I know I must leave your spell  
I want tomorrow.
