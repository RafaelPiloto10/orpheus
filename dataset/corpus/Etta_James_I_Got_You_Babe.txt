People say that we don't know  
What love is or how to make it grow  
Well, I don't know if all that's true  
'Cause you got me and baby, I got you  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
Say, our love won't pay the rent  
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent  
I guess that's sure, we don't have a lot  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we've got  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got flowers in the spring, yeah  
I've got you, I've got you to wear my ring  
And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And when I get scared, you're always around  
Let them say we are wrong  
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong  
But with our love like your's and mine  
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got you to hold my hand  
I got you to understand  
I got you to walk with me  
And I got you to talk with me  
I got you to kiss goodnight  
I got you, hold me tight  
I got you, I won't let go  
I got you to love me so  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got you, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe
