Down the street a baby just cried  
When he woke up all alone  
A train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound  
Is chilling me right to the bone.  
  
A song is playing I can barely hear  
About a love that's gone wrong  
The freezing rain on my window pane  
Listen they're playing my song.  
  
Taps being played by a soldier's grave  
So sad it torments your soul  
Just listen to that north wind moan  
Tonight it's so dark and cold.  
  
Somewhere a siren cuts through the night  
Sounds like a whole world's gone wrong  
Thunder just warned but it's coming a storm  
Listen they're playing my song
