Grooving around in a trench coat  
With the satin on trail  
Seems to be all around in tin and lead pail, we pale  
Jiving on down to the beach  
To see the blue and the gray  
Seems to be all and it's rosy-it's a beautiful day!  
  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!  
Yes I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!  
  
Heading down with the light, the dust in your way  
She was angrier than, than her watershell male  
Life to this love to me - heading me down to me  
Thunderbird shale  
Seems to be all and it's rosy - it's a beautiful day!  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt  
  
Grooving on down in a knapsack superlative day  
Some wish she move and just as she can move jiving away  
She made the scene should have been-superlative day  
Everything's all and it's rosy, it's a beautiful day  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt...
