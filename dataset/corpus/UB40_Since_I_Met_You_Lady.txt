Since I met you lady  
My whole life has changed  
Since I met you lady  
My whole life has changed  
And everybody tells me  
That I am not the same  
  
I don't need nobody  
To tell my troubles to  
I don't need nobody  
To tell my troubles to  
Since I met you baby  
All I need is you  
  
Since I met you lady  
I'm a happy man  
Since I met you lady  
I'm a happy man  
I'm going to try and please you  
In everyway I can
