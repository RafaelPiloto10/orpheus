Ooh ooh ooh  
When you wait and you watch  
And you're wishing for something wild  
I figure I can please you someday someway  
I figure I can put your love on trial  
I'm taking you back to school  
Talk about making it something real  
Nobody could deny you anything  
  
[Chorus]  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
  
You you you  
You can run with the fun  
You can tickle my nerves inside  
In the face of heartbreak, heartache  
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride  
Better we make it soon  
Let it be the one that make you  
Cry for more  
Anyone else would buy you anything  
I'd do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything
