Well you've got me working so hard lately.  
Working my hands until they bleed.  
If I was twice the man I could be.  
I'd still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
All of your back up to your chin.  
Over to the tip of your switchblade as you pull it out and stick it in.  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Twist Twist Twist) we can go a little deeper.  
(Twist Twist Twist) I'm wearing these chains.  
(Twist Twist Twist) you make it hurt real good.  
(Twist,Twist,Twist) I love the pain.  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here.  
Hanging like Jesus on the cross.  
I'm just dying for your sins.  
And aiding to the cause.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages.  
I'm tired of this war.  
Go ahead and cut me.  
I can't even feel it anymore.  
  
[Chorus]
