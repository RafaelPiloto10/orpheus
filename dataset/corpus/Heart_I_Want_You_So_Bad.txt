When the wind blows through your hair  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
I see your smile boy everywhere  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
  
I never thought this could happen to me  
If I've fallen over you  
Would it be so bad, would it be so bad  
Every night's an eternity  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
I never thought this could happen to me  
I want you so bad, bad  
  
When the wind blows through your hair  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
Oh I wonder if you're aware  
I want you so bad  
I wonder if you care  
I never thought this would happen to me  
I want you so bad, bad  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad
