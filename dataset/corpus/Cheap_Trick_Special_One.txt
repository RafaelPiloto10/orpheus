Two thousand years gone by and going strong  
Well never fear my love it won't be long  
You say you've had enough, it seems so wrong  
Now it's suicide, oh my love  
  
And now you know just why I'm here  
And now my eyes they see so clear  
No fear  
  
Where do we go from here, it's in your head  
So many tears we'll cry before we're dead  
Remember me my love and what we said  
I will stand by you all night long  
  
And now you know just why I'm here  
And now my eyes can see so clear  
Oh baby  
  
Just like the dreams you grow old and die  
No one pretends to know just why  
I feel the calm before the storm  
I'm here  
  
Kiss me again before you go  
There's something else that you should know  
My life will be hell without you my belle  
Oh, give all my love, my love
