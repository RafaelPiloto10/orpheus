It's such a heavenly sight  
Stars are shining just right  
And if your heart is thumping just like mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
I yearn for one little kiss  
Can't continue like this  
I get a crazy feeling down my spine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
What can I say what can I do  
I love to go around with you  
But dear it's much too much  
When romancing I find that we're going Dutch  
I feel suspended in air  
You suspended me there  
So darling please have pity say you're mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
(Such a heavenly sight)  
(Stars are shining just right)  
(And if your heart is thumping just like mine)  
(Give me a look give me a word give me a sign)  
(I yearn for one little kiss)  
(Can't continue like this)  
(I get a crazy feeling down my spine)  
(Give me a look give me a word give me a sign)  
What can I say what can I do  
I love to go around with you  
But dear it's much too much  
When romancing I find that we're going Dutch  
I feel suspended in air  
You suspended me there  
So darling please have pity say you're mine  
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign  
(Both) Give me a kiss give me a cue give me a hug  
(Both) Give me a clue give me a look give me a word give me a sign
