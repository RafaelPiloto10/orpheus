The family tree was chainsawed Wednesday week  
So now I have to mingle with the meek  
Hey mister, you have finally met your match  
Now everybody wants to kiss my snatch  
  
To go where God knows who has gone before  
I am a muse, not a mistress, not a whore  
Oh, suburban shits who want some class  
All queue up to kiss my ass  
  
And I was only trying to please  
I never got any royalties oh no, not me  
I'm still sliding through life on charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
If Marianne was born a man she'd show you all  
A way to piss your life against the wall  
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs  
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?  
  
Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?  
I had to know how far was going too far  
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand  
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me  
  
Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?  
She's just captivated by my charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
Sliding  
Sliding  
Never  
  
I wonder why the schools don't teach anything useful nowadays  
Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal  
I never asked to be on in the first place  
  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm
