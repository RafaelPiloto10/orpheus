When mommy's around we're the cutest little darlings, polite...  
We're squeaky clean  
We do the chores in the house, as quiet as a mouse  
Better kids you've never seen  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
As soon as mom leaves for work  
Out come the paint cans, start to spray it on the wall  
That's getting boring  
Go get the bats  
Gonna have us some indoor ball  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
Well, Randy's up to bat.  
Gonna hit me a home run  
Sorry 'bout that  
Outside, ball one  
We lost our ball, let's have some fun with the dishes  
Oops, we ain't doin' too well  
When mommy gets home, she won't blame it on us  
She knows that we're really swell  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels
