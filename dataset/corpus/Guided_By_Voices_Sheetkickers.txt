Cover your eyes, the light is too bright  
Your wisemen, they tell you lies  
And what's worse - they curse  
But still I love the bite  
Like flies or maybe mothmen  
As they're attracted to the light - they realize  
The night has come to baptize  
And they will finally realize  
And what's worse - it hurts  
But still they love the bite  
  
And I would like to die with you  
I'd like to try but I'm not suicide  
And I would like to kill you  
But that would suit you fine, I realize  
And I will not disgrace myself  
By chasing you around to pull you back  
And I will not give in an inch  
You win before the fight begins  
But it's o.k. I'm over you  
  
I'm over you  
I'm over you  
I'm over you  
  
Cover your eyes  
The light is too bright
