Did you see me coming?  
Was I that obvious?  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
  
You don't have be in "Who's Who" to know what's what  
You don't have to be a high-flyer to catch your slot  
The night we met was cold and wet  
I needed a drink or two  
I saw you standing there and I knew  
I'd love to be loved by you  
  
Did you see me coming?  
Was I that obvious?  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
  
You don't have to be what's what to know who's who  
You don't need the DNA to find the proof  
Then and there my life made sense  
You were the evidence  
  
Did you see me coming?  
Was I that obvious?  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
Did you see me coming?  
I thought I'd have to make  
All of the running  
I was all yours to take  
  
Am I superstitious or really religious  
Just "to thyself be true"  
But now I think I'm starting to believe in fate  
Because it delivered you  
  
Did you see me coming?  
Was I that obvious?  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
Did you see me coming?  
I thought I'd have to make  
All of the running  
I was all yours to take
