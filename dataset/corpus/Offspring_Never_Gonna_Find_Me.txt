On a mission started by my own admission  
I will leave you all behind  
By direction I'll create my own protection  
The real me you'll never find  
  
Aspirations turn to fear and desperation  
Nothing's ever good enough for you  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
You'll only see what I want you to  
  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside there is a real me  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll see  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside they haven't found me yet  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll get  
  
On a mission to establish my attrition  
You may think that you have won  
Your rejection has brought on my introspection  
I'll escape I'll only run  
  
Accusations may destroy my motivation  
I can feel it when you're pushing me  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
Only I know which me you'll see  
  
Break away!  
Run!  
Down inside!  
I've got to!  
Push it way!  
Down!  
I did not choose this!  
  
I don't really know  
What I want to say  
I can't afford the throw  
Can't make it go away  
Try to make it through  
Fuck your decision  
I can't feel myself  
But I'm burning up now!  
  
Never gonna find me
