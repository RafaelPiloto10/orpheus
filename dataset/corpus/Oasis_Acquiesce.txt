I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive  
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside  
I only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes  
  
I hope that I can say the things I wish I'd said  
To sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed  
You want to be alone when we could be alive instead  
  
Because we need each other  
We believe in one another  
And I know we're goin' to uncover  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
Because we need each other  
We believe in one another  
I know we're goin' to uncover  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
  
There are many things that I would like to know  
And there are many places that I wish to go  
But everything's dependin' on the way the wind may blow  
  
I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive  
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside  
I only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes  
  
Because we need each other  
We believe in one another  
And I know we're goin' to uncover  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
Because we need each other  
We believe in one another  
And I know we're goin' to uncover  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
What's sleepin' in our soul  
  
'Cause we believe  
'Cause we believe  
Yeah, we believe  
'Cause we believe  
'Cause we believe  
'Cause we believe  
Because we need  
Because we need
