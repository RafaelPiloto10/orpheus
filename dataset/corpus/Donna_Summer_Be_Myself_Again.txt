Let me introduce myself  
I'm a woman that you've never seen  
You might know me from somewhere else  
As someone that I've never been.  
  
I gave everything to play the game  
My soul fell apart at the seams  
I fell down like a house of cards  
When somebody pulled the queen.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you could spend your life  
Lookin' for your own reflection  
Time could blur the lines  
Between what's real and what's projected  
Had I known what I lost?  
What I gained, what it'd cost  
I'd still give what remains  
To be myself again.  
  
You must believe me when I say  
Don't live someone else's design  
Turn it around like a photograph  
The writings been there all the time.  
  
Now you can have all these hopes and dreams  
The ones I can't use anymore  
I don't know what it is you lost  
But I hope you got what you came for.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I want to leave right now  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
I want to let it all hang out  
But I don't want to let you down.  
  
Sometimes I want to just lay here  
Sometimes I want to disappear  
I want to show you all my fear  
But I don't want to let you down.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be myself again...
