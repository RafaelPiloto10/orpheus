Guess it's just the same old story  
Fool I didn't have a chance  
She took me like a house that's burning  
Never gave a second glance  
Eat 'em up let 'em go and you never  
Let your feelings show  
She ain't here and you're asking why  
Life's a bitch and then you die  
Come on lover just let go  
  
Is there something I should know  
Was it just one of those nights  
Something you don't remember, yeah  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
Sitting at the bar drinking beer  
Happy hour's over and love's cost me dear  
The piano player sits at his stool  
He's playing "Feelings" ain't' life cruel  
Uptown downtown life's a river  
And I wish I could drown  
  
I could still hear those loving sighs  
A lesson learnt love's just a lie  
I know I made a big mistake  
With love there's no even break  
There's a price you have to pay  
I got the bill when I heard you say  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember  
  
Was it just one of those nights, baby  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember
