We sit in the car outside your house  
I can feel the heat coming 'round  
I go to put my arm around you  
And you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds  
Well you let out one of your bored sighs  
Well lately when I look into your eyes  
I'm goin down  
  
We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night  
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight  
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up  
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down  
  
I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt  
I remember back when we started  
My kisses used to turn you inside out  
I used to drive you to work in the morning  
Friday night I'd drive you all around  
You used to love to drive me wild  
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down
