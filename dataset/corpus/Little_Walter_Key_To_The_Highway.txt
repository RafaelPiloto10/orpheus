I've got the key to the highway,  
Billed out and bound to go.  
I'm gonna leave here running,  
Because, walkin is most too slow.  
  
I'm goin back to the border,  
Where I'm better known.  
Because, you haven't done nothin,  
But, drove a good man away from home.  
  
Give me one more kiss, mama,  
Just before I go.  
I'm gonna leave this town,  
Girl, I won't be back no more.  
  
When the moon peep over the mountain,  
Honey, I'll be on my way.  
I'm gonna roam this highway,  
Until the break of day.  
  
Well, it's so long, so long baby,  
I'm gonna say goodbye.  
I'm gonna roam this highway,  
Until the day I die.
