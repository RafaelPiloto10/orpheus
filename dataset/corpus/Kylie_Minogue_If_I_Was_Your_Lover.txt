You take a piece of me every time you leave  
And never realize the way I feel about you  
But my tongue gets tied and my mouth gets dry  
I wanna tell you but I don't know how to  
  
So every night I dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe  
That someday you'll be mine (I know)  
We'll live in ectascy - the world for you and me  
  
One love - one life  
Everything would be alright if I was your lover  
One soul - one mind  
Everything could be so right if I was your lover  
  
Another day goes by and I'd lose my mind  
If I didn't know that you were meant for me  
Under moonlit night, when the time is right  
You'll hold me in your arms from then on to infinity  
  
And every night I'll dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe  
So happy that you're mine (I know)  
We'll live in ectascy - the world for you and me  
  
One love - one life  
Everything would be alright if I was your lover  
One soul - one mind  
Everything could be so right if I was your lover
