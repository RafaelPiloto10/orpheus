Tell me now  
Or are you teasing?  
I felt the cold hard facts of life  
Five degrees from freezing  
Does it amuse you to always  
Hurt me so?  
It try my best it's not enough  
Should I give up and let you?  
  
What more is there to take from me?  
There's nothing else to give you, dear  
There's nothing more that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade  
From purple to violet  
It will fade  
Just as the day dissolves into twilight  
  
Tell me now  
Or am I only dreaming?  
You said that you'd be mine for life  
And now you say you're leaving  
If I could hold you once more  
Before you go  
When I approach you just lash out  
Should I give up and let you?  
  
What more is there to take from me?  
There's nothing left give you, dear  
There's nothing else that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade from purple to violet  
It will fade...  
She's pulling out the pin
