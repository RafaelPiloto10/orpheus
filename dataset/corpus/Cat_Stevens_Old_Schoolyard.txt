Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
  
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had imaginings and we had  
All kinds of things and we laughed  
And needed love... Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had simplicity and we had  
Warm toast for tea and we laughed  
And needed love.. Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you  
  
You were my sweet love, my first sweet love  
My lovey dove, my love lovey dove  
No matter what place, whichever the place  
I still see your face, your smiling face  
In childish dreams, inside my dreams  
Like king and queen, God save our dreams  
N'though time may face, though time may fade  
It ain't never too late, to learn about love  
Learn about love  
  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had imaginings and we had  
All kinds of things and we laughed  
And needed love... Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you
