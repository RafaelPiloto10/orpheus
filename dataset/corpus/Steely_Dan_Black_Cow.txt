In the corner  
Of my eye  
I saw you in Rudy's  
You were very high  
You were high  
It was a cryin' disgrace  
They saw your face  
  
On the counter  
By your keys  
Was a book of numbers  
And your remedies  
One of these  
Surely will screen out the sorrow  
But where are you tomorrow  
  
I can't cry anymore  
While you run around  
Break away  
Just when it  
Seems so clear  
That it's  
Over now  
Drink your big black cow  
And get out of here  
  
Down to Greene Street  
There you go  
Lookin' so outrageous  
And they tell you so  
You should know  
How all the pros play the game  
You change your name  
  
Like a gangster  
On the run  
You will stagger homeward  
To your precious one  
I'm the one  
Who must make everything right  
Talk it out till daylight  
  
I don't care anymore  
Why you run around  
Break away  
Just when it  
Seems so clear  
That it's  
Over now  
Drink your big black cow  
And get out of here
