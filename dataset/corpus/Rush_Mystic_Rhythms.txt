So many things I think about  
When I look far away  
Things I know -- things I wonder  
Things I'd like to say  
The more we think we know about  
The greater the unknown  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are not alone  
  
Mystic rhythms -- capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Mysteries of night escape the light of day  
Mystic rhythms -- under northern lights  
Primitive things stir  
The hearts of everyone  
  
We sometimes catch a window  
A glimpse of what's beyond  
Was it just imagination  
Stringing us along?  
More things than are dreamed about  
Unseen and unexplained  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are entertained  
  
Mystic rhythms -- capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Nature seems to spin  
A supernatural way  
Mystic rhythms -- under city lights  
Or a canopy of stars  
We feel the powers  
And we wonder what they are  
We feel the push and pull  
Of restless rhythms from afar
