Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Many come to try to tear away your heart  
Never carin' for you from the very start  
Still you wonder if this time could be real  
Tryin' to figure out if they came just to steal  
  
Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Time and time again you've listened to a smile  
Never knowin' what's behind it all the while  
You give yourself away until love is gone  
And don't consider that they might be doin' harm  
  
Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Hey there, you let him wipe away that little tear  
You tryin so hard to hold back what you really feel  
Always look inside the people that your with  
And never hang around those who can not give
