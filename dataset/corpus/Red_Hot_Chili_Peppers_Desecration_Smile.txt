All alone, not by myself,  
Another girl bad for my health  
Seen it all through someone else and I,  
(Another girl bad for my heath)  
  
Celebrated but undisturbed,  
And serenaded by the terror bird  
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, I'm  
(Serenaded by the terror bird)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
Disintegrated by the rising sun  
A rolling black out of oblivion  
And I'd like to think that I'm your number one  
(I'm rolling black out of oblivion)  
  
I wanna leave but I just get stuck  
A broken record runnin' low on luck  
There's heavy metal coming from your truck  
And I'm (a broken record running low on luck)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise  
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys  
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed  
We could all go down  
  
I love the feeling when it falls apart  
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and  
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark  
And I'm (slow to finish but I'm quick to start)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
Yeah...
