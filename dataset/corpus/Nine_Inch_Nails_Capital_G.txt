I pushed the button and elected him to office, and  
He pushed the button, and he dropped the bomb  
You pushed the button, and could watch it on the television  
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long  
  
I'm sick of hearing 'bout the have and have-not's  
Have some personal accountability  
The biggest problem with the way that we are doing things is  
The more we let you have, the less that I'll be keeping for me  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala  
Don't really see what all the fuss is about  
Ain't gonna worry about no future generations  
And I'm sure somebody's gonna figure it out  
  
Don't try to tell me that some power can corrupt a person  
You haven't had enough to know what it's like  
You're only angry 'cause you wish you were in my position  
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, all right!  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
There's a lot of me inside you  
Maybe you're afraid to see  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
There's a lot of me inside you  
Maybe you're afraid to see  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G
