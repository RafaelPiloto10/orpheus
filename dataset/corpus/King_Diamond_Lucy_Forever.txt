I leave it up me me girl, You tell me when and I'll act  
  
By the first light of dawn, Daddy will be on his way  
By the first light of dawn, No more Daddy, I say  
  
I leave it up to me girl  
You tell me when and I'll make him disappear  
  
I can feel... the sun will soon be here  
Get away from that string my dear  
What do you think you're doing Lucy  
  
Too late, I should have seen it coming my way  
Glass from the broken window, oh so high above  
Heading straight for my neck  
  
By the first light of dawn, my body lost its head  
By the first light of dawn, Oh God... I'm dead  
  
I feel... my soul is, creeping... up into my brain  
  
I guess I would be scared, if I weren't already dead  
But my blackened heart has told me  
No one really cares anyway  
Lucy, what are you doing now, do not set him free girl  
Lucy, what are you doing now  
You better take a listen to my head  
Did you hear what it said  
  
The view is so very strange, so strange from here  
Facing the floor is hard, when you're nothing but a ball  
How could the mayor win, and I become one of THEM  
I'm just a head on the floor  
My body is over there, but I am still right here  
  
Lucy... come back to me  
Lucy... you cannot leave me like this  
  
Lucy, I hear your little feet coming my way  
Pick me up and let us head for home  
But not a word to Daddy  
So she puts me in her backpack  
  
Lucy forever, I'll be with Lucy forever  
Lucy forever, I'll be with Lucy forever  
Lucy forever, I'll be with Lucy forever  
Lucy forever, I'll be with Lucy forever  
Ever... ever... ever... ever... ever... ever
