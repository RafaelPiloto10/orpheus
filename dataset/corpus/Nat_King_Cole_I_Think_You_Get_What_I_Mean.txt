My grammar ain't so good  
And I've got no Ph.D  
But there's more important things  
Than a college degree  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
There are ways to keep her happy  
Ways to lose a tune  
I don't take advice of no one  
I know just what to do  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
You give her lots of kisses  
And dine her with good food  
Work to keep her cheerful  
And in a loving mood  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
There're times when she'll stay out late  
And you'll be feeling blue  
Go on out and have a ball, son  
She'll come running back to you  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Have yourself a ball  
I think you get what I mean
