Standing in the darkness  
Waiting for the light  
The smell of pure adrenaline  
Burning in the night  
  
Random blinding flashes  
Aiming at the stage  
Intro tape begins to roll  
Igniting sonic rage  
  
Still they keep me between these hollow walls  
Hoping to find in me  
The answers to the test that stumped them all  
  
"The boy is just simply crazy  
Suffering from delusions  
We honestly think that maybe  
He might need an institution  
  
He lives in a world of fiction  
And really could use some help  
We have just the place to fix him  
To save him from himself"  
  
Curled up in the darkness  
Searching of the light  
The smell of sweat and shit  
Steaming through the night  
  
Random urine testing  
Pills red, pink and blue  
Counseling and therapy  
Providing not a clue  
  
Still they keep me between these hollow walls  
Hoping to find in me  
The answers to the test that stumped them all  
  
"We can't seem to find the answers  
He seemed such a clear cut case  
We cannot just let him leave here  
And put all this work to waste  
  
Why don't we try shock treatment  
It really might do some help  
We have just the tools to fix him  
To save him from himself"
