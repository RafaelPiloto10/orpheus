Splashdown in the silver screen  
Into a deep dramatic scene  
I swim through the theater  
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer  
Like a kite in the bright midday  
Wonder stole my breath away  
  
Shy sonata for Mercury  
The stars always sing so pretty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
I made for the countryside  
  
And my eyes never grew so wide  
Apple, raspberry, river blue  
I don't wanna leave without you  
In the sound I'll gladly drown  
Into the emerald underground  
I rub my eyes 'cause it's hard to see  
  
Surrounded by all this beauty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
(I'm sad to see you go)  
(But I'd rather be alone)  
When tiger eyes begin making you blush  
When diamonds boast that they can't be crushed  
Let 'em go 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured  
'Cause dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
I'll rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust
