Whenever I look out french windows  
It's always snowing outside.  
And feel your body relax on mine,  
Giving me all the good lines,  
(Uh-huh)  
All the good lines,  
All the good lines...  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
A crystal layer of ice on our skin:  
Very numb outside but warm within.  
I bend to join our lips, but it's too cold  
To kiss and hit. Is it you I'm feeling?  
Is it you I'm feeling?  
(Yeah)  
Is it you I'm feeling?  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.
