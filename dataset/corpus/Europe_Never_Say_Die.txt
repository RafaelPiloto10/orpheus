Oh who took that shot  
Well I couldn't say, I was already down  
Oh who set me up  
Well I couldn't say cause I saw no one around  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation  
I had it all worked out  
Everything I hear is consolation  
I've got this feelin' you should never say die  
  
In my fantasy  
There were days to come that I wanted so bad  
Someone sold me out then it all was done  
That dream was all that I had  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...  
  
Oh who took that shot...  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...
