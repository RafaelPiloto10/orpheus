I wonder why you threw your diary away  
When you walk by I nearly died What can I say  
Things were fine, you were mine just yesterday  
Now we're apart ,Breakin' up is breakin' my heart  
  
I find myself alone at night And then I cry  
No tenderness My happiness just said goodbye  
Now you're gone, I'm alone I wonder why we had to part  
  
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart, baby  
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart  
  
The love affair we used to share Is cold and still  
I loved you then I love you now I always will  
The day that you found someone new  
My lonely world just fell apart  
Out of your arms drives me out of my mind  
  
Baby, breaking up is breakin' my heart  
Baby, breaking up is breakin' my heart  
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart  
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart
