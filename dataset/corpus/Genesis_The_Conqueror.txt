He climbs inside the looking glass  
And points at everything he hates  
He calls to you hey look out son  
That's a gun they're pointing at your pretty face  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
Five hundred little women are calling at their hero's door  
Yes their hero's working overtime  
He's squirming on an empty floor  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
He's brought the castle on the hill  
He's brought it just to knock it down  
The local power shout him down  
They say he's just an empty headed clown  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
He's busy building monuments  
To hide inside his empty grave  
You there can you find some friend  
He's looking for some people to save  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the words of love are killing him  
And the conqueror is on his way  
And the words of love were lying on an empty floor  
Just in the place where the conqueror lay
