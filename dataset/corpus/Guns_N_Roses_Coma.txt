See you've caught me in a coma  
And I don't think I want to  
Ever come back to this  
World again  
Kinda like it in a coma  
'Cause no one's ever gonna  
Oh make me come back to this  
World again  
  
Now I feel as if I'm floating away  
I can't feel the pressure  
And I like it this way  
But my body's calling, my body's calling  
Want me to come back to this  
World again  
  
Suspended deep in a sea of black  
I got the light at the end  
I got the bones on the mast  
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing  
I could leave so easily  
My friends are calling back to me  
I said yeah,  
They're leaving it all up to me when  
All I needed was clarity  
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on  
Goddammit  
  
Slippin' farther and farther away  
It's a miracle how long we can stay  
In a world our minds created  
In a world that's full of shit  
  
Please understand me  
I'm climbin' through the wreckage  
Of all my twisted dreams  
And this cheap investigation  
Just can't stifle all my screams  
And I'm waiting  
At the crossroads  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
Where are you  
  
No one's gonna bother me anymore  
No one's gonna mess with my head no more  
I can't understand what all the fightin's for  
But it's so nice here down off the shore  
I wish you could see this  
Cause there's nothing to see  
It's peaceful here and its fine with me  
Not like the world where I used to live  
I never really wanted to live...  
  
Zap him again...  
Zap the son of a bitch again  
  
Live your life like it's a coma  
Won't you tell me why we'd want to  
With all the reasons you give  
It's kinda hard to believe  
  
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason  
Why you should stay  
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway  
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride  
Got a one way ticket to your suicide  
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  
  
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold  
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old  
But if home is where the heart is  
Then there's stories to be told  
No, you don't need a doctor  
No one else can heal your soul  
  
Got your mind in submission  
Got your life on the line  
But nobody pulled the trigger  
They just stepped aside  
They'll be down by the water  
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  
  
They'll be callin' in the morning  
They'll be hanging on the phone  
They'll be waitin' for an answer  
But you know nobody's home  
And when the bells stop ringing  
It was nobody's fault but your own  
  
There were always ample warning  
There were always subtle signs  
And you would have seen them coming  
But we gave you too much time  
And when you said that no one's listening  
Why'd your best friend drop a dime  
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  
Way to spend our time  
  
And it's so easy to be social  
It's so easy to be cool  
Yeah, its easy to get hungry  
When you ain't got shit to lose  
And I wish that I could help you  
With what you hope to find  
But I'm still out here waiting  
Watching reruns of my life  
When you reach the point of breaking  
Know it's gonna take some time  
To heal those broken memories  
That another man would need  
Just to survive
