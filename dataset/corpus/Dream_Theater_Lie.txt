Daybreak  
At the bottom of lake  
It's a hundred degrees a I can't breath  
And I won't get out  
'til I figure it out  
Thought I'm weak like I can't believe  
So you tell me "trust me" I can trust you  
Just let me show you  
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt  
Cause I don't know if I know you  
  
Doing fine, but don't waste me time  
Tell me what it is you want to say  
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry  
I've been out in the rain all day  
So you tell me "trust you" I can trust you  
As far as I can throw you  
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt  
'cause I don't know if I know you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't tell me you wanted me  
Don't tell me you thought of me  
I won't, I swear I won't  
(did)  
I'll try, I swear I'll try  
(lie)  
  
Mother Mary quite contrary  
Kiss the boys and make them wary  
Things are getting just a little bit scary  
It's a wonder I can still breath  
Never been much of a doubting thomas  
But nothing breaks like a broken promise  
You tell me 'bout your two more coming  
But once is just enough for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed  
She comes in apparently to fill the void  
All dogs need a leash and  
At least I'll forget it  
And she would never hurt me though she's never said it  
But I'm not gonna ask her today  
I don't want to scare her away  
Oh, Your, town, I'm all alone  
And I, just can't, stare at the phone  
I want to talk about lifelong mistakes  
And you can tell your stepfather I said so  
  
[Chorus]
