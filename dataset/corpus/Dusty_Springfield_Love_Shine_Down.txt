Ooh, hoo, once love was a fire  
That came and lit my way  
I felt the fire die about a month ago  
And now I look at my man  
And I know he's goin' away  
And now, I want that man  
Mmm, I need that man  
And I got to get back into his heart  
I said love shine down on me  
Love shine down on me  
Love shine, light my way back into his heart  
I, I stood beside him  
When nobody else, nobody wanted to  
Well I've been down, yes I have  
But I've never, never been broken  
'Til the day that he told me  
The sweet lovin' life was through  
I said, I want that man  
Ooh, I need that man  
And I got to get back into his heart  
I said love shine down on me  
Love shine down on me  
Love shine, light my way back into his  
Love shine  
Oh, love shine  
I said shine, shine, shine  
Oh, down on me  
I want it, yes, I need it  
Oh, ho, oh, ho  
I said love shine down on me  
Love shine, light my way back into
