I know, my baby told me so  
Yes, I know, my baby told me so  
She said I'm leavin' you, daddy  
Got such a long way to go  
  
Well, I can hear your phone ringin', baby all down that line  
Yes I can hear your phone ringin', baby all down that line  
And when I hear your phone ringin'  
I know you're not far behind  
  
Fanny Mae, baby won't you please come home  
Now I'm so tired livin' all alone
