I ain't missing you  
Don't care what you do  
You're the one who left me  
Crying sad and lonely  
  
I ain't missing you  
  
What we had is through  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
  
Call me on the phone thinkin' that I'd be home  
  
It's as if you feel that I have no life without you  
  
But I got news for you baby I'm moving on  
  
I ain't singing no sad song yeah yeah  
  
Na na na na na na  
  
Na na na na na na  
  
Na na na na na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, hey  
  
'cause I ain't missing you  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I guess you never thought someone could take your palce  
  
Love me better and kiss all the hurt you gave away  
  
Never been happier baby since you've been gone  
  
I ain't singing no sad song, eh  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, hey  
  
'cause I ain't missing you  
  
Repeat 1  
  
All the things you put me through  
  
Couldn't be made up in a lifetime  
  
Had to step back and find myself  
  
Now I know, I know how to love so much better  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I ain't missing you  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
  
What we had was through  
  
Na na na na na na  
  
You're the one who left me  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
  
Sad and crying  
  
Repeat above while:  
  
You thought that when you left me  
  
I'd be missing you but it isn't true  
  
You thought that when you left me  
  
I'd be missing you but it isn't true
