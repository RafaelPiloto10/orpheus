A brand new meaning  
For what's goin' on today  
I felt it comin'  
Thought I'd pass it on your way  
In case your head's in the mighty fog  
There's a thought, a show in the dark, I say  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
  
Pass it on, a sure thing, baby  
  
Good things coming  
If you care to wait your turn  
Heart's desire  
With enough here left to burn  
Because the love's all around you see  
If you're lovin' you will receive, I say  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
  
A sure thing, baby  
Make it feel good tonight  
Make it feel real good  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Well, well, well, well  
  
Just imagine havin' to know it all  
No more guessin'  
'cause your left hand's in the thought  
Consult me when you need a friend  
Pass it on and you're feelin' lost, well  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on
