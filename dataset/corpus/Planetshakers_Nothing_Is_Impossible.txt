[Chorus]  
Through You I can do anything  
I can do all things  
'Cause it's You who gives me strength  
Nothing is impossible  
Through You blind eyes are open  
Strongholds are broken  
I am living by faith  
Nothing is impossible  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm not gonna live by what I see  
I'm not gonna live by what I feel  
Deep down I know that You're here with me  
And I know that You can do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
Through You I can do anything  
I can do all things  
'Cause it's You who gives me strength  
Nothing is impossible  
Through You blind eyes are open  
Strongholds are broken  
I am living by faith  
Nothing is impossible  
  
Nothing is impossible  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm not gonna live by what I see  
I'm not gonna live by what I feel  
Deep down I know that You're here with me  
And I know that You can do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
Through You I can do anything  
I can do all things  
'Cause it's You who gives me strength  
Nothing is impossible  
Through You blind eyes are open  
Strongholds are broken  
I am living by faith  
Nothing is impossible  
  
Nothing is impossible  
  
[Bridge]  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Through You I can do anything  
I can do all things  
'Cause it's You who gives me strength  
Nothing is impossible  
Through You blind eyes are open  
Strongholds are broken  
I am living by faith  
Nothing is impossible  
  
[Outro]  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe in you
