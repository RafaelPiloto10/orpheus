Call the boys and tell them  
Say I won't be there  
You can tell them  
I'm not going anywhere  
Yesterday was dreaming  
But my dream came tumbling down  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
Say I won't be there  
If you see my darling  
Out there in the crowd  
Say I still remember  
Promises we vowed  
Yesterday was dreaming  
But my dream came tumbling down  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
Say I won't be there  
Bring me back my darling  
Be my friend for life  
I don't want no new lover  
I just want a true lover  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
I won't spoil their fun  
Everyone there dancing  
But I'm the lonely one  
Yesterday was dreaming  
But my dream came tumbling down  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
Say I won't be there  
Bring me back my darling  
Be my friend for life  
Oh, I don't want no new lover  
I just want a true lover  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
I won't spoil their fun  
Everyone there dancing  
But I'm the lonely one  
Yesterday was dreaming  
But my dream came tumbling down  
  
Call the boys and tell them  
Say I won't be there  
I won't be there
