Girl make a list  
Go out and find yourself a new plaything  
Oh girl you need a trip  
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain  
  
So just remember how he would tell you lies  
And then pretend that everything was so sweet  
No need to sacrifice  
If you're not satisfied  
He's just a canine running round on heat  
  
Girl, you must resist  
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart  
Oh girl you must insist  
You've got to stop the fool before he starts  
  
So just remember how he was so untrue  
And all the tacky things he did to you  
No need to sympathise  
'Cause he's not worth the time  
You've got to find someone who's true to you  
  
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad  
Girlfriend, you know you're the best he's ever had  
Girlfriend
