So I think you are a fool  
Hanging on my every word  
It's getting ugly  
So I'm ugly  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
So I thought you disappeared  
Being alone is what you fear  
Are you lonely?  
Yes lonely  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping, revolting  
All that shit that's who you are  
Hoping, and scolding, revolving  
Peel it back, reveal the scar  
Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
The time is coming  
God is saying  
You're really happy  
What a game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and you're to blame  
The time is coming  
You've gone insane  
You're feeling happy  
You've won the game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and you're to blame  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping, revolting  
All that shit that's who you are  
Hoping, and scolding, revolving  
Peel it back, reveal the scar  
Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping, revolting  
All that shit that's who you are  
Hoping, and scolding, revolving  
Peel it back, reveal the scar  
Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are
