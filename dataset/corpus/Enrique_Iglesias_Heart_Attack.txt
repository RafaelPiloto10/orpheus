Loving you was easy  
Thought you'd never leave me yeah, yeah  
Wrapped around my finger  
See ya when I see you yeah, yeah  
  
Now I'm hearing around  
That you been running around  
I didn't think I'd miss you  
Now I'm feeling like a fool  
Ooh, ooh  
  
It hit me like a heart attack  
When you finally left me girl  
I thought I'd never want you back  
But I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
  
Never really noticed  
All the little things you did, you did  
Never bought you roses  
Always was around my friends, my friends  
  
And now I'm hearing around  
That you been running around  
I didn't think I'd miss you  
Now I'm feeling like a fool  
Ooh, ooh  
  
It hit me like a heart attack  
When you finally left me girl  
I thought I'd never want you back  
But I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
  
Never should've let you slip away  
Living in a world that's turned to grey  
Little did I know it hurts so bad  
  
'Cause it hit me like a heart attack  
When you finally left me girl  
I thought I'd never want you back  
But I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
I don't wanna live in a world without you, no oh  
I don't wanna live in a world without you, no oh  
I don't wanna live in a world without you  
  
And now I'm hearing around  
That you been running around  
I didn't think I'd miss you  
Now I'm feeling like a fool  
Ooh ooh
