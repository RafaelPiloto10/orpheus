Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To change my night to day  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To chase my blues away.  
  
Well, I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure.  
  
And I'm in no position to barter  
And I'm in no condition to play the martyr  
And I'm sadder certainly  
But I'm smarter  
And I find myself.  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To share my empty bed  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To soothe my aching head.  
  
Well, I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure.  
  
And my feelings have grown  
Rigid like a wooden post.  
And my love is like a curtain  
That has been drawn closed  
And my life just isn't going  
The way I thought it was supposed to  
And I'm crying and I find myself.  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To change my night to day.
