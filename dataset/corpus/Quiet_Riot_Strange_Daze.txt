[Verse 1:]  
Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a day  
Twisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing something?s going to
break.  
Deliver me it will deliver you, faceless masses of grey and blue  
The sky is falling a rain of blood  
The soul?s are empty above  
  
[Chorus:]  
Strange Daze- it?s hard to accept  
Strange ways- you never expect  
Strange daze-Nothing makes sense  
Strange Daze trying to make sense of it all  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Loss of balance with an axe to grind  
People talking with nothing really on their minds  
No provocation, no sparks to the flame  
Investigations with nothing left say  
Remember me, I won?t remember you  
Dogs are howling over what you do  
Skin is crawling you embrace your self I?m not feeling too well
