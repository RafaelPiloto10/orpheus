The friendly ranger paused  
And scooping a bowl of beans  
Spreading them like stars  
Falling like justice on different scenes  
  
"I'm damned"  
"indeed, comrade"  
"I'm being bombed"  
And all the people's faces turned strawberry blonde  
  
By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits  
For the sun making sure it's not late  
"just in time" "no need to fear" "well, just in case"  
And all the people are happy for another year  
  
And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun  
Getting it's glow  
He goes on  
Singing this song  
  
To feel the goodness glowing inside  
To walk down a street with my arms about your hips, side by side  
To play with a sad eyed child till he smiles  
To look at a starry sky at night, realize the miles  
  
To see the sun set behind the steeple  
Clontarf castle, no king, queen or knightly people  
A coal fire and it's pouring rain  
To wave goodbye to a very good friend, never meet again  
Little thoughts bring little memories of you to me
