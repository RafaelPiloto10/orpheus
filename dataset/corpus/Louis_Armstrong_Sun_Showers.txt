Sun showers  
It might rain  
Sun will shine again  
So sun showers  
  
In a little while  
The sky above will smile  
Like laughter  
That follows your tears  
  
Dark clouds of sorrow  
Will soon be a sunny tomorrow  
While sunflowers raise their little eyes  
Up to the flamin' skies  
  
And sun showers  
Leave as they bud  
A rainbow in our hearts  
  
The great skies soon will be clear  
My dear, those sun showers  
I'm all here
