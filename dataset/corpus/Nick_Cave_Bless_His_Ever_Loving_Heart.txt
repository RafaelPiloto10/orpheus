Bless his ever loving heart  
Only he knows who you are  
He may seem so very far  
Bless his ever loving heart  
  
And when you're feeling sad  
And everywhere you look you can't believe the things you see  
When it all comes down so bad  
And beauty lies exhausted in the streets  
  
Hold his ever loving hand  
Even when you do not understand  
Sorrow has it's natural end  
Hold his ever loving hand  
  
And when you're feeling low  
And everyone you meet you can't believe the things they say  
When there's no place left to go  
Where someone isn't moving you a little further down the way  
  
Bless his ever loving heart  
What you do is what you are  
When it all comes down so hard  
Bless his ever loving heart  
Hold his ever loving hand  
When it seems you ain't got a friend  
  
Only he knows who you are and what you are  
Bless his ever loving heart  
Bless his ever loving heart
