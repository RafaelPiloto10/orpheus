If I live a thousand years or more  
You'll still be the one I'm living for  
And every night I whisper a prayer  
That every day of my life you will always be there  
I can't stop the world from changing  
I can't say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
About you, baby  
If I only have one life to live  
I will give you all I have to give  
So don't believe these are faithless times  
'Cause as long as I live, you will always be mine  
I can't stop the world from changing  
I can't say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I can't stop the world from changing  
I can't say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
About you, baby  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way that I feel  
I won't change the way I feel  
About you, baby  
I won't change the way that I feel  
About you, baby
