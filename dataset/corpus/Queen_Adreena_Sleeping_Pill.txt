Oh so, my love  
This sleeping pill  
Will watch you through the night  
And come dawn  
I'll be long, long gone  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
We feed upon the broken branch  
We kiss the stars goodbye  
For the sun can't fight this overcast  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
The spider's web  
It can't break our fall  
I whisper to the sky  
I pray she takes you in her arms  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
I.. Tried..  
Storm warning in the sand  
She evaporates beneath my fingernails  
The road is lost underwater  
She's running down a river with eels  
She is lost to me.
