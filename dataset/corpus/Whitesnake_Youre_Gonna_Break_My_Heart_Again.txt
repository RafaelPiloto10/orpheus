Now I know  
I've seen that look  
On your face before  
When you realized  
All the memories  
Walked right out the door..  
  
Now it's eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
No more hiding behind the truth  
I'm gonna get exactly  
What's coming to me  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
  
Now you say  
I took advantage of you  
When you never knew the score  
But, you should know  
We've been this way  
One thousand times before  
  
You told me once,  
You told me twice  
It's down to me, girl  
To pay the price  
But, this time's the last time  
That's for sure.  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
Yes you are  
  
You talk of how our love  
Was meant to be  
And all the time  
You sacrificed for me.  
  
So how could I forget it,  
Why should I regret it  
'Cause when you told me you loved me  
I knew it was lies  
So no more crying, no more goodbyes,  
'Cause this time's the last time  
That's for sure break my heart.  
  
Now you say  
There is no one in the world  
Can get the better of you  
An' you should know  
'Cause you never made it easy  
With the pain you put me through  
  
I told you once  
I told you twice  
It's down to you, girl  
To pay the price  
'Cause this time's the last time  
That's for sure.  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
  
I just can't take anymore,  
No more, no more, no more
