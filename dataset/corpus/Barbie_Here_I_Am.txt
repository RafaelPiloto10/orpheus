[Verse 1]  
When I was young  
I played for fun  
Made up the words  
Nobody heard  
  
But now I see  
All eyes on me  
And suddenly  
I'm in a dream  
I got a feeling now  
Everything's right somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm stepping up  
Right to the top  
That's how I'm wired  
I take it higher  
  
I'm in control  
I broke the mould  
The girl you see  
Is up to me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]:  
I'm lifting off the ground  
Finding the perfect sound  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
Again, again and again and again  
  
Bridge:  
There's a star that's right inside you  
So come on and let it out  
  
Find out what you're about and just shout  
"Here I Am"  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
Here I am being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
Again, again  
Again and again and again  
Again and again and again  
Here we go
