Gonna kill and destroy  
I'm not an animal boy  
Why don't they understand  
I'm not an ape man  
  
Don't have brain damage  
I'm not an a wild savage  
Don't push me around  
Don't bring my head down  
  
I'm not an imbecile  
Don't treat me like an animal  
I'm not a creature in the zoo  
Don't tell me what to do  
  
You don't know what it's like  
You don't know how I feel  
I don't have a monkey's brain  
I'm not an animal  
  
You can't lock me in a cage  
This ain't the Stone Age  
Better get out of my way  
Someone's gonna have to pay  
  
Animal boy  
Animal boy  
Animal boy  
Animal boy
