Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like you might surrender  
To some dragon in your dreams  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like a pink donation  
To the dragon in your dreams  
  
I don't need your sweet devotion  
I don't want your cheap emotion  
Just whip me up some dragon lotion  
For your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like some tacky little pamphlet  
In your daddy's bottom drawer  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
I don't believe you've never seen  
His book before  
  
I don't need no consolation  
I don't want your reservation  
I only got one destination  
An' that's your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Just like your mama  
Make her fuzzy poodle do  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
The way your mama  
Make that nasty poodle chew  
  
I'll ignore your cheap aroma  
And your little-bo-peep diploma  
I'll just put you in a coma  
With some dirty love  
  
THE POODLE BITES!  
(Come on, Frenchie)  
THE POODLE CHEWS IT!  
(Snap it!)  
THE POODLE BITES!  
(Come on, Frenchie)  
THE POODLE CHEWS IT!  
(Snap it!)
