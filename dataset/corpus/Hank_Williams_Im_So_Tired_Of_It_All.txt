All my life I've been so lonesome  
If happiness came, I missed the call  
All my dreams have died and vanished  
And now, I'm so tired of it all  
In life and love, I've been a failure  
Too many tears through it all  
Too many broken vows and promises  
And now, I'm so tired of it all  
Everything I loved, I lost dear  
Too many times I've watched my castles fall  
My life is full of regretting  
And now, I'm so tired of it all  
From this world I'll soon be going  
No one will miss me, after all  
Up there, I pray I'll find contentment  
But now, I'm so tired of it all
