You live your life  
You go day by day  
Like nothing can go wrong  
These skies are made  
They're changing the game  
You learn to play it hard  
  
And I know you wish for more  
And I know you try  
And I hope you realize  
You know the time is right  
  
The whole world is watching when you rise  
The whole world is beating for you right now  
Your whole life is flashing before your eyes  
It's all in this moment that changes all  
  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
You and you rise.  
  
You build your walls  
Then break them away  
'Cause that is what it takes  
You saved yourself  
You found who you are  
And that never goes away  
  
And I know you wish for more  
And I know you try  
And I hope you realize  
You know the time is right  
  
The whole world is watching when you rise  
The whole world is beating for you right now  
Your whole life is flashing before your eyes  
It's all in this moment that changes all  
  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
Yeah, the whole world is watching  
You and you rise  
  
Your sacrifice comes through your mind  
But nothing is wasted  
You made it now  
You rise again, breaking out  
He said that you're taken you paid the price  
  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
You and you rise  
  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
Yeah, the whole world is watching  
You and you rise
