I see that nothin's safe  
Insist on playing games  
Some waste their time and more  
I am still popular  
Permission since you fix  
I got to gas -- get  
Or just another job  
Oh no surly not  
  
Your rude, but you're absolute  
Stalemate, ahh too late, too late  
  
I thought you were for real  
Just won the river deal  
Don't give me all that crap  
I just escaped your trap  
But didn't you see the joke  
Then you're just chasin' smoke  
You found another one  
An old story's done  
  
Your rude, but you're absolute  
Stalemate, ahh too late, too late  
  
Misunderstanding me  
The way you felt so free  
I'm gonna jump the gun  
I'm gonna cut an' run  
You're gonna do it see  
I've got no ice in me  
And now the thrill is gone  
An old story's done  
  
Your rude, but you're absolute  
Stalemate, ahh too late, too late
