Just one glance and I never had a chance  
There and then I knew I'd fall in love with you  
You should know that you had me at hello  
I was Juliet and you're my Romeo  
  
You're my super hero save me from this sorrow  
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away  
You are my Mcdreamy, you're my own Mcstreamy  
Brad Pitt and George Clooney don't stand a chance  
You're my one and only true romance  
  
Just one kiss you swept me off my feet  
And my heart was beating faster than it should  
Just one smile (Just one smile) and it's like a carpet ride  
I can hear the song a whole new world with you  
(A whole new world)  
  
You're my Bieber fever, yu're my Ashton Kutcher  
I'm going Lady Gaga (papa paparazzi) over you  
  
Ooh you are my Mcdreamy, you're my own Mcstreamy  
Brad Pitt and George Clooney don't stand a chance  
You're my one and only true romance  
  
I'll be yours forever and a day  
Our love is here to stay  
You are my one true romance  
  
Loving you is easy  
Though it might sound cheesy  
I'm a girl just standing in front of a boy  
Asking him to love her  
(When you say nothing at all)  
  
You're my super hero  
Save me from this sorrow  
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away  
(Fly me away)  
You're my one and only true romance  
(When I fall in love)
