Oh, oh, oh  
She don't impress me, not like she used to  
Everything that she don't do  
That's what I want, what I need  
Seeking rapidly, that's when you sailed through  
That's mean so way with you  
Everything that she won't do, you do for me  
  
Say what you say, we're floating away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came, yeah  
  
12 am she leaves, she don't say where to  
Won't see her again till 12 noon and she don't smile like me  
Suddenly I see why she don't do what she used to  
She found someone new, well baby me too, so sorry  
  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came, oh  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, way  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came  
  
Ohohoh...  
  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came  
  
Say what you say, oh, oh  
Say what you say, aaahh  
Say what you say
