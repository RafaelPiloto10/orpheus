Let go darlin'  
I can feel the night wind call  
Guess I'd better go  
I like you more than half as much  
As I love your Spanish moss  
  
Spanish moss hangin' down  
Lofty as the southern love we've found  
Spanish moss  
Keeps on followin' my thoughts around  
Georgia pine and Ripple wine  
Memories of Savannah summertime  
Spanish moss  
Wish you knew what I was sayin'  
  
So I'm rollin' north thinkin'  
Of the way things might have been  
If she and I could have changed it all somehow  
  
Spanish moss hangin' down  
Lofty as the sycamore you've found  
Spanish moss  
Keeps on followin' my thoughts around  
Georgia pine and Ripple wine  
Kisses mixed with moonshine and red clay  
Spanish moss  
Wish you knew what I was sayin'  
  
So I'm rollin' north thinkin'  
Of the way things might have been  
If she and I could have changed it all somehow  
  
Let go darlin'  
I can feel the night wind call  
The devil take the cost  
I like the way your kisses flow  
And I love your Spanish moss
