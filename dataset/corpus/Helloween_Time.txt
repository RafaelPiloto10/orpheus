Feel it running off  
So strong and clear  
An age is over fast  
And disappears  
Help him if you can  
His hour will come soon  
Push away his fear  
He'll see Elysium  
It's time  
It's time  
  
Guard him a little while  
And calm his shiver  
Wash and dry his tears  
And cold his fever  
Take the bibles words  
Speak it pure his soul  
Lay love in his mind  
His close to the final goal  
It's time  
It's time  
  
It's time to go  
Time for the freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Pray strong  
Pray to the higher  
Turn your back on the devil's fire  
Time to go  
Time for freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Time is passing by  
  
When his mind is clear  
He called your brother  
Now his brain is dazed  
It's resigning rather  
Mother take his hand  
Say a last good-bye  
We're not gifted to  
Turn water into wine  
It's time  
It's time  
  
It's time to go  
Time for the freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Pray strong  
Pray to the higher  
Turn your back on the devil's fire  
Time to go  
Time for freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Time is passing by
