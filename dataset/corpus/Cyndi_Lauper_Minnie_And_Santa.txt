Worked with a woman named Minnie  
One Christmas eve long ago  
When I asked "What you doing this evening ?"  
Minnie took on a seasonal glow  
She said she'd be waiting for Santa  
She'd be wearing a bright red bow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"  
  
Now Minnie could not be persuaded  
That Santa just did not exist  
She swore if she put up some mistletoe  
Santa did come give her a kiss  
And there where she'd hung up her stockings  
All in their silky, soft, sheen  
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug  
Where the cookies and milk could be seen  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"  
  
Now Minnie was older and wiser  
Like a dear old Auntie to me  
But the night that she ran off with Santa  
Was a real epiphany  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"  
  
Next Xmas I passed by the bakery  
Staring out from on top of a cake  
Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin  
And a gal in silk stockings and lace  
Oh, Minnie and Santa...
