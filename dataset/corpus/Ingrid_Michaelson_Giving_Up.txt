What if we stop having a ball?  
What if the paint chips from the wall?  
What if there's always cups in the sink?  
What if I'm not what you think I am?  
  
What if I fall further than you?  
What if you dream of somebody new?  
What if I never let you win, chase you with a rolling pin?  
Well what if I do?  
  
[Chorus]  
I am giving up on making passes and  
I am giving up on half empty glasses and  
I am giving up on greener grasses.  
I am giving up.  
  
What if our baby comes home after nine?  
What it your eyes close before mine?  
What if you lose yourself sometimes? Then I'll be the one to find you  
Safe in my heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am giving up.  
I am giving up.  
I am giving up on greener grasses.  
  
I am giving up for you.  
I am giving up for you.  
I am giving up.
