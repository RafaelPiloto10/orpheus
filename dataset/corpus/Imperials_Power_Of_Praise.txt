What can move a man to dance  
When he doesn't hear a band?  
What can move a broken heart to sing?  
What can make a weary sinner  
Fall down on his knees?  
What can make the halls of Heaven ring?  
What can lift my lowest thoughts  
To the very throne of God?  
And what can lift my eyes from earthly things?  
  
Chorus:  
It's the power of praise  
The power of praise  
When led by God's spirit,  
It's a mighty refrain  
It flows with a force  
That carries a current of change  
The power of praise  
  
Praise can give my soul a fire  
When my passion's been consumed  
Praise can give my spirit's song a voice  
Praise can fill my mind with peace  
When doubts have overcome  
Praise can fill my longing to rejoice  
Praise can turn my sorrow  
To a holy celebration  
Praise can turn my weeping  
Into tears of joy  
  
Chorus (2x)
