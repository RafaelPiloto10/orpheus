Well it's time to pay the fiddler and it's sad to know we've danced it all
away  
But the one night's disappearing leaving nothin' but the cold hard light of
day  
And it's time to start erasin' all the rainbows we've been chasing in our
minds  
We know there's no way of making other ties on us unravel and unwind  
Yes it's time to pay the fiddler and today's the day the thirsty someones do  
For the rest of all my days I wonder why the maker mismatched me and you  
But there's so much to consider like my man and little baby  
Will need and want my love just like you do  
Now it's time to pay the fiddler but before we pay the fiddler  
Let's say to him please play one last final tune  
[ fiddle ]  
Well it's time to pay the fiddler now there's naked sorrow drippin' from my
eyes  
On'ry stranded and unshamed we've loved each other now we've got to leave it
lie  
But I can feel my hands a trembling and I search to find a handle on the door  
So let's let the fiddler pull his magic bow across our heart strings just once
more  
Yes it's time to pay the fiddler...
