It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you  
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Just think how long I've known you, it's long for me to own you, lock and key  
It's really not confusing, I'm just the young illusion, can't you see  
  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry

Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry
