You know I been trying to figure out  
Just what's going on  
Am I over her?  
I been doing a lot of thinking lately  
Am I over her?  
And I'm really missing you  
  
It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days  
Since the last time I seen your pretty face  
My decision to bring this to an end  
And I'm caught up in reminscing  
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks  
Play fights, late nights  
It's been on my mind since Valentine's  
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide  
  
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)  
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)  
  
Am I over her? (am I over her?)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)  
I can't think straight  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain  
Now my situation's taking a big change  
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town  
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around  
Is she sad or is she mad?  
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?  
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on  
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone  
  
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)  
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)  
  
Am I over her? (am I over her?)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)  
I can't think straight  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
It's water under the bridge  
But I can't seem to forget  
All the plans we made, all the time we spent  
Makes me reminisce  
I still see your face  
All this love I can't replace  
Am I over (am I over)  
Am I over her? (her now)  
  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her? (am I)  
Am I over her? (am I over)  
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love my love)  
I can't think straight (my love)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)  
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)  
  
No  
Am I over her?  
No not over her no  
Ohhhhhh  
Am I over her?  
  
Am I over her? (over her)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her, am I over her?)  
I can't think straight (I'm not over her)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love? (ahh oooh)  
  
I'm not over my my my love  
I'm not over my my my love  
I'm not over my my my love (oh no no)  
I'm not over my my my love  
  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my love my love, she's my love, she's my)  
Tell me am I really over my my love (she's my everything)  
I can't think straight (she's my everything, my everything)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
Not over not over my love  
Not over not over my love  
I'm not over not over my love  
Am I over her?  
Not over not over my love..
