I've been loved and I've been shoved  
beaten every step of the way  
lived by the glass  
and got a little ass  
three or four times a day  
  
Well, I've seen blood like Noah's flood  
I think its gonna take us away  
Tellin' you should listen real good  
Hells come back to stay  
  
Well you can't take it with you  
Its a one way ride  
Baby's had enough of lookin'  
  
In from the outside  
In from the outside  
  
Feelin' down low, time to let go  
you're only as good as you please  
Walk before you crawl, make the last call  
You need it like a social disease  
  
Well you can't take it with you  
Its a one way ride  
Baby's had enough of lookin'  
  
In from the outside  
In from the outside  
In from the outside  
  
I've been loved and I've been shoved  
Beaten every step of the way  
Lived by the glass  
And got a little ass  
Three or four times a day  
  
Well you can't take it with you  
Its a one way ride  
Baby's had enough of lookin'  
  
In from the outside  
In from the outside  
In from the outside
