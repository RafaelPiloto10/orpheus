Verse  
WAY DOWN HERE  
YOU NEED A REASON TO MOVE  
FEEL A FOOL  
RUNNIN' YOUR STATE SIDE GAME  
LOSE YOUR LOAD  
LEAVE YOUR MIND BEHIND, BABY JAMES  
  
Chorus  
OH MEXICO  
IT SOUNDS SO SIMPLE  
I JUST GOT TO GO  
THE SUN'S SO HOT  
I FORGOT TO GO HOME  
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW  
  
Verse  
AMERICANO'S GOT THE SLEEPY EYES  
BUT HIS BODY'S STILL SHAKEN LIKE A LIVE WIRE  
SENIORITA WITH HER EYES ON FIRE, DON'T YOU KNOW  
  
Chorus  
OH MEXICO  
IT SOUNDS SO SWEET  
WITH THE SUN SINKIN' LOW  
THE MOONS SO BRIGHT  
LIKE TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT  
MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT  
  
Verse  
BABYS HUNGRY  
AND THE MONEY'S ALL GONE  
THE FOLKS BACK HOME  
DON'T WANT TO TALK ON THE PHONE  
SHE GETS A LONG LETTER  
SENDS BACK A POST CARD  
TIMES ARE HARD  
  
Chorus  
OH DOWN IN MEXICO  
I NEVER REALLY BEEN  
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW  
OOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW  
OOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN  
BUT I'D SURE LIKE TO GO  
WOOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW
