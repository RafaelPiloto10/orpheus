God is good and fate is great  
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait  
You never know how it might unfold  
Hearts to break and bodies to hold  
Time will tell but it never gets old  
Like I told you I'm in for the long long  
  
Had to of been one of those things that took place in outer space  
A match made in heaven, not a scratch on her face  
Angels must have smoked some dust  
Singing songs about "In God We Trust"  
Something sly, but this is a must  
Like I told you there's a time for finding out  
  
Ah people try to tell me what not to do  
You shouldn't make it with a younger girl and  
Too many chances for the foot to drop,  
I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well  
Like I told you be careful what you're asking for  
  
This is to Brutus  
Gotta mess of a better hell, ow  
This is to Judas  
Even you never had my back  
  
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see  
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea  
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care  
I had to find out, these moments are rare  
And Stevie says, "All is fair"  
Like I told you there is something for everyone  
  
Well I guess I never told you some things  
That I really, really wanted to say  
Did I do everything I could do,  
Or did the mice just need to play?  
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye  
  
This is to Brutus  
Gotta mess of a better hell, ow  
I said this is to Judas  
Even you never had my back  
  
I'm not trying to point fingers at you  
And I'm not trying to lay any blame  
But when it comes to the punishment  
Girl you know how to bring the pain  
Like I told you I'd do it all again  
  
This is to Brutus  
I gotta mess of a better hell, ow  
I said this is to Judas!  
Even you never had my back  
  
Come on  
This is to Brutus  
There's a jury to the woman's lap, ow  
This is to Judas  
Even you never had my back
