We've been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
I'm gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
I'm gonna smash it up till there's nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
  
People call me weird, oh it's such a shame  
Maybe it's my clothes, must be to blame  
I don't even care if I look a mess  
Don't want to be a sucker like all the rest  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
And you can keep your crystal glasses  
Smash it up  
And you can see a very dead-way end  
Smash it up  
And you can stick a frothy lager  
Smash it up  
Up the fuck with your lesson  
  
We've been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
I'm gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
I'm gonna smash it up till there's nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
And everybody's smashing things down  
I said everybody's smashing things down
