GOOD TIMES  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
If you think you got troubles  
I knew a girl named bubbles  
She did a dance she called the paradise  
Ain't that nice  
One night she did her dance  
She had them in a trance  
Till some wise guy brought a safety pin  
Now she wears a grin  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ride on ride on your merry-go-round  
Don't be afraid cause it won't break down  
Dance and sing and raise your glass  
Drink to the good times and hope my friend  
That they last  
  
So if you're feeling blue  
It's really nothing new  
And here's a lesson  
You should take from me  
Because it's free  
Just you remember friend,  
To find that happy end  
To find a pot of gold  
Where rainbows shine  
You got to take the time  
  
[Chorus]
