When Robert E Lee surrendered the Confederacy Jefferson Davis was upset about
it  
He said how dare that man resent an order  
Form the president of the Confederate States of America  
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself  
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up  
Would cost about twenty thousand lives on both sides  
And he said two hundred and forty thousand dead already is enough  
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother
war  
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won  
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say god bless Robert E Lee  
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down  
Cotton fields are blue with Sherman's troupes  
I overheard a Yankee say yesterday Nashville fell  
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help  
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see  
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee  
Sherman's troupes burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky  
And those of us who survived it are watchin' my Dixie die  
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down  
And surrender to the Yankees and Ulysees S Grant  
So look away look away Dixie...  
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground  
And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E Lee
