You've never driven through a red light,  
Or let your mind leave your body.  
It's pitch black in bed every night:  
You set the clock right for the morning alarm.  
You've never wanted to start any fights,  
Don't know a thing about tapping in on wires.  
I fill the room with people  
But still you sit empty,  
Stuck like putty.  
I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll,  
But you couldn't get over the old one-two,  
And nevertheless, you'll do.  
Nevertheless, you'll do.  
Nevertheless, I do.  
You're getting up in the morning and put on your suit [ca. 0'55]  
For the office, and leave me.  
You come home all pushed and pulled,  
At six-thirty in the evening.  
The television, it takes you away  
To a picture-world where I have no say in it.  
I fill the room with people  
But still you sit empty,  
Stuck like putty.  
I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll,  
But you couldn't get over the old one-two,  
And nevertheless, you'll do.  
Nevertheless, you'll do.  
Nevertheless, I do
