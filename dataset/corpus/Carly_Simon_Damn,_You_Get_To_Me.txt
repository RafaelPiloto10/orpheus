Hey, when I say things that bother you  
Don't be a stubborn man  
Don't leave me in the cold  
Remember who I am  
Damn, you get to me  
When I can't get to you,  
No fair, you're silent and you're hurt  
And all I want to do  
Is know what I've done wrong  
All I want to know is what to do  
Damn, you get to me  
When I can't get to you  
There's too much long distance  
In our love  
And tonight I need you  
Don't run away, please let me know  
How I've hurt you  
Hey, it's me, see I'm the lucky one  
You've opened up my heart  
You led me by the hand  
You took me slow so I would understand  
Damn, you got to me  
Let me get to you
