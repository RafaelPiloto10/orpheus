Saw my father living in a picture  
Squinting in the Michigan sun  
'Caught forever in his blouse and knickers  
Wasn't he the lucky one?  
While the fear is growing stronger  
The sun is almost gone  
So hold me in your naked eye  
And shoot me on the run  
  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another picture  
Please, please freeze my features  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another  
I don't want to fade away  
  
I saw a picture hidden in the bedroom  
Underneath father's ties  
A beautiful woman caught naked forever  
Black strip over her eyes  
I still remember that picture  
The image sits sharp and clear  
And I'll never erase that eyeless face  
Still smiling all these years  
  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another picture  
Please, please freeze my features  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another  
I don't want to fade away
