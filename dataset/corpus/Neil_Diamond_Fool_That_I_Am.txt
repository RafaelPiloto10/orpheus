Fool that I am  
Oh, I let love past me on by  
Oh, now I know that so lonely  
And every night I sit in my room  
And think about a love that might have been  
Fool that I am  
  
Darling, you came to me  
Oh, I turned you away  
And I first consented  
You offered a love, ya  
That was so sweet and good  
And now the chance  
Will never come again  
Fool that I am  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
Once I thought love was just a game, baby  
Mmm mmm  
Just to be played, to be played  
Now I know the truth  
It's t to late, It's just to late  
A little bit to late  
It's to late, to late, to late, to late  
  
I turn this way  
Just to have have you in my arms  
But I know you'll turn away  
It's all over  
  
You gave me the chance, ya  
For a lasting love  
But I just laughed and sent you on your way  
Fool That I Am  
  
The Fool That I Am  
The Fool That I Am  
  
I'm not gonna let you see me cry, baby  
But 'm not to proud, not to proud  
I'll get down on my knees  
No, I'm not to proud baby  
No no no no no no no  
I'm not to proud
