There's a high flyin' bird, way up in the sky  
And I wonder does she looks down, as she flies on by?  
Just floatin' so free and easy in the sky  
  
Oh look at me here  
I'm just rooted like a tree here  
I got them sit-down, can't fly  
Oh Lord I'm gonna die blues  
(I'm gonna die blues)  
  
Well the sun comes along and she lights up the day  
And then when she gets tired, she just flies along on her way  
From the east to the west, she goes down every day  
  
But look at me here  
I'm just rooted like a tree here  
I got them sit-down, can't fly  
Oh Lord I'm gonna die blues  
(I'm gonna die blues)  
  
Now I once knew a man  
He worked in a mine  
Well he never saw the sun  
But then he never stopped tryin'  
  
Then one day that old man, he up and he died  
Yeah, he up and he died  
He up and he died  
Well he wanted to die and the only way to fly was to die  
  
Lord I'm gonna die blues  
Lord I'm gonna die blues  
Lord I'm gonna die blues  
  
There's a high flyin' bird, way up in the sky  
I wonder does she looks down as she flies on by  
Just ridin' so free and easy in the sky  
  
Look at me here  
I'm rooted like a tree here  
I got them sit-down, can't fly  
Oh Lord I'm gonna die blues  
God I'm gonna die blues  
  
I know I'm gonna die blues  
Oh I'm gonna die blues  
Gonna die blues  
Gonna die blues
