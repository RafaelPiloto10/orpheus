You believe there's something else  
To relieve your emptiness  
And you dream about yourself  
And you bleed and breath the air  
And its on and on and on and on and on  
  
I just kinda died for you  
You just kinda stared at me  
We will always have the chance  
We can do this one more time  
  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
All this time  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
  
Take me now  
You spin the sun around  
And the stars will all come out  
Then we turn and come back down  
Turn and come back down  
  
You believe there's somewhere else  
Where it's easier than this  
And you see outside yourself  
And you buy the hole you'll fill  
And it's on and on and on and on and on  
  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
All this time  
Hell yeah, I remember aurora  
  
Take me now  
You spin the sun around  
And the stars will all come out  
Then we turn and come back down  
Turn and come back down  
On and on and on aurora  
Wait for everyone  
Wait till the last one's done  
  
Take me now  
You spin the sun around  
And the stars will all come out  
Then we turn and come back down  
Turn and come back down  
Turn and come back down  
  
On and on and on and on...
