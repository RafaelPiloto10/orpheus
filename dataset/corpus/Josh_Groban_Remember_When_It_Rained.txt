Wash away the thoughts inside  
That keep my mind away from you  
No more love and no more pride  
And thoughts are all I have to do  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and look up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the darkness I remain  
  
Tears of hope run down my skin  
Tears for you that will not dry  
They magnify the one within  
And let the outside slowly die  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and looked up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the water I remain  
  
Running down
