Oh, what a night  
But now I must forget you  
But my heart won't let you  
Out of my life  
Oh, what a day  
We walked around the city  
You said now isn't it a pity  
That I couldn't stay  
But if I could life that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
(just one chance)  
I'd stay another day  
Oh, what a night  
Your kisses were so tender  
I always will remember  
The promises we made  
Oh, what a day  
You smiled and it was magic  
I thought it was tragic  
I had to go away  
But if I could live that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
(just one chance)  
I'd stay another day  
Oh, what a night  
Oh what a night (oh yeah)  
At last we're back together  
I've been wondering whether  
It would feel the same  
Oh what a day (oh no)  
When you said you had another  
I guess I'll recover  
To love again someday  
But if I could live that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
I'd stay another (stay another) day  
I'd stay another day
