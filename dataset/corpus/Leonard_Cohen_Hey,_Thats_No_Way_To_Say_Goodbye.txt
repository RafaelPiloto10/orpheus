Leonard Cohen - Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye  
  
I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,  
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,  
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new,  
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you,  
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try,  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,  
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.  
  
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time,  
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme  
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,  
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,  
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,  
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.  
  
I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,  
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,  
Yes many loved before us, I know that we are not new,  
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you,  
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,  
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
