"Isn't it strange  
That the stars don't shine no more now since you're gone  
Isn't it strange  
That we kinda look back and say just what went wrong  
  
I wanna know where we are  
Should I pretend and let things be  
I wanna know when what you've done  
Could you come face to face with me  
  
Isn't it strange  
That you told me one thing suddenly changed your mind  
Isn't it strange  
That you called me for me turn away and leave me behind  
  
Now it feels like I'm drowning  
Feels like I'm drowning without you  
I know the feeling  
'Cause I felt this all before..  
  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
  
Isn't it strange  
That the world seems to turn away when I try to explain  
What's so strange  
That two can't be as one....  
  
Now it feels like I'm drowning  
Feels like I'm drowning without you  
I know the feeling  
'Cause I felt this all before  
And it feels like I'm dying  
Feels like I'm dying now I know the truth  
  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
Fuck I hope you feel much worse than me  
Maybe not so happy  
Not so happy, yeah, not so happy, yeah  
Not so happy, welcome to my world  
Not so happy, yeah, not so happy, yeah  
Not so happy, welcome to my world"
