The day the door is closed  
The echoes fill your soul  
They won't say which way to go  
Just trust your heart  
  
To find what you're here for  
Open another door  
But I'm not sure anymore  
It's just so hard  
  
The voices in my head  
Tell me they know best  
Got me on the edge  
They're pushin', pushin'  
They're pushin'  
  
I know they've got a plan  
But the ball's in my hands  
This time it's man-to-man  
I'm droppin', fightin' inside the  
  
Whole world's upside down  
It's spinning faster  
What do I do now without ya?  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I'm kickin' down the walls  
I gotta make 'em fall  
Just break through them all  
I'm pushin', crashin'  
I'm gonna fight to find myself  
Me and no one else  
Which way I get down  
Searchin', searchin'  
Can't find a  
  
Road that I should take  
I should, tomorrow left us  
It's like nothing works without you  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
Yeah, the clock's running down  
Hear the crowd gettin' loud  
I'm consumed by the sound  
Is it hurt? Is it love?  
Can the music ever be enough?  
Gotta work it out, work it out  
You can do it, you can do it  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
I want my own thing  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream, oh, ahh!
