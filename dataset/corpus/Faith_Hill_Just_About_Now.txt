Just about now  
I'd be watching you wake up  
Feeling my heart beat with yours  
Just about now  
  
Is when we would make love  
Like all of the mornings before  
But I know it don't help  
To turn the clock back  
  
'Cause I'm not gonna make it  
'Til I face this fact  
  
This is not about trying  
To go back in time  
This is not about where  
I'll be a year down the line  
  
It's just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now  
  
Just about now  
You'd pull in the driveway  
And I'd be there waving hello  
Run to my arms  
  
You'd kiss me and hold me  
As if you'd never let go  
And it's just about now  
When the tears start to fall  
  
I wonder if I'm gonna make it at all  
  
This is not about trying  
To go back in time  
This is not about where  
I'll be a year down the line  
  
It's just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now  
  
It's just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now
