I can't see you mama  
But I can hardly wait  
Ooh to touch and to feel you mama  
Oh I just can't keep away  
It's the heat and the steam of the city  
Oh it's got me running and I just can't break  
So say you'll help me mama  
Cause it's getting so hard  
  
Now I can't keep you mama  
But I know you're always there  
You listen, you teach me mama  
And I know inside you care  
So get down, down here beside me  
Oh you ain't going nowhere  
No I won't hurt you mama  
But it's getting so hard  
  
Can't you see me mama  
Mama mama mama please  
Can't you feel my heart  
Can't you feel my heart  
Can't you feel my heart ooh  
Listen to me mama  
Mama mama  
You're taking away my last chances  
Don't take it away  
Can't you feel my heart?...  
  
It's hot, too hot for me mama  
But I can't hardly wait  
but My eyes they're burning mama and I can feel my body shake  
Don't stop, don't stop me mama' I won't make the pain, make it go away No I
won't hurt you mama  
But it's getting so hard  
  
Now I can't see you mama  
But I know you're always there  
You taunt, you tease me mama  
But I never, never can keep away  
It's the heat and the steam of the city
