In this jury  
There are peddlers and disbelievers  
In this fountain  
There are silver dollars and penniless creatures  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's your gravity and your hot air balloons  
That keep you real and dare to dream with you  
That when they pull you too far  
You must learn to forgive and ask your heart  
Will I lose a friend  
Striving to contend?  
Will I destroy this trust  
When I want the best for us?  
Should I hold your hand  
No matter what you plan?  
For every hour you need  
I will follow, if you lead  
  
In this home  
There is family and just familiar faces  
In this pilgrimmage  
We disavow our brothers and confide in strangers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you have believed  
That the earth was flat or round?  
Would you have bet you lived before  
Or is this your first time around?  
Do you believe we're here to learn?  
Do you dream in black or white  
Or are you colouring your lost and found  
To make it bright?  
  
[Chorus]
