L.A. Lakers fast break makers  
Kinds of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact  
M-a-g-i-see see you on the court  
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart  
M-a-g-i-see magic of the buck  
Other teams pray for dreams  
But he don't give a [fuck]  
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train  
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain  
Knucklehead suckers better duck  
When the buck comes through like a truck  
Scott stops pops and drops it in  
On his way back gets a little skin  
From the hand of a man named a. c. green  
Slam so hard break your t.v. screen  
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk  
Take it to the hole make your mamma talk  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly  
Cause they got more moves  
That a bowl full of jelly  
The buck stops here - pops - then cheers  
A roar through the forum  
That deafens my ears  
The one and only know if his kind  
Sits in a throne  
Not for the records that he holds  
But for being bald and bold  
Kareem Abdul Jabbar  
All time great super super star  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble  
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson
