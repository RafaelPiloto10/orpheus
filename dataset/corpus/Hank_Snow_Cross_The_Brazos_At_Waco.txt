On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind  
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind  
Too long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone  
But today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old San Antone  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone  
  
He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight  
He'd sent for Carmela to meet him at the banks of the Brazos tonight  
She was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago  
As he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty Brazos below  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'll walk straight in old San Antone  
  
Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found  
As the ranger's band shoot brightly and bandito laid on the ground  
Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain  
As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone  
  
I'm safe when I reach San Antone
