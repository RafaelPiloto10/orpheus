Just when I thought I'd found someone to trust,  
You took away your love and  
Hurt me  
I still can't believe you hurt me  
Just when I thought it was safe to come in  
You let me want you, and need you, an then  
You left me, like a child in the rain  
Now I'm mending myself of the pain  
Oh, you hurt me  
  
Yes, you left me  
Like a child in the rain  
Now I'm lost in an ocean of pain  
Oh, you hurt me  
Can't you imagine how I'm feeling now?  
Oh, will you ever know how?  
You, hurt me
