It's a mystery to me, the game commences  
For the usual fee, plus expenses  
Confidential information, it's a diary  
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry  
  
I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt  
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work  
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it  
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it  
  
And what have you got at the end of the day?  
What have you got to take away?  
A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies  
Blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes  
Scarred for life, no compensation  
Private investigations
