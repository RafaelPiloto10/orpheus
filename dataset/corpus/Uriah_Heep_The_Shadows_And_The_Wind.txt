Oh, they're moving in again  
Hidden by the shadows  
And the wind  
But we'll just wait awhile and then  
We'll show 'em all that  
This time we ain't giving in  
  
Without a care they  
Sweep aside our dreams  
To try and make way for their own  
No more should we surrender  
To their schemes  
It's time to stand and  
Show 'em we are not alone  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
And it's time to use it, use it  
  
Nature gave us colour  
Day and night  
So if you really got a reason  
Then you better be right  
The seasons of the year  
Still are spring and fall  
But there's nothing in the world  
That's says it's right to fight  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
Why don't we use it  
Come on and use it  
Why don't we use it  
Come on and use it  
  
La la la la la ...
