The woman's like the night  
She comes and goes  
She breaks my heart each day  
And never knows,  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time I live  
And the time that's left is  
All I have to give.  
  
The woman's like an ivy on a pole  
She wraps her twisted love around my soul  
There will come a sudden winter  
When she'll seek the warmth of day  
And there'll come a time when she will come to stay.  
  
The woman's like the tide  
She comes and goes  
She knows the things that I can just suppose.  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time that she laughs  
And the songs I sing cannot explain but half.
