Heat wave  
Heat wave  
  
Whenever I'm with you  
Something inside  
Starts to burn deep  
And my heart's filled with fire  
Could be that I'm very sentimental  
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
I can't keep from crying  
Tearing me apart  
  
Sometimes she calls my name  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain  
  
I feel, yeah I feel  
I feel this burning flame  
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me  
'Cause this is the way love's supposed to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Just give me another chance  
This could be a new romance  
  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Heat wave
