Whoa wow whoa wow whoa wow  
Whoa wow whoa wow whoa wow  
Ow  
  
You see it all in my smile  
You hear it all in my laugh  
The way I walk you hear me talkin,  
No, I'm no longer sad  
I've got more reason to smile  
More now than I've ever had  
Open my eyes and realized  
That nothing's quite that bad  
  
I've got a different approach  
To dealin' with emotion  
Keeping control of my boat  
While drifting on this ocean  
Keepin my head to the sky  
Keepin tears outta my eyes  
Unless happiness be the reason  
That I decide to cry  
  
And lifes too short to dwell on all that's wrong  
Stand up now  
Stand up now and I promise not before long  
  
Chorus  
You'll be feelin better today  
Much better today, much better today  
So much better  
Feelin' better today  
Much better today, much better today  
Much better today  
(Repeat)  
  
Feelin so much better  
  
I know about down and out  
I know about when it gets tough  
Losing the fight, you see the light,  
And you just want to give up  
I know about being depressed  
About leaving someone you love  
I also know about standing up  
And saying enough is enough  
I've got a different approach  
To dealin' with emotion  
Keeping control of my boat  
While drifting on this ocean  
Keeping my head to the sky  
Keeping tears outta my eyes  
Unless happiness be the reason  
That I decide to cry  
  
And lifes too short to dwell on all that's wrong  
Stand up now  
Stand up now, and I promise not before long  
  
Chorus  
You'll be feelin better today  
Much better today, much better today  
So much better  
Feelin' better today  
Much better today, much better today  
Much better today  
(Repeat)  
  
Feeling so much better  
  
Ahhh aaaahhh aaaahh  
  
Oooooooooo  
What will I give I tried  
I could fly away right now  
Hold me cause I finally found my smile  
  
Chorus  
You'll be feelin better today  
Much better today, much better today  
So much better  
Feelin' better today  
Much better today, much better today  
Much better today  
(Repeat)  
  
Feeling so much better
