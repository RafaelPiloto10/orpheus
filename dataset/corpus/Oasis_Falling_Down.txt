The summer sun  
It blows my mind  
It's falling down on all that I've ever known  
Time to kiss the world goodbye  
Falling down on all that I've ever known  
Is all that I've ever known  
  
A dying scream  
It makes no sound  
Calling out to all that I've ever known  
Here am I, lost and found  
Calling out to all  
  
We live a dying dream  
If you know what I mean  
All that I've ever known  
It's all that I've ever known  
  
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly  
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide  
I tried to talk with God to no avail  
Calling my name and out of nowhere  
I said "If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"  
  
(All that I've ever known)  
(It's all that I've ever known)  
  
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly  
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide  
I tried to talk with God to no avail  
Calling my name and out of nowhere  
I said "If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"  
  
The summer sun  
It blows my mind  
It's falling down on all that I've ever known  
Time to kiss the world goodbye  
Falling down on all that I've ever known  
Is all that I've ever known
