You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town
