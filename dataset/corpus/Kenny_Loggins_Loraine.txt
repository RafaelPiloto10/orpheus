Hold me  
Long enough to tell me  
What you told me  
Long ago  
Before you got to know me  
  
Only when lovers try  
They learn to talk it out  
To keep their love alive  
That's the only way, I say,  
That love survives  
Its time we try  
  
Chorus:  
Loraine  
Won't you show the way  
Hearts that bend won't break  
When they learn to face the truth now  
Show me how  
  
Loraine  
I know you feel the same  
Hold me now  
I don't know what to say  
I'm so in love with you  
Loraine  
  
Talk to me  
Isn't that the way it ought to be?  
But what's the use if we end up a memory  
Remembering our honesty  
I always thought that's what you want of me  
But now the truth has made you turn your back on me  
Oh, can't you see  
  
Chorus then Bridge:  
I've got to find a way  
I beg you babe  
I need to hear you say  
You love me  
  
If I have the chance  
I won't let you go  
I'll stay by your side  
I'll be lovin' you darlin'  
And for all of my life  
I will let you know  
You're my only love  
Just believe in me darlin'  
  
Look in my eyes  
I swear this is true  
I you want it  
You got it  
I promise you Loraine  
  
Repeat Chorus to fade  
  
I swear I love you  
I always will  
This kind of feeling never came to me until Loraine
