You're young and hungry and you're not satisfied  
You take your chances and walk that tentative line  
You push a little harder and leave old friends behind  
But, baby, sooner or later you could wake up and find  
That you have run out of time, and you know you've got  
  
Nowhere left to hide  
Nothing to protect your heart this time  
You've got nowhere left to hide  
  
You know the feeling of walking out in that ring  
You weigh your hunger against the fear that it brings  
And in that moment at night when you finally decide  
You better be sure you've got shelter  
When the whole thing unwinds  
And something's breaking inside  
Cause you know you've got  
  
Nowhere left to hide  
Nothing to protect your heart this time  
You've got nowhere left to hide  
  
No regrets, alibis, you know your chances this time
