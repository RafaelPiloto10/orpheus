Gracious Good Shepherd  
Do you really know who I am?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
Will you answer when I call your name?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
You can hear confusion crying out  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
What little faith I have I am ashamed  
  
I visualize an angel  
All freezing and bitter cold  
I cannot believe the love there  
What heavenly sacrifice  
  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
If you hear me now, I love you so  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
Why for me?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
You say you love the lost born  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
I believe that one is me  
  
Some tell me the virgin birth is  
A beautiful ancient tale  
But you tell me God's constellation  
Led all to the living well  
  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
If you hear me now, I love you so  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
Why, why for me?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
Do you really know who I am?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
Will you answer when I call your name?  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
These are different times, I'm sure you see  
Gracious Good Shepherd  
We need, you now
