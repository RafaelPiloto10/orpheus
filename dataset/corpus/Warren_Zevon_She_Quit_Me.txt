Special Markets  
It wasn't the queen of diamonds that I drew first  
Instead I got the ace of spades reversed  
She quit me  
She up and quit me, man--yeah  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me  
It wasn't because I didn't treat her right--no  
When dawn had drawn the curtains of the night  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me, man  
She quit me  
She up and quit me--yeah  
It wasn't because I didn't treat her kind  
I wonder who put leaving on her mind  
She quit me  
She up and she quit me, man  
She quit me  
She up and quit me--yeah  
It wasn't because I couldn't satisfy--no  
Now where'd she get the nerve to say goodbye  
Oh, she quit me  
She up and quit me, man--oh, yeah  
She quit me  
She up and quit me--yeah
