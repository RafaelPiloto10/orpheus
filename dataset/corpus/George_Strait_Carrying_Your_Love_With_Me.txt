Baby all I've got is this beat-up leather bag  
And everything I own don't fill up half  
But don't you worry 'bout the way I pack  
All I care about is getting back real soon  
A good-bye kiss is all I need from you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me  
West Virginia down to Tennessee  
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed  
Carrying your love with me  
It's my strength, for holding on  
Every minute that I have to be gone  
I'll have everything I'll ever need  
Carrying your love with me  
  
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain  
Darling all I have to do is speak your name  
The clouds rollback and the waters part  
The sun starts shining in my heart for you  
You're right there in everything I do  
  
[Chorus: x2]
