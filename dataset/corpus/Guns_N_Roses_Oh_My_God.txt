It's not how you're thinking  
Like you've been right  
You've been living a trade-off  
Believe your own version  
Believe your enslavery and drain out your soul  
What can I do when there's so many liars  
That crawl through your veins  
Like millions of spiders  
That seek out their victims  
And ruin the wiser  
Watch out  
Gotcha  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to kill and fight this  
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it  
Like nobody wanted to know  
  
So give it away  
Like they're not gonna fuck you  
How long can you bear him  
To come back and haunt you  
To burn past your feelings  
And cause you to suffer  
You're starting to bleed  
They don't give you up  
Before its too late  
What will you offer  
In way of a healing  
I'm so confused, abused, misused  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to kill and fight this  
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it  
Like nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a strong compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
Ooh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than the last compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shadows  
If only you had let me know  
  
And they won't give in  
Cause they know what they're after  
A kick in the face  
Like its all that would matter  
Oh  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to murder and fight this  
To bury it deeper where no one can find it  
'cause nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a good compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
  
Oh, well its on with the show  
Like the tide down on the ocean  
The waves already set in motion  
The only one in the game that's lost is you
