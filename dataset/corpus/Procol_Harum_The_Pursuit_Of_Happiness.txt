One into one won't go  
Two out of three don't know  
Time and tide in man's affairs  
Trouble always comes in pairs  
Wonder where the picture went?  
What we got ain't worth a cent  
What we got ain't worth a damn  
Someone's screwed the master plan  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
It's a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what we're told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again  
  
Bite the bullet in the dust  
Got to take their word on thrust  
No use counting down your prayers  
All God's children running scared  
No use howling at the moon  
Planet Earth is going soon  
Starving children stand on line  
Living now on borrowed time  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
It's a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what we're told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again
