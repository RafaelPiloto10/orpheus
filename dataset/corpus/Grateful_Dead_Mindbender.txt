If only I could be less blind  
If only I knew what to find  
Everywhere and all of the time  
It's bending my mind  
  
Confusion's prince is at my door  
The crown I wear is the one he wore  
He's here to bring me down some more  
And bend my mind  
  
The friendly stranger calls my name  
He only wants me for his game  
But it don't matter, just the same  
I'll bend his mind  
  
I've waved my flags into the sun  
I've fought my wars and now they're won  
And I didn't need nobody's gun  
I bent their mind  
  
If only I could be less blind  
If only I knew what to find  
Everywhere and all of the time  
It's bending my mind
