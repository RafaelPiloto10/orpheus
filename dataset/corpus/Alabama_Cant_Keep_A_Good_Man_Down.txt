I thought it was forever  
I thought it would last  
Gotta try to make it  
A page of my past  
You didn't even say goodbye  
When you slammed that door  
  
Now I'm lyin' here alone  
In what once was our bed  
Trying to forget  
All the cruel words you said  
All the radio was playing  
What once was our favorite song  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Gonna dress up in my finest  
Clothes that I own  
And take it to the streets  
I won't be lonely for long  
Gonna put on my best moves  
On every single woman I see  
  
Now you thought you could break me  
Add me to your list  
Notch me on your gun  
Let me tell you this  
I've got news for you baby  
I don't break that easily  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
I'll be out there on the scene  
Hangin' with my friends  
This world's gonna see  
Me smilin' again  
I'm taking some time  
To erase you from my memory  
  
Don't write any letters  
Don't call me on the phone  
Don't knock on my door  
Cause to you I'm not at home  
I know there's a woman out there  
For a man like me  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
Baby, you can't keep a good man down  
Honey, you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down
