Starlight falling through your hair  
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there  
Awake in the morning a smile on your face  
The same old feeling that I just can't place  
And you say don't cry, baby  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry, baby  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
A man came in with a violin  
He played for me like I've never been  
Courted before and forevermore  
As the bow touched the strings  
He made the whole world sing  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know there'll always be someone who cares  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
I know I've been wrong  
You've had to be strong  
I guess I belong to you, my baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
The sound of your voice singing songs in the night  
Have taken me far away and mystified  
The songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes  
The words that you'd spoken made me realize
