O Christmas tree  
Thy leaves are so unchanging  
Not only green when summer's here  
But also when 'tis cold and drear  
  
O Christmas tree  
Thy leaves are so unchanging  
O Christmas tree  
Much pleasure thou can't give me  
How often has the Christmas tree  
Afforded me the greatest glee  
  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
How richly God has decked thee  
Thou bidst us true and faithful be  
And trust in God unchangingly.  
O Christmas tree
