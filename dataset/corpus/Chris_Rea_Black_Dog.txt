Black dog barking in the cold grey light  
He pulls the chain and he pulls it tight  
This ain't no lonesome wail that boy ain't faking  
He bites the steel and he claws the ground  
He pulls again and he spins around  
His eyes are raging and his burning lungs are steaming  
  
He want to walk in the sun  
Feel love like anyone  
No one knows that black dog better than I  
I said no one knows that black dog better than I  
  
When I see his running I can see me  
Teeth in the collar and he's tearing it free  
Spit out the leather and the cold studs that kept you from singing  
Run till you're bleeding run till you're hot  
till the memory of all this you've long since forgot  
Run till forever till the bells of your freedom are ringing  
  
He want to walk in the sun  
Feel love like anyone  
No one knows that black dog better than I  
I said no one knows that black dog better than I
