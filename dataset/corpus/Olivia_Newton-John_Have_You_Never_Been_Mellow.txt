There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are  
I was like you  
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view  
I was like you  
Now I don't mean to make you frown  
No, I just want you to slow down  
  
Have you never been mellow?  
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?  
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?  
Have you never let someone else be strong?  
  
Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds  
I was like you  
Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes  
I was like you  
Now you're not hard to understand  
You need someone to hold your hand  
  
Have you never been mellow?  
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?  
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?  
Have you never let someone else be strong?
