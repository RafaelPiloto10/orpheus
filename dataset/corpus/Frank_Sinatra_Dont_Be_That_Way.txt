April skies are in your eyes, but darling, don't be blue  
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way.  
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way  
The rain will bring the violets of may  
Tears are in vain, so honey please don't be that way  
As long as we see it through, you'll have me, i'll have you  
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart, oh honey, please don't be that way  
  
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way  
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way  
The rain will bring the violets of may  
Tears in vain, so honey please don't be that way  
As long as we will see it through  
You'll have me and i'll have you  
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart, nh honey, please don't be that way,  
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
