Warrior in woolworths  
Behind his serville innocence  
He's the rebel on the underground  
He plots and he schemes  
Humble he may seem  
She's the rebel of the modern town  
He's the rebel on the underground  
His roots are in today  
Warrior in woolworths  
She's the rebel of the modern town  
Doesn't know no history  
Warrior in woolworths  
He threw the past away  
Weapons rule their livesDips on Friday nights  
Youths meet at stockwell tube
