I remember me sittin' on my daddy's knee  
Dreamin' 'bout what life had in store for me  
When I look back now it really makes me mad  
The years I took for granted were the best I had  
  
School was alright  
Gave me time to fantasize  
But one day I woke up  
And I realized  
  
I'm livin' in the real world  
Everything's written in black and white  
Livin' in the real world  
Where you don't get nothin' unless you fight  
  
I want to relax but I don't know how  
The pressures on me are much stronger now  
I remember the days I didn't have a care  
Aside from being afraid somebody'd cut my hair  
  
I want to make it  
Before my chances are gone  
They say be patient  
But it takes too long  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Real world  
Where there ain't no holiday in sight  
Livin' in the real world  
Where you don't get nothin' unless you fight  
  
Someday soon I'll settle down for good  
There was a time I thought I never would  
I'm gonna live with a lady on a quiet beach  
I'm gonna have three kids, maybe one of each  
  
I've got to make it  
Before my chances are gone  
They say be patient  
But it takes too long  
  
Repeat chorus
