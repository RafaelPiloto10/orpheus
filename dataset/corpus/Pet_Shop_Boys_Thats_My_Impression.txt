I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly, I realised  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
The wind was chilly and the sky was dull  
I went for shelter to the temple  
Once inside I couldn't believe my eyes  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
Go to a club, you think I'll be there  
I don't go 'cause I'm not a member  
You said you went to apologize  
It's plain to me that's one more lie  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly, I realized  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
It's an expression  
And a suggestion  
I learned my lesson  
That's my impression  
That's my impression (impression)  
That's my impression  
That's my impression (impression)  
I learned my lesson  
  
I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly I realized  
You'd been and gone, I know  
You lied that's my impression  
I know you lied  
And that's my impression  
That's my impression  
My impression  
That's my impression
