Do what you gotta do  
Come on back see me when you can  
Man I can understand how it might be  
Kinda hard to love a girl like me  
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free  
I just wanted you to know  
I've loved you better that your own kin did  
From the very start it's my own fault  
What happens to my heart  
You see I've always known you'd go  
  
So you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss  
Those sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me when you can  
  
Now I know it'll make you feel sad  
And make you feel so bad  
They say you don't treat me me like you should  
They got ways to make you feels no good  
I guess they got no way to know  
I've had my eyes wide open from the start  
And man you never lied to me  
The part of you that they'll never see  
Is the part you've shown to me  
  
So you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss  
Those sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me when you can
