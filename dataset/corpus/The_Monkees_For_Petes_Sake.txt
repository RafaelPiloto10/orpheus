Love is understanding,  
Don't you know that this is true.  
Love is understanding,  
It's in everything we do.  
  
In this generation,  
In this lovin' time,  
In this generation,  
We will make the world shine.  
  
We were born to love one another  
This is something we all need.  
We were born to love one another  
We must be what we're goin' to be  
And what we have to be is free.
