I had a little monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on  
Ginger bread  
Along came a choo choo knoked my monkey coo coo and now my monkey's  
Dead  
At least he looks that way but then again don't we all?  
What I make is what I am  
  
I can't be forever  
"Make you break you make you break you lookout"  
We are our own wicked gods with little g's and big dicks  
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise  
The primate's scream of consonance is a reflection  
Of his own mind's dissonance
