Anybody out there  
Anyone at all  
Can you finally hear this deep in  
Scratching through the wall  
Came far to find me  
Down the rabbit hole  
Watch me smiling back while chewing on my skull  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
Is the monkey breathing  
Looking kinda sick  
Got a witty comment for me  
Have yourself a kick  
Does it make you feel good  
Are you full and strong  
Gonna end up in this cage and I hope your stay is long  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before  
  
Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before  
  
Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry
