When was the last time  
You called me on the phone?  
Said you love me  
And said you needed me  
When was it? Oh baby  
  
It was yesterday  
That I could hide in your arms  
You spoke those those lovely words  
That you want me  
Was that true? I wanna know  
  
Chorus:  
I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent  
But all I have left is sadness and misery  
Those fond memories have left me  
Stripped and I'm in agony  
So why you do this to me?  
  
It seems like I've trusted you  
Broken and torn are my heart when I finally see  
You and her staying around that corner  
Whispers of love have left me so alone  
Did you truly love me?  
  
Just the other day  
I saw another her  
She n you in a bus sharing every pleasant thing in the world  
I was so emotional I wanted to see you so much  
But now it seems that all is gone  
I guess I must move on  
  
Chorus  
  
How can a boy like you act like a man?  
Come back my darlin' and i'll gif you all the happiness  
I love you  
You know its true  
Come back please come back...
