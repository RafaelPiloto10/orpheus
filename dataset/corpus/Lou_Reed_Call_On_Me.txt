Caught in the crossbow of ideas and journeys  
Sit here reliving the other self's mournings  
Caught in the crossbow of ideas and dawnings  
Stand I  
  
Reliving the past of the maddening impulse  
The violent upheaval  
The pure driven instinct  
The pure driven murder  
The attraction of daring  
Stand I  
  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call  
  
A wild being from birth  
My spirit spurns control  
Wandering the wide earth  
Searching for my soul  
Dimly peering  
I would surely find  
What could there be more purely bright  
In truth's day-star  
  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call  
  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call on me  
Why didn't you call
