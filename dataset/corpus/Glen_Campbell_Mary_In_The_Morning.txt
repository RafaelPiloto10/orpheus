Nothing's quite as pretty, as Mary in the morning  
When through a sleepy haze, I see her lyin' there  
Soft as the rain, that falls on summer flowers  
Warm as the sunlight, shinin' on her golden hair  
Mmm-hmmm  
  
When I awake, and see her there so close besi-ide me  
I want to take, her in my arms, the ache is there  
So deep insi-ide me  
  
And nothing's quite as pretty, as Mary in the morning  
Chasin' a rainbow in her dream so far away  
And when she turns to touch it, I kiss her face so softly  
And my Mary wakes to love another day  
Mmm-hmmm  
  
My Mary's there, in sunny days or stormy wea-eather  
She doesn't care, 'cause right or wrong the love we share  
We share toge-ether  
  
And nothing's quite as pretty, as Mary in the evening  
Kissed by the shades of night and starlight on her hair  
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me  
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share  
Mmm-hmmm  
  
Nothing's quite as pretty, as Mary in the morning  
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning (fade)
