All last night we lay in bed making love  
I never felt so much before with anyone  
Never had to say a word  
It was all right there  
The warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere  
  
And if I never have another love  
Well at least I had last night  
Now I know how the feeling grows  
Cause you made me come alive  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I only want to give you more  
  
Now you're gone, I'm all alone just lying here  
Waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near  
Never asked if you'd come back,  
I was too damn proud  
I just smile and touched your hair  
As you went out  
  
[Chorus]
