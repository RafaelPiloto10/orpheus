High on a mountain in western Montana  
A silhouette moves across a cinnamon sky  
Riding along on a horse he calls Music  
With a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye  
  
He dreams of a time, and a lady that loved him  
And how he would sing her sweet lullaby's  
But we don't ever ask him, and he never talks about her  
I guess its just better that we all let it slide  
  
[Chorus]  
And he sings ooh to the ladies  
And ooh he makes 'em sigh  
Then he rides away on a horse he calls Music  
With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye  
  
Now he rode the Music from Boston to Bozman  
For not too much money, and way too much ride  
But those were the days when a horse he called Music  
Could jump through the moon and scale across the sky  
  
Now all that's left is an old time worn cowboy  
With only his dreams of the days long gone by  
And trailin' behind is a horse with no rider  
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
High on a mountain in western Montana  
Two crossed cut through a cinnamon sky  
Marking the place where a horse he called Music  
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet by and by
