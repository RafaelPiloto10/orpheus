Here I am flying  
Looking down at mother earth below  
Above me only blue skies  
Below me is a cotton candy world  
Here I am dreaming  
Plane I'm on flies gently as a bird  
Captain said something  
But I never heard single word  
Here I am flying  
Look above you  
I'll be watching you  
Maybe you won't see me  
But soon I'll be flying  
Soon I'll be flying home to you  
Gazing at the sunrise  
Homeland sure looks green far down below  
Now we're almost landed  
I can see the hostess by the door  
Here I am flying  
Look above you  
I'll be watching you  
Maybe you won't see me  
But soon I'll be flying  
Soon I'll be flying home to you  
Won't be long 'till I see  
Bridges on our river  
Looking at the old familiar lights  
Won't be long 'till we'll be  
Making up for countless sleepless nights  
Here I am flying  
Looking down at mother earth below  
Above me only blue skies  
Below me is a cotton candy world  
Here I am flying  
Look above you  
I'll be watching you  
Maybe you won't see me  
But soon I'll be flying  
Soon I'll be flying home to you
