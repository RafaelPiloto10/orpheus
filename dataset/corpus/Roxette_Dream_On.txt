Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And it's clear  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
She never shoots her gun  
She only keeps it just for fun  
I wanna call her bluff  
But I never get close enough  
Though I love to hear her heartbeat  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And it's clear  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
Eighteen times today  
I've been wishin' my day away  
And it's hard to say  
If I'm windin' up ok  
But I pray I'll hear her heartbeat  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And outta year  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
In my ear I hear the heartbeat  
In my ear I hear the heartbeat  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And it's clear  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And outta year  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
It might be a tear  
It might be a tear
