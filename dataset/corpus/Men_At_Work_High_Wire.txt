Feel so washed up today  
Haven't really got much to say  
  
Blood on the pillow of my bed  
Explains the pain that's in my head  
  
Sometimes I don't know which way to go  
Sometimes I can't tell, but it's just as well  
'cause I'm walking on a high wire  
High wire  
  
Oh won't someone let me in  
I'm stinking and I'm full of gin  
No need to close the door so fast  
I'm very fragile not built to last  
  
Sometimes I don't know which way to go  
Sometimes I can't tell  
But it's just as well  
'cause I'm walking on a high wire  
Diving through the ring of fire  
High wire  
  
Have to pull it together  
We're in for some stormy weather  
Have to pull it together  
We're in for some nasty weather  
High wire, high wire  
  
It really isn't too much fun  
Sitting round waiting for the night to come  
It's almost time to put on my suit of cool  
I may be an idiot but indeed I am no fool  
  
Sometimes I don't know which way to go  
Someties I can't tell but it's just as well  
'Cause I'm walking on a high wire
