You don't have to come with me  
Down this road  
'Cause I know my way around here  
Very well  
It may not seem like it  
From where you stand  
But believe you me  
I know what I'm talking about  
Letting it all go  
Didn't matter to me  
'Cause I've done it all before  
  
But when you left  
Part of me went with you  
That is why I call you now  
On this phone  
So please, oh please  
Don't hang up on me  
  
Release me, let me go  
Release me, let me go  
Release me, let me go  
But remember that  
Some bridges never burn  
  
You took your way  
And I took mine  
We were sure our ways  
Will never meet again  
Every time I go out  
With another man  
I find myself calling your name  
Now I know that it's true  
  
What they say  
Sometimes love  
Never knows when to die  
When you went  
Part of me went with you  
That's why I called you on the phone  
  
Release me, let me go  
Remember that  
Some bridges never burn
