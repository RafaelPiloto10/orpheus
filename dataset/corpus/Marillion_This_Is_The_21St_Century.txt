(...If you could only see what I've seen with your eyes)  
  
A wise man once said  
A flower is only  
A sexual organ  
Beauty is cruelty  
And evolution  
A wise man once said  
that everything could be explained with mathematics  
He had denied  
His feminine side  
Now where is the wisdom in that?  
  
I came just as fast as I could  
Through the dirty air  
Of your neighbourhood  
Your name on a grain of rice  
Hangin' around my neck  
And a head like lead  
  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
The Universe demystified  
Chemicals for God  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
  
A wise man once wrote  
That love is only  
An ancient instinct  
For reproduction  
Natural selection  
A wise man once said  
That everything could be explained  
And it's all in the brain  
  
We lay on a velvet rug  
by the open fire  
She blew air on my eyelids  
I cried "What's it all about?"  
As she kissed my hair  
She said "There, there.."  
  
"This is the 21st century  
I heard everything you said  
The universe demystified  
Astronomy instead  
This is the 21st century  
Can't you get it through your head  
This ain't the way it was meant to be  
Magic isn't dead  
Come to bed  
Come to bed  
  
And rest your heavy head my love.."  
And slowly, from above,  
She showed the answer's something that can't be written down  
  
This is the 21st century  
Flash to crash and burn  
Nobody's gonna give you anything  
For nothing in return  
There's a man up in a mirrored building  
And he just bought the world  
  
Would you want  
To have kids  
Growing up  
Into what's left of this?  
  
She shook her head,  
She said "Can't you see?  
The world is you  
The world is me."
