We got our eyes wide open and feeling like we are almost there.  
Words unspoken disappearing in the air  
All I see is you and I  
You're the only lifeline, that I need tonight  
I'm letting go.  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place, the right time  
I'm bringing off a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night  
This is why we came, yeah I can feel it in my veins hey yeah  
So this is what it feels like  
Right place the right time  
  
Loud explosions only you and I can hear  
Doors fly open, you're the cure for all my fears  
All I see is you and I  
You're the only lifeline, that I need tonight  
I'm letting go.  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place, the right time  
I'm hanging off a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night  
This is why we came, yeah I can feel it in my veins  
So this is what it feels like  
Right place the right time, with you  
Right place the right time, with you  
Right place the right time  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Never touch the ground when we're together  
Right here and now feels like forever, forever, forever, forever  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place, the right time  
I'm hanging of a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night.  
Right place the right time  
Right place the right time  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Never touch the ground when we are together  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Right place the right time
