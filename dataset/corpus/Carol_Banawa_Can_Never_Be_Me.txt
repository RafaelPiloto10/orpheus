You're always there for me  
You pick me up when I'm down  
Ever so willing to guide me  
Giving me unconditional love  
Sometimes I refuse to listed  
But I know you're so right  
You only want good things in my life  
I may not say that much  
But how I love you  
And I can only thank God  
For giving me to you  
I can't imagine my world  
Without you, without you  
  
Chorus:  
You've given me life love  
And my heart and my soul  
You taught me kindness  
And compassion  
You let my goodness flow  
You're the constant guiding light  
That shines one me  
And without you  
I can never be me  
  
Ever since I was a child  
I see you so strong  
You're the one that I run to  
When things go wrong  
You're never tires of loving me  
You're always there to take good care of me  
  
Everything good about me  
Is all because of you...  
(Repeat Chorus)
