Fly don't fly on me,  
fly around somebody new.  
Fly don't fly on me,  
your buzzing and your humming is making me blue.  
I can't sleep at night,  
I toss and turn with all of my might,  
knowing you are there,  
you'll take my dreams and turn my dreams into a nightmare.  
When I go to sleep  
I don't count the sheep,  
I just think about my sweetie-pie.  
Then you fly on me,  
oh what misery.  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
you mess me up and wake me up so I wanna cry.  
  
Fly don't fly on me,  
fly so I can dream all night.  
Fly don't fly on me  
and when you go away I'll see her holding me tight,  
'cause in my dreams I know she's gonna treat me so right.

Fly don't fly on me, shoo..........  
Fly don't fly on me, shoo............
