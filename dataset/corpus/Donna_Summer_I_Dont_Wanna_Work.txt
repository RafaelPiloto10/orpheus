Well I give it little care  
Does anybody out there even know  
I'm in here?  
I just keep my movement going  
Somewhere  
Like playing in the background baby  
Like playing in the background baby  
  
I play the game  
You play the way that most men would choose  
I'm surprised at you  
Way back in the middle of a broken down love affair  
You and I found each other  
And we fell in love  
I ain't never met a man and woman get along better  
Than you and I when get together  
Still I say  
I don't wanna work that hard  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no  
  
See the lady walking down the street  
She's got on high heel shoes  
And her hair full of curlers  
She's got stiletto nails  
And some black mascara  
She's got a push up and a pick up  
I tell you that girl's working overtime  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no no no no no  
I don't wanna work  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work it if makes me cry  
  
Spent last night  
Talking to myself in bed  
Wondering why I do this over  
Over and over again  
I don't know  
I, I, I, I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not when it makes me cry  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work not that hard  
I don't wanna work it it makes me cry  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work not that hard  
I don't wanna work if it makes me cry
