If I don't get a letter from Sue tomorrow I'm a catch the next eastbound je-
je-je-jet  
I done write her four wrotes now in a row and I ain't got nare a heard ye-ye-
ye-yet  
  
I writ Sue an' told her if I don't see somethin' soon  
I'm a-have ta start sneckin' in d-d-d-d-d-d-doors  
She writ back and sey, if you don't send somethin' soon  
I'm a-have to sell somethin' of y-y-y-y-y-yours  
  
Sue don't allow me to m-m-mess around  
She say the folks back home begin to t-t-t-t-talk  
I got to get my reputation b-b-back again  
And settle down and start walkin' the ch-ch-ch-ch-chalk  
  
What be lookin' good to d'goose  
Is gotta be groovy to d'g-g-g-g-gand  
Two birdies in a bush ain't worth as much as one  
Twitchin' right there in yo' h-h-hand  
  
I sent Sue somethin' so I b-b-be safe  
She writ and sey I mighty nigh b-b-b-blew it  
It won't matter which one wh-what you do  
It b-be's in the way dat you d-d-d-d-d-do it
