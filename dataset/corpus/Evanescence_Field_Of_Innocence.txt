I still remember the world  
From the eyes of a child  
Slowly those feelings  
Were clouded by what I know now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
An uneven trade for the real world  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all  
  
I still remember the sun  
Always warm on my back  
Somehow it seems colder now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything
