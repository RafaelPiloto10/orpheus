She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel  
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot  
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now  
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought  
But you're caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Writing your own headlines  
Ignoring your own deadlines  
But now you've gotta' write them all again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x2]  
You want her, confront her, just open your window  
Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch  
You want it, confront it, just open your window  
All you really have to do is ask  
But you're caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Timing your contractions  
Inventing small contraptions  
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors  
  
[Chorus[  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x2]  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x3]
