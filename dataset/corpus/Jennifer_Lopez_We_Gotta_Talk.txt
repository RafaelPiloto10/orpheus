The way you looked at me  
Tells me you're sorry  
You walked by me  
Whispering you love me  
When I tried to hold (you) tight  
You pulled away  
But you wanted me to stay  
Instead you ran away  
Baby, talk to me let's stop playing games  
Don't turn away from me  
Just look me straight in the eyes  
Don't try to sweet talk me  
  
With those nasty words you say  
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel  
  
Ooh baby, come and talk to me  
Together we can work this out  
We gotta love thing  
We're talking about  
  
The way you tricked me  
You know that wasn't right, ooh  
You tried to hit me  
There's no need to fight  
Because I gave you everything  
I had to give  
If you know it's worth the fight  
We gotta compromise  
Baby, talk to me  
And tell me what's wrong  
Come sit down next to me  
And let me feel the vibe you on  
'Cause everything will be alright  
But we must communicate  
Tomorrow it could be too late  
  
'Cause I love you boy  
And I (you) need you (me) here (too)  
Together we can make this thing work out  
  
To think about  
What we could miss  
You cry like this  
'Cause every time  
I taste your kiss  
It makes me want to lose my mind  
Ooh, baby, come and talk to me  
Together we can work this out  
We gotta love thing  
We're talking about
