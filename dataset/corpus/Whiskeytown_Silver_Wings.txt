Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
They're taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
They're taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Don't leave me I cry  
Don't take that airplane ride  
But you lock me outta your mind  
Left me standing here behind  
Silver wings shining in the sunlight  
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight  
They're taking you away  
Leaving me lonely  
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight  
Slowly fading out of sight  
Slowly fading out of sight
