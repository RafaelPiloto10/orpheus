Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time  
So let the punishment fit the crime  
It's under the table  
Under your skin  
Into the cable  
Is this the death of the glory you're in?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black sails in the sunset  
White noise going yakety-yak  
All the money in the world will never bring your body back  
Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do?  
Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly  
I don't have a clue  
Oooh  
  
You're Cinderella with a ball and chain  
And the shoe seems to fit you  
You tell the truth sometimes but  
You wouldn't know it if it hit you  
Is this some new trick  
Wired up in your head?  
Do you make me sick  
Or was I just force fed?  
  
[Chorus]
