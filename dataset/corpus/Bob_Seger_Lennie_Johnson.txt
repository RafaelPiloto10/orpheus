Here we go tape rolling  
Sgt. Pepper take 6  
  
He doesn't know which way to go  
Even though he's made the dough  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
He's lost his mind  
??????????????  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
  
He spent his time with words of rhyme  
He's rang the chime  
We must find  
  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
He's lost his mind  
He had it yesterday  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
  
An apple a day keeps the doctor away  
I've heard them say  
Not today
