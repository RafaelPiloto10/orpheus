I told you from the start I couldn't give you my heart it belonged to someone
else  
I tried like hell but still we fell I guess we could not help ourselves  
You sure felt good in my world little girl but it's time to draw the line  
Cause there's a lady who's mine and she's not the kind to just die upon the
vine  
Rose knows something's going on Rose knows she's spending too much time alone  
I suppose better get myself back home Rose knows something's going on  
  
I'd love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time  
I wish it could be but unfortunately I've got roses on my mind  
Rose knows something's going on  
Rose knows something's going on
