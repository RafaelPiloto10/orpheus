In the middle of the night  
I had a vision  
It was bigger than life  
Standing on the edge of my bed  
She said "come here, don't be afraid"  
Her tongue opened like a shot  
Oh bang bang  
Ten feet tall, laser eyes  
Killer body, killer thighs  
She drew me a fine line  
What's wrong what's right  
I didn't know what to think  
She seemed to know what to drink  
I was stunned by her gun  
Couldn't walk, couldn't run  
Well she drew me a picture  
And it seemed so true  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
She's lookin' right through my eyes  
  
Love is passin' by  
Right before my eyes  
And I'm wondering why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Right here in my face  
I had a vision  
That was bigger than life  
Oh connie likes nighttime, every night  
Connie likes candy, every bite  
All day sucker, connie might  
Swallow that thing 'cause she does it right  
  
I'm weak in the knees  
I'm beggin' you please  
Just ask for more  
She just wants affection  
My soldier's at attention  
No I don't know  
Why you're doin this to me  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
She's lookin' right through my eyes  
  
Love is passin' by  
Right before my eyes  
And I'm wondering why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Well she told me  
In the biblical sense  
And she told me  
In the strictest confidence  
  
She told me  
We were worlds apart  
She told me, she told me  
I don't know why I'm here  
She said, "don't be afraid"  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
You're lookin' right through my eyes  
Standing on the edge  
Light flashes before my eyes  
Standing on the edge  
And watchin' my world crash by  
Love is passing by  
Right before my eyes  
And I wonder why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
I'm standing on the edge
