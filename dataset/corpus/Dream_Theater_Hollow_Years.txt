He's just the kind of man  
You hear about  
Who leaves his family for  
An easy out  
They never saw the signs  
He never said a word  
He couldn't take another day  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your head disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years  
  
She's not the kind of girl  
You hear about  
She'll never want another  
She'll never be without  
She'll give you all the signs  
She'll tell you everything  
Then turn around and walk away  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your heads disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your heads disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years
