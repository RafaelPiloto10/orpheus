Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you  
Peopled called you, said 'beware the doll, you're bound to fall',  
You thought they were all kidding you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody else that was hanging out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
In no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Like a rolling stone
