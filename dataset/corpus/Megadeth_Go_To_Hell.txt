Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
If I should die before I wake  
I pray the lord my soul to take  
I'm not going to wake up today  
They've pulled my plug the picture fades  
And as my body decays  
Mold begins to fill my grave  
The smell of death permeates  
The silk within my coffin lays  
Go to hell!  
As they bury me now  
Six feet there my body lies  
Still feel like I'm going down  
I hear a distant wailing cry  
God something must've gone wrong  
And much too late I realize  
Go to hell!  
I saw my funeral that day  
I know who didn't show to mourn  
My judgment was life in hell  
Pillars of pain and thorns  
My only friend's the goat  
With 666 between his horns  
Go to hell!  
Place all your trust here in me  
Rest assured these things I know  
And as Charon sails the sea  
Your journey too shall end below  
Ah yes, you're all sitting ducks  
It's true you reap what you sow  
Go to hell!  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep  
If I die before I wake  
I'll go to Hell for Heaven's sake
