I want to watch you drown in your lies.  
The end of your masquerade, a matter of time  
Interwining lies, domination, control  
Feed his twisted nature  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice, fate's patience is growning short.  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy  
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner  
These four words my friend, I promise you will not forget  
  
I am one of many that see through your lies  
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge.  
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create, and cannot have.  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice, fate's patience is growning short.  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy
