Blue smoke goes drifting by  
  
Into the deep blue sky  
  
And when I think of home  
  
I sadly sigh  
  
  
  
Oh I can see you there  
  
With loving tears in your eyes  
  
As we finally said our last good byes  
  
  
  
And as I sailed away with a longing to stay  
  
I promised I'd be true and love only you  
  
  
  
Blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky  
  
My memories of home will never die  
  
  
  
Blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky  
  
My memories of home will never die
