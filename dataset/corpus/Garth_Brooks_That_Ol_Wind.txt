She dropped her boy at school on time  
One less worry on her mind  
Now it's off to work and on the radio  
Come's an old familiar song  
And then the D.J.'s voice comes on  
And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show.  
  
Her eyes well up with tears  
God could it be it's been ten years  
Since that Autumn night outside the county fair  
When two strangers shared a night  
And in the darkness found a light  
That to this day is still alive and burning there.  
  
He asked her twice to come along  
They said good-bye at the break of dawn  
'Cause you can't hold back the wind  
If it's meant to be again  
Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms.  
  
The marquee misspelled his name  
And not too many people came  
But that didn't matter to them  
They laughed and loved all through the night  
And as they faced the morning light  
They found themselves standing there again.  
  
And he asked her twice to come along  
They said good-bye at the break of dawn  
As his bus left out she cried  
With him standing by her side  
That ol' wind had once again found it's way home.  
Someday he'll tell her about the money he hid  
And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid.  
But for right now they're both in love  
The only thing they're thinkin' of  
Is that they're finally where their hearts have always been.
