As the sun goes down on the arizona plain  
and the wind whistles by like a runaway train  
hey hey hey it's a beautiful thing  
well it's me and you and a flatbed truck  
my heart kicking over like a whitetail buck  
hey hey hey in the middle of spring  
  
You can cut me deep  
you can cut me down  
you can cut me loose  
don't you know it's okay  
you can kick and scream  
you can slap my face  
you can set my wheels on a high speed chase  
hey no matter what you do  
  
Wild horses could not drag me away from you  
Wild horses could not drag me away from you  
  
As the sky falls down from the midnight blue  
spittin' like bullets on a hot tin roof  
hey hey hey it's a beautiful sound  
well it's me and you in a flatbed truck  
in a foot of mud just my luck  
hey hey hey a hundred miles out of town  
  
You can call me a fool  
you can call me blind  
you can call it quits  
can't hear a word you say  
cause if I had you once  
I'm gonna have you twice  
I'm gonna follow my heart instead of good advice  
hey no matter what you do  
  
Wild horses could not drag me away from you  
Wild horses could not drag me away from you
