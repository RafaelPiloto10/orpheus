I want to  
I want to be someone else or I'll explode  
Floatin' upon this surface for the birds,  
The birds  
The birds  
  
You want me?  
Fuckin' well, come and find me.  
I'll be waitin'  
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches,  
And nothin'  
Nothin'  
Nothin'  
  
You want me?  
Well, come and break the door down.  
You want me?  
Fuckin' come and break the door down.  
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,  
I'm ready,  
I'm ready
