My morning starts to shine with teardrops in my eyes  
And here I am alone starting to realize  
That my days would be brighter, if I could learn to hide  
The feelings that I have for you keep hurtin me inside  
  
Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you  
Hoping my tomorrow would be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all I need is you  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you, you will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true, my love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end with just one wish that's you  
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through  
Cause the pain that's inside me, would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me and promise me you'd stay  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you, you will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true, my love will always be with you  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you, you will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
(Ooh) This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
My love will always  
My love will always ooh, ooh  
My love will always be with you  
Be with you
