Can't you see I'm shaking in my shoes  
I've done everything but I still got the blues  
Everywhere I turn there's misery  
Stuck in the middle of nowhere street  
  
Go away come back where ya goin'  
Don't do that, do this, don't you blow it  
Run don't walk, shout don't talk about it  
You don't know anything about it  
  
It's no good there's no way out  
No way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
There's no doubt  
That there's no way out, no way out  
  
She left some money in a paper sack  
And a note to say she ain't coming back  
It's no good there's no way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
But there's no way out, no way out  
  
They're coming at me from everywhere  
They say she's already gone from here  
  
Go away come back where ya goin'  
Don't do that, do this, don't you blow it  
Run don't walk, shout don't talk about it  
You don't know anything about it  
  
It's no good there's no way out  
No way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
That there's no way out, no way out  
  
No way out  
No way out  
No way out  
No way out
