They call to her from across the street  
But they don't know her name  
She's in the wrong place at the wrong time  
Who's to blame  
  
She wonders how to change  
the life she's living  
She wonders if she'll ever get away  
As far as I can see, the writing's on the wall  
  
There's no return, we live, we learn  
The game goes on and on and  
Que sera  
I like you but I don't  
  
Really want to take you home  
Que sera  
It's a lonely life  
Living on my own  
  
Que sera  
What's it gonna be, what's it gonna be  
She left her home when she was seventeen  
Simply disappeared in the rain  
  
Those were bad times so it was high time  
She knows she'd do it again  
She wonders how  
she's gonna make a living  
  
She wonders if she'll make it through the day  
As far as I can see, I've seen it all before  
A lonely girl in a big bad world  
The game goes on and on and  
  
Que sera
