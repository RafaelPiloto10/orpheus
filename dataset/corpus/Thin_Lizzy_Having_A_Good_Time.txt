Me and my buddies, we're going to get drunk  
We're going to go out on the town  
We'll be checking it out, slipping it in  
And stepping out of line  
You know everybody likes to get a little crazy  
In their own particular way  
But my buddies and I, we go over the top  
And we're going over again today  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
You know it's a rock and roll pastime  
  
It might be typical, topical or maybe tropical  
That doesn't mean anything  
If you're political, practical  
Then it's improbable that you do anything  
But me and my buddies, we like to go crazy  
We like to go over the hill  
Hey, woman, will you be there? Because my buddies and I will  
  
Having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
We'll be having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
"Hey, snowy, play a bit for me  
That was snowy white  
And he likes err it in the night  
The next to play  
I must say, is Scott Gorham  
And away"  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
Let's play that one more time  
Hit me with that drum, Brian  
Hit me as hard as you can  
Oh yes, that's they way I like it  
Do it again, do it again, let's do it again  
  
Having a good time  
Oh yes, I like this  
Having a good time  
Typical, topical, who cares?  
Having a good time  
Political, practical, impossible  
Having a good time  
  
Don't ask me why, Jack  
Having a good time  
Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!  
Having a good time  
Having a wild time  
Having a good time  
I'm slipping on the inside  
Having a good time  
That's fine, having a good time  
Having a good time  
Drinking Beaujolais  
No, that doesn't rhyme  
Having a good time  
I'm talking from the top of my head  
Having a good time  
To the bottom of your soul
