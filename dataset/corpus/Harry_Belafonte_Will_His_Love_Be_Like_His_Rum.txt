Will his love be like his rum,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
Intoxicating all night long,  
Yes it will, yes it will, everybody,  
  
Drink, drink this toast,  
Drink this wedding toast,  
Drink oh drink this toast,  
To the two we love the most,  
  
Did he wed her in the spring,  
Yes he did, yes he did,  
Did he give her finger ring,  
Yes he did, yes he did,  
  
Will her cooking be the best,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
Make his belly split his best,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
  
Will she be a perfect wife,  
Yes she will, yes she will,  
Make him work hard all his life,  
Yes she will, yes she will,  
  
Will we dance and sing all night-a,  
Yes we will, yes we will,  
Eat up everything inside,  
Yes we will, yes we will
