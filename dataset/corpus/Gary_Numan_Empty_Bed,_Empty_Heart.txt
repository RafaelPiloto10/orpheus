You let me down  
How cold love can be  
I've nothing more to lose  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I don't sleep without you  
Empty bed, empty heart  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and I'll wait for you  
Years and years and years  
How strange love can be  
It bends and tears and screams  
But only here inside me  
But only here inside me  
I don't live without you  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm waiting always waiting  
I'm waiting oh but don't leave me now  
I'm here forever  
You don't come  
You don't come forever
