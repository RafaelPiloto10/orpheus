Yo Paul  
It's Em  
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing  
And I know he's not thrilled about the video  
What, does he want to be startin' somethin'  
I'll show him who's really bad (burp!)  
Paul the way you make me feel with these calls  
You should take a look at the man in  
The mirror and tell him to beat it 'cause  
I won't stop 'till I get enough  
Do you remember the time  
We were watching the "Billie Jean" Video?  
Well he'll always be that Michael to me  
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white  
'Cause I can't stop loving him and I,  
Hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking  
Die  
How do you like that?  
I like  
I like him a lot  
I want to touch him  
But I can't  
Excuse me I'm taking a shit, sorry  
But anyways call me back I have an idea about  
How I want to end the show  
So page me when you get this message, fucker  
Oh and by the way and no I don't have a new gun  
God dammit
