You treated me like a doggone dog for so long  
But I went along to keep peace in our home  
But there's some things that I just won't do  
I think it's time that I told them to you  
I don't do windows and I won't go to hell for you  
  
Although honey, hell is what you put me through  
I'll do the clothes if you won't come unglued  
And I'll clean the stove to keep you in a good mood  
But you've been mean to me sometime  
I think I better tell you what's on my mind  
I don't do windows and I don't come to work 'til nine  
And if you make me mad, I won't come to work any time  
  
I want Sundays off so I can go out and play golf with all the boys  
Honey, I'm tired of being just one of your toys  
And there's one more thing that you don't understand  
I wanna be treated like a natural man  
I don't do windows and I don't play second hands  
I said I don't do windows and I won't play second fiddle in your band
