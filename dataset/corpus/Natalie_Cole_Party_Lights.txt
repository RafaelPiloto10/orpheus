I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Make me feel all right  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Really out of sight  
  
I see reflections going in the air  
Telling me the way to move  
I feel the spirit and it's everywhere  
Telling me it's time to groove  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Make me feel all right  
Mm, yeah  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Really out of sight  
  
I must get out  
I'm going crazy here  
The time has come for me to say  
  
Goodbye to all the  
Things I used to fear  
So long to lonely yesterday  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Make me feel all right  
  
Oh, I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Really out of sight  
  
Whoa, oh, come on  
Party with me, children  
Come on, party with me  
Down, get down, get down  
Come on, party with me  
Down, get down  
  
I see the party lights  
They're shining in the night  
Ooh, make me feel all right  
Oh, really feel right, yeah  
  
I see the party lights  
They're shining in the night  
Can't you see them, out of sight  
  
Whoa, oh  
I've got to leave here  
And I won't look back, no, no  
I'll sing tomorrow with the sky  
  
Yes, I have, I've got the  
Sunshine in a paper sack  
Would you believe  
I've got new wings and I can fly  
  
I see the party lights  
They're shining in the night  
Ooh, make me feel all right  
I feel all right  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Really out of sight  
Let's get away, let's go  
  
Come on, party with me, children  
Hey, come on, party with me  
Down, get down, get down  
Come on, party with me, children  
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me  
Down, get down, get down  
  
Come on, party with me, children  
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me  
Down, get down, get down, get down  
Come on, party with me, children  
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me  
Oh, oh, oh, ho ha  
  
Party, party, party  
Party hard, party, oh  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Ooh, make me feel all right  
Can't you see them  
Can't you see them  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Ooh, yeah, out of sight  
  
I see the party lights  
Shining in the night  
Oh, feel all right  
Let's go, come on  
  
Party lights, let's go, yeah  
In the night out of sight  
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, yeah  
  
Party lights  
Shining in the night  
Just for me, feel all right  
Well, oh, oh  
  
Party lights  
Shining in the night  
Out of sight
