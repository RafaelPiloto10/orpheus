I shot some dope, I feel so sick  
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick  
Drugs and bitches and junkies and fags  
Artificial phonies I hate it, hate it  
  
Sick, sick, sick, it's the price I pay  
It's a sick world, what can I say?  
(Bullshit scum, they're all ingrates)  
They steal, they cheat, they take take take  
  
Wart, Wart Hog

Wart, Wart Hog

I want to puke, I can't sit still  
(There's sex and drugs in a nightmare world)  
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick  
It's a hopeless life, I hate it, hate it  
  
It's the drugs and the lies and the ripoff bet?  
Drugs and bitches and commies and queers  
Artificial phonies, I hate it, hate it
