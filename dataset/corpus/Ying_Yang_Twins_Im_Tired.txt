  
[D-Roc]  
Walkin' round' town like I'm lost, sittin' in da house like a log  
Nigga had to find somethin' out, playa want to shine das all  
Don't help to twine wit' mine so small  
Nigga nigga nigga nigga please, hataz all around me let a nigga breathe  
What a nigga say at the slip of the lip?  
Man fuck dat bitch need to quit, talk about a nigga like a hoe  
What they want to hate me fo?  
When a nigga step through da doe' conversation get low  
With these type of niggas I don't need no communication  
'cause' playahation das so irrelavent next motherfucker that hate  
I'm thinkin' bout' writin' a letter to da president  
Swimmin' in da land of da lost, nigga don't sleep too good  
Nigga tired been all off from stress dat can will, would, should  
Probably could make a nigga ass go insane  
Stay smoked out all day mary jane, niggas be tryin' to make me  
Strain, hataz want to put a chain on my rang  
Get a nigga mind off track and worry bout' you givin' my shit back  
All ova hea need to stay ova dea, you got yo' own stay outta my hair  
Niggas and bitches is both da same they lie, steal, cheat, fuck, suck,  
Trick, and all dis then they in yo' face wit' dat I love shit  
[Chorus]  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
Fake booty, boot busta ass niggas all around me

Niggas get gone uh, bitches get gone uh (x2)  
[Kaine]  
Muthafuckas come around my face, mouf got a bad ass taste  
Why the motherfuckers want to hate?  
Need to get out my way, let a motherfucker come through  
Do wha tha fuck I gotta do, dis don't concern you  
I'm tryin' to handle my business, get on da good foot  
You need to jump on da band wagon and not stand backin'  
'cause' errbody tryin' to get rich, buy a new house and shit  
Make our way out da hood, like everybody should  
But you up to no good tryin' to bring a nigga down  
Spreadin' lies around town nigga like a fu-ckin clown  
It only make you look bad, errbody jokin' yo' ass  
It just make me laugh, make a nigga move on, made me write dis song  
Now I'm in the fuckin' zone, tha list goes on and on  
But they say two wrongs dat don't make no right  
It just make it worst, I addressed it first  
That's why I wrote this verse, probably say da truth hurt  
I'm bout' tired of dis shit, ya need to let da shit go  
Quit actin' like a fuckin' hoe, yeah it's time to grow  
If you do it will show  
[Chorus]  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
Fake booty, boot busta ass niggas all around me  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
Hoes, hoes, hoes is all I see  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
Won't chall get da fuck on and leave me alone  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
Niggas get gone uh, bitches get gone uh (x4)  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
I'm ttiiirreedddd  
I'm ttiiirreedddd
