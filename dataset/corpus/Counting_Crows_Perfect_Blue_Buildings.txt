Just down the street from your hotel, baby  
I stay at home with my disease  
And ain't this position familiar, darling  
Well, all monkeys do what they see  
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...  
  
Down on Virginia and La Loma  
Where I got friends who'll care for me  
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted  
I got an attitude of need  
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion  
Try to keep myself away from me  
  
It's 4:30 A.M. on a Tuesday  
It doesn't get much worse than this  
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle  
of these lives which are completely meaningless  
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion  
Try to keep myself away from myself and me  
  
I got bones beneath my skin, and mister...  
There's a skeleton in every man's house  
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody  
There's a dead man trying to get out  
Please help me stay awake, I'm falling...  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion baby  
Try to keep myself away from me
