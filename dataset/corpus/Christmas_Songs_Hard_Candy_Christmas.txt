Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair  
Maybe I'll move somewhere  
Maybe I'll get a car  
Maybe I'll drive so far  
They'll all lose track  
Me, I'll bounce right back  
Maybe I'll sleep real late  
Maybe I'll lose some weight  
Maybe I'll clear my junk  
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and Dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow get me way down  
  
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew  
Maybe I'll just lie low  
Maybe I'll hit the bars  
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn  
Me, I will go on  
  
Maybe I'll settle down  
Maybe I'll just leave town  
Maybe I'll have some fun  
Maybe I'll meet someone  
And make him mine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
'Cause I'll be fine  
(I'll be fine)  
Oh, I'll be fine
