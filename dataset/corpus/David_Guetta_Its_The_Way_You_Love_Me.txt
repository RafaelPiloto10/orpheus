Late at night I lose my focus  
Late at night I'm calling out for you  
It can't be right I got no focus  
I hope you noticed  
  
The chemistry is off the radar  
Look at me I don't know what to do  
This chemistry is off the radar  
Let me see you later  
  
Over and over you run in my mind  
Give me one look and you know I'm fine  
Can't you see we're only wasting our time  
Baby thought you understood  
  
It's the way you look, me  
It's the way you move, me  
And the way you touch, me  
It's the way you love, me  
  
What's the point? I can't remember  
Where's the key? Well give it up to me  
You got me boy and I surrender  
Lets get you back to my  
  
Over and over you run in my mind  
Give me one look and you know I'm fine  
Can't you see we're only wasting our time  
Baby thought you understood  
  
It's the way you look, me  
It's the way you move, me  
And the way you touch, me  
It's the way you love, me  
  
Baby it's simple to see  
Baby it's simple  
This is where I'm meant to be  
This is where I'm meant to be  
  
You stole a piece of my heart  
You stole a piece of my heart baby  
You're making me start all over  
  
It's the way you love, me  
And the way you move, me  
  
It's the way you love, me  
And the way you move, me  
And the way you touch, me  
It's the way you love, me  
And the way you love  
  
Every little thing you do  
Everything that you do  
You can put me in the mood  
You put me in the mood  
  
Now I'm looking straight at you  
You're looking at me too  
Yeah you know what I want from you!
