I went down to Captain Tony's  
To get out of the heat  
I heard a voice call out to me  
"Son come have a seat"  
I had to search my memory  
As I looked into those eyes  
Our lives changed like the weather  
But a legend never dies  
  
[Chorus]  
He said I ate the last mango in Paris  
I took the last plane out of Saigon  
Took the first fast boat to China  
And Jimmy there's still so much to be done  
I had a third world girl in Buzios  
With a pistol in each hand  
  
She always kept me covered  
As we moved from land to land  
I had a damn good run on Wall Street  
With my high fashion model wife  
I woke up dry beneath the African sky  
Just me and my Swiss Army knife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We shot the breeze for hours  
As the sun fell from the sky  
And like the sun he disappeared  
Before my very eyes  
It was somewhere past dark-thirty  
As I went back to the head  
I read upon the dingy walls  
The words the old man said  
  
[Chorus: x2]
