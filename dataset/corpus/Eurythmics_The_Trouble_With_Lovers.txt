The trouble with lovers  
They don't know how to say no  
The trouble with lovers  
They don't know when to let go  
They drink too much coffee  
Smoke too many cigarettes  
Stay up all night to  
Watch Woody Allen  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all they're after  
  
And God only knows  
I'd like to be there too  
With Jackie Onassis  
But if not then maybe you  
The trouble with lovers  
The trouble with lovers  
  
The trouble with us is  
We don't give each other a chance  
The trouble with us is  
We're living in cloud Disneyland  
We try to be happy  
We're never happy  
Try not to argue  
Then start to argue  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all we're after  
  
And God only knows  
I want to be with you  
But Jackie Onassis  
Will probably be there too  
The trouble with us is  
The trouble with us is  
  
Let's put on our raincoats  
And walk through the rainy day blue  
Go searching for something  
Without really having a clue  
We'll drink too much coffee  
Eat too much chocolate  
Watch Thirtysomething  
Never stop laughing  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all we're after  
  
And God only knows  
God only knows  
  
The trouble with lovers (I want to be with you)  
  
The trouble with lovers  
The trouble with lovers
