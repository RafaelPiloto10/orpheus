Can you answer me?  
No more time for questioning  
My car's outside I want to leave  
Don't you think I'm interesting  
Well, I'm listening.  
  
Everything's obvious  
The way you put your hand on me  
The way you talk so easily  
The way your lips are glistening  
Well, I'm listening.  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I won't be back at all  
  
Maybe misery is  
What I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I'm pleased to meet you  
  
Right now I think I'm sane,  
But I'm really just anxious  
To cross that bridge  
The subconscious oasis  
Where right is right  
And wrong is wrong  
And you weren't there  
To build me up  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I won't be back at all  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you (pleased to meet you)  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery (many times before)  
Is what I need to keep my sanity (many times before)  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way (many times before)  
I'll be pleased to meet you (many times before)  
  
And maybe yesterday (many times before)  
Was a day that I could get away (many times before)  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity (many times before)  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before
