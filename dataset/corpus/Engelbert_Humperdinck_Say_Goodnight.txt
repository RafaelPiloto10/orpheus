When I say goodnight in your little room  
Ah, that's the time I love you best of all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The shadow of your smile is on the wall  
But I can see the reason, it's just your way of teasin'  
But my, oh, my, my, my, I'll take it all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The only place where we can be alone  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
To hold you close this way, you say is wrong  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
If you don't stop, our love just can't go on  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
Why can't we let the night just linger on
