You make me nervous when you're flying around  
The secret service couldn't track you down  
You tell me no then you kiss me  
You say hello then you ditch me  
You try to run when you see me  
  
I never knew what this dream was about  
You say let's go then you're lost in the crowd  
I don't know where you're going  
You won't show then you're showing  
I don't know then I'm knowing  
  
You're always busy when I call on the phone  
(Stop stop)  
I'm broken hearted are you made out of stone  
(Stop stop)  
Snakes alive why you grievin'  
It's six to five and I'm leavin'  
I can't stand no more teasin'

I say it's my way or highway
