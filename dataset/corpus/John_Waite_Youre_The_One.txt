You could be anywhere  
But if you think of me  
Know that you're on my mind  
Got my soul in you hands  
  
No matter what you do  
I know it must be right  
I'm a man of the world  
And I've seen everything  
  
And this time I see one I like  
You're the one  
That's keeping me wide awake at night  
You are  
  
You're the one  
And you could be my lucky break  
You just might  
If you need me at all  
  
Pick up your telephone  
I'll be there overnight  
Like a puzzle complete  
We become as one  
  
How could this not be right  
I'm a man of the world  
And I've seen everything  
And this time I see one I like  
  
Yeah  
You're the one  
That's keeping me wide awake at night  
You are  
  
You're the one  
And you could be my lucky break  
You just might  
And I want the whole world to know  
  
You're the one  
You are  
You're the one  
You are  
  
I'm a man of the world  
And I've seen everything  
And this time I see one I like  
You're the one  
  
That's keeping me wide awake at night  
You are  
You're the one  
And you could be my lucky break  
  
You just might  
You're the one  
That's keeping me wide awake at night  
You are  
  
You're the one  
And you could be my lucky break  
You just might  
Yeah  
  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one
