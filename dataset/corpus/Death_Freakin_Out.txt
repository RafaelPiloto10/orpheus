It's a scheme  
There's a fiend  
Why is my head spinning round in my dreams?  
It's a time and a place  
Why are all these lights popping up in my face?  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
There's a sign on the wall  
There's a witch with a big crystal ball  
There's an eye  
There's a heart that's pumpin faster as we run through the park  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Everyone looks very strange today  
All of their faces seem to be washed away  
  
Everyones talking I can't hear a thing  
I'm on the moon why is the sky so green?  
  
I think I'm walking up the stairs  
While I'm sitting right down in my chair  
I feel so light but I'm not  
Everything's turning cold but it's hot.  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
(Or are you freakin out?)  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out
