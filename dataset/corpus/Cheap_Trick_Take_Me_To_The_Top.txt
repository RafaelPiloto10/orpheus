We go back a long long way  
And it seems like yesterday  
When the words are spoken  
Or whispered in your ear  
Things have changed since we first met  
You alone are more than I expect  
But the good outweighs the bad  
  
By 110 per cent  
You take me to the top  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling  
  
Oh all the way  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling oh  
Some things go in circles  
Something's in the air  
  
You know just what I'm feeling  
You can make the difference  
You know I really care  
You take me to the top  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling oh all the way  
  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling  
Oh ah ah oh  
If I could dream a dream  
With a happy end  
You'd be in it every night  
  
Again and again  
Right here by my side  
You'd never go away  
But I'm awake  
I sing I say  
You take me to the top  
  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling  
Oh all the way  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling oh
