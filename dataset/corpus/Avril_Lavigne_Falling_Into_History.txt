Don't matter what people say  
I never did believe them  
I know, I know they know everything  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love  
  
Now our days seem strange  
I guess my heart was bound to change  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I never thought that I'd say  
That I don't really miss you  
I lived, I breathed your breath through me  
  
Time has a way of passing by  
Until I don't remember why  
Or how to hurt for you  
  
Love's pain has gone somewhere  
And I'm finally hanging it there  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
Falling into,  
Falling into,  
You're falling into history  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love
