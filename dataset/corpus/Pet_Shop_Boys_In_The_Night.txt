Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
There's a lot of people coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
  
That Zazou, he don't care  
Dark glasses, long hair  
Takes his time, sneers at men  
Some ugly people want revenge  
  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night (In the night)  
  
In the night (In the night)  
  
That Zazou, he sleeps all day  
Then down to Select or Le Collisee  
Sips his drinks, orders more  
Says what he thinks and it's a crazy war  
  
Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
A knock on the door in the night  
(In the night In the night ...)  
  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night (the night the night)  
  
And when the soldiers strut, all he cares about  
Is love  
When the flags are out, all he cares about  
Is love  
Well, there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and -  
Collaboration (-ration)  
  
In the night  
(In the night In the night In the night In the night ...)  
  
(Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime  
Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime  
Crime Crime Crime Crime ...)  
  
In the night (In the night In the night)  
  
In the night (In the night In the night)  
  
Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
There's a lot of people coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
  
Now everybody's under somebody's spell  
Unless they've already gone to hell  
In the streets you can hear the people say  
That, Zazou, he should be locked away!  
  
When the soldiers strut, all he cares about  
Is love  
Oh, when the flags are out, all he cares about  
Is love  
And there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and collaboration
