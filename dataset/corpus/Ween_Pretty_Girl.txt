There's a sweater wearin', coat totin', boot footin'  
Good lookin' man on town  
There's a smooth-talkin', funny walkin' dude around  
There's a pretty girl and she sees him walkin'  
Looking him up and down  
She thinks she'd like to roll and rock him  
Turn his life around  
  
There's a scum-suckin' lip pucking  
Fat ol' truck drivin' man on town  
There's a boot lickin' high tickin' dude around  
There's a pretty girl and he sees her walkin'  
Looking her up and down  
He'd like for her to roll and rock him  
Turn his life around
