Yesterday, as I talked with a friend in town,  
I forgot to remember that you'd gone.  
For a moment, I found myself smiling,  
But a moment isn't very long.  
  
An' last night as I danced with a stranger,  
An' she held her cheek close to my own,  
For a moment, I almost forgot you,  
But a moment isn't very long.  
  
Every now an' then I get a chance to smile,  
But those every now an' thens just last a little while.  
An' tonight I've got a date with a new love,  
But I know I'd do just as well at home.  
For a moment, maybe I could forget you.  
But a moment isn't very long.
