What do you want from me?  
Now you got me  
Now my fingers bleed  
Now they're staring at me  
I'm a coward now  
I hold my peace  
  
Now you tie me up to your feather bed  
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn  
You won't let go  
You won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What do you want from me?  
Now you got me  
Now my energy you suck from me  
And I'm holding on for dear life  
  
Quit smothering me  
Quit laughing at me  
I've got a disease  
An English disease  
It won't let go  
It won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What did you put in that syringe?  
Whatever you really said to him?  
Is sitting there, inside of me  
  
And you bother me  
You possess me  
You're there again  
Ahead of me  
And I won't let go  
I won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head
