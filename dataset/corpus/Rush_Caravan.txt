In a world lit only by fire  
Long train of flares under piercing stars  
I stand watching the steamliners roll by  
  
The caravan thunders onward  
To the distant dream of the city  
The caravan carries me onward  
On my way at last  
On my way at last  
  
I can't stop thinking big  
I can't stop thinking big  
  
On a road lit only by fire  
Going where I want, instead of where I should  
I peer out at the passing shadows  
Carried through the night into the city  
Where a young man has a chance of making good  
A chance to break from the past  
The caravan thunders onward  
Stars winking through the canvas hood  
On my way at last
