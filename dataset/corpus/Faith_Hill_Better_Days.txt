Hard times are fallin' on you  
Even when you smile I see the hurt come through  
And I know it feels like it's never gonna end  
You say nothin's been right for a long time  
And every step you take is an uphill climb  
I see you're reachin' out  
So let me tell you friend that  
  
Better days are comin' around  
I know you feel like  
The whole world's gone and let you down but  
Better days they're comin' for you  
I know they will  
'Cause I'll be right here makin' sure they do  
  
And if your sky ain't lookin' the fairest  
There ain't no reason to be embarrassed  
Ain't nobody in the world ain't felt  
The rain from time to time  
And just when you think it's all over and done  
The night get easier one by one  
So take my hand and hold on tight  
And soon you're gonna find that  
  
Better days are comin' around  
I know you feel like  
The whole world's gone and let you down but  
Better days they're comin' for you  
I know they will  
'Cause I'll be right here makin' sure they do  
  
I know what it's like  
To have to face the fight  
But I won't let you stand alone, no  
  
Better days are comin' for you  
I know it feels like  
The whole world's gone and let you down but  
Better days they're comin' for you  
I know they will  
'Cause I'll be right here makin' sure they do  
  
Oh, better days  
I know, I know, I know  
The whole world's gone and let you down  
Better days are comin' for you  
I know they will
