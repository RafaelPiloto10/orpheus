  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
I got a mother, sister and a brother  
Who have been this, this way before  
But I'm determined to go and see them  
Over on that other shore  
  
Sing it  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
Play it  
Play that one more time  
  
I'm going down to thet river of Jordan  
Just to bathe my wearisome soul  
And if I could touch the hem of His garment  
Then I know he'll take me home  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
Yeah  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
  
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
