Dreaming nothing to do  
Dreaming nothing to say  
Can I say there's nothing to dream about  
But something keep us moving away?  
  
I said, "Land ho, will I be sailing forever?  
Oh, oh, I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho, will I be giving forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
Wind is all far I can see  
When I'm feeling to strife  
For there's something that's calling me  
Oh, something that's so hard to find  
  
I said, "Land ho, will I be sailing forever?  
Oh, oh, I guess, I'll feel my ship is getting old  
Land ho, will I be dreaming forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
I said, "When you're alone there's not a sail in sight  
There's a great sky and you may just try to take a life  
Oh well, there once was a lady made me feel alright  
But she couldn't stay, she just sailed away  
Now this only waves to see me through the night"  
  
Maybe I'll always be sad  
And maybe there'll always be strife  
Drifting alone with a saddened tone  
Afloat in the ocean of life  
  
I said, "Land ho, you're sailing ship on forever?  
Oh, oh, I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho, will I be searching forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
Will I be sailing forever?  
Will I be dreaming forever?  
Will I be searching forever?  
Forever, forever, forever  
Forever, forever, forever
