Verse: Away away from the noise  
Alone with you  
Away away to hear your voice  
And meet with you  
Nothing else matters my one desire is  
  
Chorus: To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
  
Oh oh(Repeat for A while)  
  
Verse 2: Away away, away away from the noise alone with you  
Away away to hear your voice and meet with you  
It's been a while but heart my heart cry again  
  
Chorus: To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
To worship you I live  
To worship you I live I live to worship you  
  
Oh oh(Repeat for A while)
