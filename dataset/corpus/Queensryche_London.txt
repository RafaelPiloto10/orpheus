It was November 4th  
I last held your hand  
It seemed our time would last forever  
You said don't ever leave  
I thought you'd never go  
I wish I could just remember your name...  
  
You're just a memory now  
Like all the ones before  
But with your pain I've had to suffer  
Your eyes alight with flame  
As the picture burns  
I hear the screams from long ago  
  
They cry remember, blood-red streaks on  
velvet throats at night  
The streetlights fanned our trail of fame  
through  
  
London London  
The memories will never leave me  
London London  
All I see is you  
London London  
The cries in the night  
Keep bringing me to  
London London  
Calling out to me  
  
Oh there's some things in life I could never face  
The worst is being alone  
Sometimes I wish I could have taken your  
place my love  
You know I don't want to live forever  
  
Oh let me see you standing in the  
shadows once again  
We'll walk the streets like long ago in  
  
London London  
The fire in your eyes will be bringing me to  
London London  
All I need is you  
The cries in the night keep ringing on in  
London London  
Calling out to you
