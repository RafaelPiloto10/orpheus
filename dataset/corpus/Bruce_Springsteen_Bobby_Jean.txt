Well I came by your house the other day, your mother said you went away  
She said there was nothing that I could have done  
There was nothing nobody could say  
Me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen  
I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes  
We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things wed ever  
Seen  
Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid  
Now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did  
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere  
In some bus or train traveling along  
In some motel room therell be a radio playing  
And you'll hear me sing this song  
Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between  
And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind  
But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, bobby jean
