He's got a great big hit he's in a limousine  
When I see his face somethin' starts to freeze  
He's got money for miles his girl comes out of vogue  
When he acts like an ass he's treated like a rogue  
  
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' it's boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
This isn 't for the first time in my life  
  
She comes from top cheekbones she never worried hard  
You could camp an army on her family's yard  
When I look at blue blood I want to make it mud  
And tear that difference down rock an' roll is how  
  
I feel it comin' it's breakin' my neck  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin breakin' my neck  
I feel lr comin' jealousy baby  
This isn 't for the first time in my life  
  
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' breakin' my neck  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' heatin' my eyes  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
Jealousy baby
