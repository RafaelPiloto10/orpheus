Here we are, two very bewildered people  
Here we are, two babes that are lost in the wood  
We're not quite certain what has happened to us  
This lovely thing that's so marvelous  
But right from here, the future looks awfully good.  
  
Our love affair was meant to be  
It's me for you dear, and you for me  
We'll fuss and quarrel  
And tears start to brew  
But after the tears, our love will smile through  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when you're by my side  
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare  
"Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when you're by my side  
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare  
"Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"
