When I passed you in the doorway  
You took me with a glance  
I should have took that last bus home  
But I asked you for a dance  
  
Now we go steady to the pictures  
I always get chocolate stains on my pants  
My father he's going crazy  
Say's I'm living in a trance  
  
But I'm dancing in the moonlight  
It's caught me in its spotlight  
It's alright, alright  
Dancing in the moonlight  
On the long hot summer night  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning  
And I'm on the streets again  
I disobeyed another warning  
I should have been in by ten  
  
Now I won't get out until Sunday  
I'll have to say I stayed with friends  
But it's a habit worth forming  
If it means to justify the end
