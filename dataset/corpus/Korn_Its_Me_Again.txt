I shred your bullshit poetry  
Yes it's me again  
I wreck your positivity  
Yes it's me again  
  
I fuck it to watch it bleed  
I kick it to make it scream  
I am the alternate choice to some straight life of mercy  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again  
  
I rip your throat out on a whim  
Yes it's me again  
I only ask for everything  
Yes it's me again  
I squeeze it to feel it breathe  
I smash it to fuel this need  
I am the antidote for  
Whatever sickness you feed  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again  
  
Little ms. fucker don't move an inch  
Y'all dumb suckers can't take the heat  
Your blood rushing from head to feet  
This is what I stand for  
  
All your choices that's done to man  
All you fuckers know who I am  
I'm the living proof that you can  
Turn around and say "it's me again"  
It's me again  
  
Fuck  
Fuck  
Fuck  
Fuck  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again
