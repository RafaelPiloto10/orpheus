Goddamn your righteous hand  
I eat innocent meat  
The housewife I will beat  
The prolife I will kill  
What you won't do I will  
I bash myself to sleep  
What you sow I will reap  
I scar myself you see  
I wish I wasn't me  
I am the little stick  
You stir me into shit  
I hate the fool I am  
Goddamn your righteous hand  
Goddamn, goddamn (oh, lord)  
Goddamn, goddamn  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
I throw a little fit  
I slit my teenage wrist  
The most that I can learn  
Is in records that you burn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
I am the vhs  
Record me with your fist  
You want me to save the world  
I'm just a little girl  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn... Get
