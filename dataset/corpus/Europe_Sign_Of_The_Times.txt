When the word is out from the other side  
She turns around  
Cause day and night she's waited patiently  
Now a different kind of world out there  
Is to be found  
It's over not for everyone to see  
This is the way it's meant to be  
  
It's the way that we make things right  
It's the way that we hold on tight  
I know, it's the sigh of the times  
It's the way that we make things turn  
It's the way that we live and learn  
I know, it's the sigh of the times  
  
It wakes him up, he turns around  
And now he's gone  
He's been waitin' for this moment desperately  
Now the time is right, he's turnin' back  
He's going home  
Yeah it's over now for everyone to see  
This is the way it's meant to be  
  
It's the way that we make things right...  
  
And every time it's on my mind  
I feel so insecure  
It worries me to end up here alone  
But every time I realize I need her more and more  
I'd never make it on my own  
  
It's the way that we make things right...
