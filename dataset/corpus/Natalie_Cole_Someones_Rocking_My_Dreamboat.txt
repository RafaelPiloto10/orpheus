Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
Someone's invading my dream.  
We were sailing along,  
So peaceful and calm,  
Suddenly something went wrong.  
  
Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
Disturbing the beautiful dream.  
It's a mystery to me,  
This mutiny at sea,  
Who can it be?  
  
A friendly breeze gave us a start  
To a paradise of our own.  
All at once a storm blew us apart  
And left me drifting alone.  
  
Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
I'm captain without any crew.  
But with love as my guide,  
I'll follow the tide,  
I'll keep sailing 'til I find you.
