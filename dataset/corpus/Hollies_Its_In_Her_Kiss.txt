Does she love me?  
I want to know.  
How can I tell if she loves me so?  
Is it in her eyes? (No, no, you'll be deceived)  
Is it in her sighs? (No, no she'll make believe)  
If you want to know  
If she loves you so  
It's in her kiss (that's where it is)  
Is it in her face? (No, no, that's just her charms)  
In her warm embrace? (No, no that's just her arms)  
If you want to know if she loves you so,  
It's in her kiss (That's where it is).  
Oh yeah, it's in her kiss (That's where it is)  
So hold her and squeeze tight.  
Tell her what you want to know.  
If it's love,  
If it really is.  
It's there in her kiss  
How 'bout the way she acts? (No, no, that's just her way)  
You're not listening to the words that I say.  
If you want to know,  
If she loves you so  
It's in her kiss (That's where it is)  
Oh yeah, it's in her kiss (That's where it is).
