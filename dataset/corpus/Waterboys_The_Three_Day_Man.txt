I'm the three day man  
It's three days too long  
Everything is in its right place but  
Something is wrong  
Time is on wheels  
And my legs shake  
I have to live with every decision  
That you make  
  
And that doesn't mean  
That I'll be your slave  
It doesn't mean you're here to stay  
It doesn't mean we're friends for life  
You know I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
  
Sixes and sevens  
Oh how it rains  
Sleep is a station  
Life is a train  
People snatch instinctively for  
Whatever crutch they need  
But I promise not to abuse you  
If you don't love me leave  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means that you're not here to stay  
Means that we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means you're not here to stay  
Means we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you!
