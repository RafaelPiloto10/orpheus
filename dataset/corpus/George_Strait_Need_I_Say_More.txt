You're the only one and only  
My heart's beating for  
I love you, need I say more  
Now and ever, we'll be together  
Of that you can be sure  
I love you, need I say more  
  
I don't know just what it is  
That you're needing to hear me say  
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe  
All this discussion could never  
Do justice to something so heavenly-made  
I'd rather tell you  
With touches how I feel inside  
  
Let me hold you, let me show you  
What true love's all about  
In these arms of mine I know you will find  
You won't do without anymore  
I'll love you forever need I say more
