Let's turn the lights down soft and low  
And watch the fire embers glow  
Let's lock the world outside the door  
This is the night we've been waiting for  
  
The moon is shining through the window pane  
I hear the echo of a passing train  
Taking someone's lover far away  
But in your arms is where I wanna stay  
  
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that I've found you  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
Let your hair fall across your breast  
Show me the warmth of your soft caress  
The music's playin' soft and slow  
We're driftin' into the afterglow  
  
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that I've found you  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
I'm never gonna let you go
