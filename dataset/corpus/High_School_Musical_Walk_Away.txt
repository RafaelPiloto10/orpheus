I guess I should've known better  
To believe I'm a lucky chain, oh  
I lent my heart out forever  
And finally learned each other's names  
  
I tell myself, this time it's different  
No goodbyes, cause eyes can't bear to see it  
I'll never survive on one that's coming  
If I stay, ooh no!  
  
Just walk away! Oh, and don't look back  
Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad  
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that  
Before It's too late, oh, just walk away!  
  
(Walk, walk, walk away)  
Ooh, just walk away!  
(Walk, walk, walk away)  
Aye aye, aye yeah  
  
I really wish I could blame you  
But I know that it's no one's fault  
No, no, no, no  
A Cinderella with no shoe  
And a Prince that doesn't know he's lost  
  
He says that her face is so familiar  
Each goodbye with just the same old song  
But this time I will not surrender!  
'Cause I'm gone, ooh, yeah!  
  
Just walk away! Ooh, and don't look back  
Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad  
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that  
Before It's too late, oh, just walk away!  
  
(Walk, walk, walk away)  
Oh, just walk away!  
(Walk, walk, walk away)  
Oh, just walk away!  
  
I've got to let it go, ooh  
Start protecting my heart and soul  
Cause I don't think I'll survive a goodbye again  
Not again!  
  
Just walk away! Oh, and don't look back  
Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad  
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that  
Before it's too late, before It's too late!  
Oh, just walk away!  
  
(Walk, walk, walk away)  
Walk away, walk away, yeah!  
(Walk, walk, walk away!)  
Walk away, walk away, all right  
(Walk away, walk, walk away)  
Walk away, walk away  
(Walk, walk, walk away!)  
Walk away, walk away, oh, ooh
