You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
You will keep the fires burning  
  
We're standing in the desert  
Of dry bones  
But still we see Your life  
Walking through the valley of shadows  
But holding onto light  
And we're waiting  
Waiting on You God  
And our hearts will trust  
Trust in who You are  
  
God, who keeps our fires burning  
Burning through the darkest night  
See the hope in our hearts  
The faith in our eyes  
You can move the highest mountain  
You can keep our dreams alive  
You're the joy of our hearts  
And You're the fire in our eyes
