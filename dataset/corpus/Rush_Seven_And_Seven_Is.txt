When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man  
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a jam  
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone  
You can throw me if you want to 'cause I'm a bone and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!  
  
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes  
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized  
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way  
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!  
One...Two...Three...Four!
