A heritage of vision  
Was given to us all  
To smell the rose's fragrance  
To hear the songbird's call  
To watch the distant moonlight fill  
The coming of the tides  
To understand that life is more  
Than always choosing sides  
  
And some have seen what can be seen  
Of sailing ships and kings  
And some are given feet of clay  
And some are given wings  
And some must struggle just to breathe  
Some have a golden spoon  
And some will never leave the nest  
While some walk on the moon  
  
And don't you know the life that lives  
Within the silent hills  
Is just as rich and beautiful  
And just as unfulfilled  
As man with all his intellect  
His reason and his choice  
Oh, who's to say the nightingale  
Has any less a voice  
  
The silver dolphins twist and dance  
And sing to one another  
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds  
For all that lives are brothers  
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear  
The elephant, the whale  
All children of the universe  
All weavers of the tale  
  
So palomino lie back down  
And dream yourself to sleep  
The hawk flies with the morning dove  
The lion with the sheep  
As far away as you may go  
We'll never be apart  
It's in your dreams that you will know  
The seasons of the heart
