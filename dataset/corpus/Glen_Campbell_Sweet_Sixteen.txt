When first I saw the love light in your eyes  
I thought the world held not the joy for me  
And even though we've drifted far apart  
I never dreamed but what I dreamed of thee  
I love you as I've never loved before  
Since first I saw you on the village green  
Come to me in my dreams of love adored  
I love you as I loved you when you were sweet  
When you were sweet sixteen  
I love you as I've never loved before  
Since first I saw you on the village green  
Come to me in my dreams of love adored  
I love you as I loved you when you were sweet  
When you were sweet sixteen
