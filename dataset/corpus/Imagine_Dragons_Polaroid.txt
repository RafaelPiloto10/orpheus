[Verse 1]  
I'm a reckless mistake  
I'm a cold night's intake  
I'm a one night too long  
I'm a come on too strong  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a hold my cards close  
I'm a wreck what I love most  
I'm a first class letdown  
I'm a "shut up, sit down"  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am a headcase  
I am the color of boom  
That's never arriving, and  
You are the pay raise  
Always a touch out of view  
And I am the color of boom  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm a midnight talker  
I'm an alley walker  
I'm a day late two-face  
I'm a burn out quick pace  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm gonna get ready  
For the rain to pour heavy  
Let it fall, fall  
Let it fall upon my head  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
Love is a Polaroid
