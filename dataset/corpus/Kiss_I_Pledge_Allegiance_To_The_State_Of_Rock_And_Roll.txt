Looking back yeah I feel alright  
Getting more than my expectations  
Yeah my future looks clear and bright  
I'm living up to my reputation  
  
Yeah, I'm satisfied  
Yeah, until the day I die  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legend's growing as the story's told  
I pledge allegiance to the state, of rock and roll  
Oh yeah!  
  
I've been a rebel for all my life  
I never cared about regulations  
I only went for the things I liked  
And my guitar was my inspiration  
  
Yeah, we pay a price  
Yeah, I made the sacrifice  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legend's growing as the story's told  
I know that heaven's gonna wait  
I pledge allegiance to the state, of rock and roll  
  
[solo]  
  
Yeah, I'm satisfied  
Yeah, until the day I die  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legend's growing as the story's told  
I know that heaven's gonna wait  
  
I gave my blood and I gave my soul  
I stood my ground and I took control  
The legend's growing as the story's told  
I pledge allegiance to the state, I pledge allegiance to the state  
Of rock and roll, of rock and roll  
  
Rock and roll.
