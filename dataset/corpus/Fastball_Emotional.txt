She was looking right through me like I was made out of glass  
A la la la la la  
Heaven, lie and tell, comes back like up at a check  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get  
  
Smokin' and drinkin', tryin' to kick stuff Monday night  
Smokin' and drinkin', tryin' to kick start Monday night  
I try and I try  
A sneaky feeling is coming over me  
  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
  
She said "boy, you take, you take me somehow, I don't know who you are
anymore.  
I don't know who you are anymore"  
(break)  
Too many complications, conversations that go nowhere  
Get out of my my my my head, head, I see you everywhere  
  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
  
She said "boy, you take, you take me somehow, I don't know who you are
anymore.  
I don't know who you are anymore, I don't know who you are anymore,  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
