Passion take the wind  
And break me from this tie  
We're mortals on the earth  
Oh but God's in the sky  
I haven't got a clue  
I haven't got a thing  
But what I give to you  
Is all that I could bring  
I'll give you all my time  
That's everything to me  
You know my only crime  
Is this flight of fantasy  
  
Because I've nothing else here for you  
And just because it's easier than the truth  
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do  
I'll fly for you  
  
Passion take the wind

And just because it's easier than the truth  
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do  
I'll fly for you  
  
I'm just an average boy  
You're more than an average girland  
When you sing to me the 'sho be doos'  
You sing so well  
Oh don't you know that when I'm under you  
I'm overjoyed
