(duet with kenny G)  
Sittin' here, just starin' at your picture  
Waiting for your call  
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion  
We could have it all  
Time and time again, You tell me to be patient  
But we can't let love slip away  
  
Chorus:  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness  
Fall asleep alone  
Give me a sign, a man's not suppose to face life  
Standing on his own  
When you're near me, I can't help but see forever  
Come and rescue me tonight  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't you see I need ya, gotta have ya  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love this time  
No No I need you right now, I need you right now  
Oh darlin', a love like this, a love like this  
Is so very hard to find, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love
