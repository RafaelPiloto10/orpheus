After twelve  
Not so well  
Won't pretend  
It's too soon to tell  
What's 'round  
This bend  
No disgrace  
About face  
Any thing  
Not to have to chase  
You down again  
  
You know  
Nothing hurts  
Like losing  
When ya know  
It's really gone  
Except for the pain  
Of choosing  
To hold too long  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be  
The end of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
A lot to say  
But not today  
Let the radio  
Break the silence  
As we drive  
A kiss goodbye  
Not this time  
Don't remember  
What about this song  
I ever liked  
  
Ya know  
Nothing hurts  
Like losing  
When ya know  
I'm already gone  
Except for the pain  
Of choosing  
To hold too long  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be the end  
Of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere  
But we're still nowhere at all  
I watched your tail  
Lights fading  
I try but the tears won't fall  
I remember  
What it feels like  
To know love  
And have it taken away  
I can't think of what  
I've learned right now  
But I'll be thanking  
You someday  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be  
The end of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
Roooooooooool  
Credits start to roll  
(Oooh)  
  
I guess the driveway  
End of the road  
(End of the road)  
  
Woo (woo)  
Woo (woo)
