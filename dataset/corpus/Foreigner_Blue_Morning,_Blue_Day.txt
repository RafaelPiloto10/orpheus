Out in the street at six AM, another sleepless night  
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head from what went down last night  
Know we both have our own little ways, but somehow we keep it together  
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say, I guess it don't even matter  
  
[Chorus]  
Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way  
Blue morning, can't you see, what your love has done to me  
  
I've always listened to your point of view, my ways I've tried to mend  
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end  
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye  
You say you might send a letter  
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone  
I need someone to make me feel better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
(Blue morning) blue morning, (blue morning) blue morning  
(Blue morning) blue morning, blue blue blue day, yeah
