This park and these houses, old streets I have walked  
Everything dear, will it be here  
One day when I am returning?  
My friends will get married, have children and homes  
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
My friends and my family, this dull little town  
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed  
Everything old and familiar  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it...  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong
