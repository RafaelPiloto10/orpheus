Altamont, now, won't be the same  
When we see each other again  
If it all falls apart, who is to blame?  
  
Don't you think it's time to get real?  
I want to scream out the way I feel  
I'm so tired of watching you bail  
  
Hey, don't try to tell me it's okay  
Don't turn me off and walk away  
You've gotta say it's straight  
  
Close the door,  
But it won't go away  
Tell me that it's at your control  
I'm not waiting for you anymore  
  
Hey, don't try to tell me it's okay  
Don't turn me off and walk away  
You've gotta say it's straight  
  
Altamont, I'm on your side  
Believe it or not I'm on your side  
It's so hard to be your friend sometimes  
  
Hey, don't try to tell me it's okay  
Don't turn me off and walk away  
You've gotta say it's straight  
  
You'd better say it's straight
