They say you never come home, boy you been drivin' too fast  
When you gonna shape up, how long is this gonna last  
You may be laughin' today, but listen to some good advice  
An' take a look at tomorrow in a workin' man's weary eyes  
You gotta pick a carreer, go for the gold  
Smile for the camera, do what you're told  
Well you can take away the ladder cause I ain't gonna climb it  
If there's a stairway to heaven I swear I'm gonna find it  
  
Well there are winners and outlaws and leaders and lovers  
Behind every man in the news  
And one thing I know is behind everyone there's a boy who had nothin' to lose  
Behind every man who has somethin' to say  
There's a boy who had nothin' to prove  
An' every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
Every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
  
She says you never call, how come you're actin' so tough  
You either hold me too tight, or you don't hold me enough  
Don't be afraid of me angel, I ain't about to clip your wings  
Just put your feet on the ground and your arms around the real thing  
  
You gotta love me for keeps, feather the nest  
Plan for the future, an' gimme your best  
Boy we're never gonna have a normal family life  
Steamin' up and down the speedway on the back a' your bike  
  
Well there are winners and outlaws and leaders and lovers  
Behind every man in the news  
And one thing I know is behind everyone there's a boy who had nothin' to lose  
Behind every man who has somethin' to say  
There's a boy who had nothin' to prove  
An' every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
Every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
  
Bad attitude, you got us tearin' our hair  
Such a bad attitude, boy you just don't seem to care  
We try to lay down the rules, but you were born to refuse  
What's the world gonna do with a boy like you  
You got it bad, you got a bad attitude  
  
You try to lay down the rules, well I was born to refuse  
What's the world gonna do with a man like you  
You got a bad - no, you got a bad, you got a bad - ooh, you got a bad  
You got a bad - no, you got a bad, you got a bad attitude  
  
Every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
Every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy  
  
Well there are winners and outlaws and leaders and lovers  
Behind every man in the news  
And one thing I know is behind everyone there's a boy who had nothin' to lose  
Behind every man who has somethin' to say  
There's a boy who had nothin' to prove  
An' every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
Every hero was once, every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
  
Oh, you got a bad, ooh, you got a bad, oh, you got a bad attitude  
No, you got a bad, you got a bad, you got a bad attitude
