If I could reach the stars, I'd pull one down for you  
Shine it on my heart, so you could see the truth  
That this love I have inside, is everything it seems  
But for now I find, it's only in my dreams  
  
[Chorus:]  
That I can change the world  
I would be the sunlight in your universe  
You will think my love was really something good  
Baby, if I could, change the world  
  
If I could be king, even for a day  
I'd take you as my queen, I'd have it no other way  
And our love will rule, in this kingdom we have made  
Till then I'd be a fool, wishin' for the day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, if I could change the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, if I could change the world
