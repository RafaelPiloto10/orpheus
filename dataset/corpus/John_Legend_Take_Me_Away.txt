Yeah, yeah  
  
We danced and sing, somewhere in between heaven and hell  
Gabrielle, that was her name  
Everyone was smiling, even through their tears, under her spell  
But in Gabrielle's eyes, nothing  
I asked, "Do you not like the music?"  
She said, "It's alright"  
But she dances to her own side  
So she says,  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me away from here  
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing  
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby  
  
Long as I'm there with you  
  
I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream  
Nightmares live where you live  
Tears were in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall  
I get the world to know a her smile is  
I asked, "Do you dance with me now?"  
Let me try to figure out  
The fastest round out of town  
And she says,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh oh yeah yeah yeah  
I got a full tank of gas  
Anywhere you wanna go, girl  
All you have to do is ask girl  
Oh, she said,  
  
[Chorus: x2]
