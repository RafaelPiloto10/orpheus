They called you a failure  
They called you a lost cause  
They said you would never become anything at all  
A generation  
With no direction  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize yet to be claimed  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you and I know you'll find the truth  
I know you've been broken  
'cause I've seen the abuse  
I know there's a place inside your heart begging for truth  
For a softspoken answer  
That won't break your spirit  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize that's yet to be claimed  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you and I know you'll find the truth  
but that's not what they told you when they said that they gave up on you and
you're nothing and you'll never be anything  
I'll wait for the day when you'll stand up and say I can do all things through
him who strengthens me  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you. yes I believe in you and I know
you'll find the truth.
