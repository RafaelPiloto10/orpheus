How old was I, 5 or 6 or so  
The innocent years, long ago  
Father on a chair reaching up so far  
Crowning the tree, with that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty diamonds in the sun  
Nothin' but good things will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder at that old tin star.  
I grew up and I found a place to live  
As I unpacked my things I found a gift  
And it felt like home, though I'd come so far  
For there in my hands was that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty, diamonds in the sun  
Nothing but good things, will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up, stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder, at that old tin star.  
I have kids of my own and troubles I've had some  
I've cried my tears and I've had my fun  
I climb that chair and I reach out so far  
And my son looks up at that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty, diamonds in the sun  
Nothing but good things will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up, stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder, at that old tin star.
