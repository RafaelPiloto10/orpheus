Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine  
Her hair feels like silk on my arm  
Her lips tell me so tenderly she's mine alone  
Until we part tonight and she goes home.  
  
Barrowed angels, belong to someone else  
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself  
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me  
But she loves me and I know she'll save  
Some borrowed time for me.  
  
I wish that I could have her more than just tonight  
We can't go on like this, it isn't right  
When that lonesome feelin' comes a-knockin' on my door  
I'll call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more.  
  
Barrowed angels, belong to someone else  
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself  
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me  
But she loves me and I know she'll save  
Some borrowed time for me
