I'm afraid to fly  
And I don't know why  
I'm jealous of the people who  
Are not afraid to die  
It's just that I recall  
Back when I was small  
Someone promised that they'd catch me  
And then they let me fall  
And now I'm fallin'  
Fallin' fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
You'd think by now I'd learn  
Play with fire you get burned  
But fire can be oh so warm  
And that's why I return  
Turn and walk away  
That's what I should do  
My head says go and find the door  
My heart says I've found you  
And now I'm fallin'  
Fallin' fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
Help me I'm fallin'  
Fallin' fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
(It always turns out the same  
When I fall)  
Lovin' someone, losin' myself  
Only got me to blame  
Help me I'm fallin'  
Fallin'  
Catch me if you can  
Maybe this time I'll have it all  
Maybe I'll make it after all  
Maybe this time I won't fall  
When I fall in love
