You say you're finished with love  
That you'll never love again as long as you live  
But believe me, you'll love me again  
If for once you find it in your heart to forgive  
Take my Heart  
I can undo all the wrong, let's start  
Just a little bit of love goes far  
You'll begin to live again  
Take my heart, come on back where you belong  
Let's start, you can do it, if you take my heart  
You'll begin to live again  
  
Now that you've seen the bad side  
There's a chance that you won't find the heart to forgive  
But believe me, there's always the good side  
In a world just made for us where lovers can live  
  
Take my heart, I can undo all the wrong, let's start  
Just a little bit of love, goes far, you'll begin to live again  
  
Take my heart, come on back where you belong, let's start  
You can do it if you take my heart, you'll begin to live again
