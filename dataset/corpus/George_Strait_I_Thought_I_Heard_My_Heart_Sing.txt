Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
I went home flying high  
I met the girl of my dreams tonight  
A wild fire, screamin' inside  
I know it's real 'cause my heart don't lie  
  
Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, here I am knocking on your door  
This old hound wants to talk a little more  
The T.V.A. and the hoover dam  
Don't turn me on like holding your hand  
  
I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing
