Well, I'm a crazy mixed up kid  
And I love to dance like this  
Well, I love to rock 'n' roll  
Because it satisfy my soul  
  
Well, I love to jump and shout  
Hey, it really knock me out  
You give me music with a beat  
It'll knock me off my feet  
  
I don't care what you heard  
This is a crazy mixed up world  
  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world  
I'm in a crazy mixed up world  
  
When I loosen up down inside  
My feet begin to glide  
My heart goes pump, pump, pump  
The music makes me jump, jump, jump  
  
I can't control myself no more  
Music got me on the floor  
Well, I'm crazy ain't you heard  
I'm in a crazy mixed up world  
  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world
