Momma, don't you cry anymore  
I'm not the same girl I was before  
You know I'll always be your baby  
But I've found some brand new arms  
And they're gonna rock me  
  
Momma, can't you see my love is turning?  
I've got to live these things that I'm learning  
You don't have to try and save me  
I'm wrapped up in a dream, but he's  
Gonna rock me  
  
All night long he lays where heaven lies  
He takes me on a way to paradise  
And he rocks me in the cradle of love  
  
Momma don't you remember how it feels?  
Oh, don't you remember?  
My heart and my soul is rolling like a wheel  
Well, I know you think I'm crazy  
Yeah, I'm crazy for the one who wants rock me  
  
Yeah, I know you think I'm crazy  
And I'm crazy for the boy who's gonna rock me  
  
He's gonna rock me  
He's gonna rock me  
Well my baby's gonna rock me  
He's gonna rock me
