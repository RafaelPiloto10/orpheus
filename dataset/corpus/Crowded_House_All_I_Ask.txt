All I ask  
Is to live each moment  
Free from the last  
Take the road forgotten  
Don't leave me here  
Oh, please let me stray  
Far from familiar things  
  
All I ask  
Is to live each moment  
All I ask  
Is to live each moment  
Free from the last  
  
Strange roads  
Going nowhere  
Going nowhere (in particular)  
  
All I ask  
Is to live each moment  
All I ask  
Is to live, live each moment  
Free from the last  
Free from the last  
All I ask
