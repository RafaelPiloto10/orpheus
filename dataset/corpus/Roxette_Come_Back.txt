Never looked back on a love affair. i never spent minutes on history, it made
me sad, it made me so sad. and in no time no time at all a change has begun
and the name is you, i feel strange, you  
Ade my life strange. cos baby when you get close to me i say there's a certain
chemistry.  
  
Come back before you leave. i haven't got room for a broken heart. come back
before you leave. you shouldn't go at all, you shouldn't go at all.  
  
So many years and so many nights, i still can recall oh the way that you move
when you dance, do you want to dance? we've had our habits and attitudes, you
make me remember the power when everyt  
S right, please stay the night. cos baby when you get close to me there's
something about you i really need.  
  
Come back before you leave...  
  
Babe, come back before you leave, i'll be the air for you when you breathe,
i'll be the rising sun. close the door, let's make love, all god's angels sing
above into the rising sun.
