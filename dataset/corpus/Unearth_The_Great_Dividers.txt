It's true there were better ones  
That led their people  
To lead their country  
Who cared for this world  
But who are we to change  
Without the strength of all  
The nations will crumble  
  
Feed lies for war  
Bring the nations to it's knees  
Risking worldly structure and integrity  
The balance of our kind controlled by hatred,  
Distorted truth and lies  
United is the only way to stand  
Leaders of the free world lead into the land of the un-free  
God sent politics hammered down with a fist too bold  
Play the council of pawns in the quest of total control  
  
Free us of this hate  
Free us from this hate  
  
Take over the world  
Does hate mean freedom  
Divide our home  
Does hate mean freedom  
Take over the world  
Divide our home  
Does hate mean freedom
