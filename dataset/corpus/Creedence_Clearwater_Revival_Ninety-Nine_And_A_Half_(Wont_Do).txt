I got to have all your love, night and day.  
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.  
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.  
  
Don' t be led in the wrong direction.  
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection,  
Yes he do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right.  
Lookie here,  
  
We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right.  
  
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight,  
Yes we do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right, sugar.  
Got to have a hundred,  
Got to have a hundred.  
All right.  
Ooh, I must do, I must do,  
I must do now.  
  
Oh! got to have a hundred!  
Got to have a hundred!  
Oh! got to have a hundred, too right.  
Got to have a hundred, now. oh!
