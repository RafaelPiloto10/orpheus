Met a girl that I loved  
In a town way down in Texas  
'Neath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl  
I ever did see  
So I held her in my arms  
And told her of her many charms  
And I kissed her  
While the fiddles played  
The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'  
And all the world was bright  
As I held her on that night  
And I heard her say  
Don't you ever go away  
So I held her in my arms  
And told her of her many charms  
And I kissed her  
While the guitars played  
The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'  
  
All the world was bright  
As I held her on that night  
And I heard her say  
Don't you ever go away  
So I held her in my arms  
And told her of her many charms  
And I kissed her  
While the guitars played  
The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'
