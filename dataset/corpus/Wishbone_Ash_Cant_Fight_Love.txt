I don't care about no curfew tonight -  
I just come of age, my car is stood outside.  
Got my wings and I'm looking for a place to roost -  
Cruise with the boys, catch anything on the loose.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I'm going to accelerate in some old fatty bar, yes sir,  
If I hit the deck, just pick me up for some more.  
Going to look around 'till the first girl smiles at me,  
And on the way home I'll check out her i.d.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
I'm going to write my graffiti on the wall -  
Paint this town like it's never been done before.  
The way I feel, there's nothing I can't do,  
So hold on, baby, I'm coming straight on through.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
Running wild with the pack, ace up my sleeve,  
Got a taste of your love, and it's blinding me.  
Can't see straight, that's for sure.  
Me, I'm knocking on your pearly door.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
Don't want to fight your love,  
Can't fight love.  
Don't want to fight your love,  
Can't fight love.  
Got to give it to me now.  
Can't fight love.  
I can't fight your love.
