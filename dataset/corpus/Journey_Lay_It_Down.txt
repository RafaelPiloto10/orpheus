Lookin' 'round for a feelin'  
I love the rhythm and blues  
The place was rockin' and reelin'  
I thought I'd shake me loose  
The band was pumpin' Motown  
Lord how they could play  
The girls a-started singing  
Rock the night away  
  
[Chorus:]  
By the midnight hour  
They could've raised the dead  
They were takin' it higher  
Higher, higher, higher, ringin' in my head  
Lay it down, lay it down  
Lay it down, lay it down  
  
Whiskey, wine and women  
They get me though the night  
I ain't lookin' for trouble  
I ain't lookin' to fight  
A little vertical persuasion  
Would do me right  
What I'm really needin'  
Ah, double shot tonight.  
  
By the midnight hour  
We were on our way  
She was takin' it higher  
Higher, higher, higher, then I heard say  
  
[Chorus]
