Schnine  
He's a pretty good guy  
He's nice to his neighbors  
You can count on him to buy your school candy bars  
He's a real nice guy  
He's always got the jumper cables  
He'll take your mail in when you're on vacation  
He's a good-hearted man  
Volunteers at the library  
He'll help you find a book on whales  
He's a thoughtful man  
Remembers your birthday  
Says God bless you when you sneeze  
  
But there's a problem  
It's not your average problem  
But it's a pretty big problem  
His hobby is moyda  
His hobby is moyda  
He'll eat a hamboyga  
Then commit moyda  
  
He's a friendly guy  
He waves to all the joggers  
Children use his backyard as a short-cut  
He's a real sweet guy  
He always recycles  
Referees the Junior High basketball for no pay  
He's a great, great man  
He'll sign your petition  
Then proceed to compliment your new haircut  
  
But there's a problem  
It's not your average problem  
But it's a pretty big problem  
His hobby is moyda  
His hobby is moyda  
South of the boyda  
He's wanted for moyda  
  
Here he comes  
Hey Larry, how ya doing?  
How's the garden coming?  
You know, it's interesting  
I just read at the library  
That you need to rotate the soil  
To get real plump, read tomatoes  
Oh, and one more thing  
My hobby is moyda  
Two, three, four  
I'm a sick man  
My hobby is moyda  
My hobby is moyda  
I'll eat a hamboyga  
Then commit moyda  
  
I never loiter  
After committing the doity deed of moyda  
Only Sigmund Freuda  
Knows why I cannot and will not stop committing moyda  
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
