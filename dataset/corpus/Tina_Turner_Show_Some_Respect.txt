I made a resolution and I plan to keep my work  
But I need you to make it work  
You've got to read the message, understand what's on my mind  
Cause not to see would be a crime  
And we could lose it anytime  
  
We've got to show some respect  
We've got to learn to protect  
Don't take it for granted, I know  
That if you want to stay close  
We've got to show some respect  
  
But I believe in working, then I believe in a little help  
Cause I'm not a light unto myself  
Without a thing of value, why settle for second best  
We don't know what's up ahead  
And we can't let ourselves forget  
  
We've got to show some respect  
We've got to learn to protect  
Don't take it for granted, I know  
That if you want to stay close  
We've got to show some respect  
  
For the things that I love about you  
From the woman that you see inside  
Don't let it walk out the door  
Love follows every time
