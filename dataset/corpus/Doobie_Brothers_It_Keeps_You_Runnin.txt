Say, where you gonna go  
Girl, where you gonna hide  
You go on leavin' out your heart  
And all it's sayin' down deep inside  
  
From here I can feel your heartbeat  
Oh, you got me all wrong  
You ain't got no worry  
You just been lonely too long  
  
I know what it means to hide your heart  
From a long time ago  
Oh, darlin'  
  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
  
Oh, I know how you feel  
Hey, you know I been there  
But what you're keepin' to yourself  
Oh, you know it just ain't fair  
  
Are you gonna worry  
For the rest of your life?  
Why you in such a hurry  
To be lonely one more night?  
  
Well, I know what it means to hide your heart  
From a long time ago  
Oh, darlin'  
  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'  
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'
