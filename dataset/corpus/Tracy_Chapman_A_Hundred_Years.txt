Baby sweet baby  
Won't you please  
Come on back home to me  
I've been so lonely  
These few days feel like  
A hundred years  
  
How you make me worry baby  
How you make me worry about you  
Here I am I'm knowing  
That I can't live without you  
Here I am thinking  
Someday we make this a long time thing  
Here I am I'm knowing  
That I would do most anything  
If you keep on loving me baby  
  
Baby sweet baby I've been waiting  
Seem like waiting is all I do  
Don't say you won't come back to me  
And make me have to go out chasing after you  
We get in a fight  
You stay out late  
You have no idea  
How much you make me worry baby  
Called everyone in town  
I think you know  
So come on now  
Come on come on  
Back home  
  
Baby sweet baby  
I'm a fool in love  
But I still got my pride too  
I'll wait a little longer  
I'll suffer for my heart  
Then I'll go find someone to worry about me  
As much as I worry about you
