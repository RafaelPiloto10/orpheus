Oh Lord my God when I in all some wonder  
Considered all the worlds Thy hands have made  
I see the stars I hear the roaring thunder Thy art throughout the universe
displayed  
Then sings my soul Thy save dear God to Thee  
How great Thou art how great Thou art  
Then sings my soul  
  
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation  
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart  
Then I shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim my God how great Thou
art  
Then sings my soul
