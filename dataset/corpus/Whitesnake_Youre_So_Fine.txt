I want you so bad,  
The thought is driving me mad  
Like a cat on the prowl,  
You come when you want  
And not when I call  
  
So sly, so pretty,  
I want to steal all the keys to your city  
Tight skirt, skinny leg,  
You make a bad dog sit up and beg  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine all mine,  
'Til the end of time,  
Baby, you're so fine  
  
You're so hot with body heat,  
You cause a fire walking down the street  
You got class, you got style,  
The girls don't like it,  
But, the boys go wild  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine  
  
Dance little sister,  
Spinning on a dime,  
Shake a shimmy little twister  
  
I'm gonna make you,  
I'm gonna make you mine,  
Mine all mine,  
You're so fine  
  
I want you so bad,  
Just the thought is driving me mad,  
I want to know what you'll do,  
Baby, baby, I can't wait  
To get my hands on you  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine all mine  
You're so fine, you're so fine  
You're so fine, you're so fine  
You're so fine
