Hey, hey, hey  
  
Your lipstick stains  
On the front lobe of my  
Left-side brains  
I knew I wouldn't forget you  
And so I went and let you  
Blow my mind  
  
Your sweet moonbeam  
The smell of you in every  
Single dream I dream  
I knew when we collided  
You're the one I have decided  
Who's one of my kind  
  
Hey soul sister  
Ain't that mister mister  
On the radio, stereo  
The way you move ain't fair, you know  
Hey soul sister  
I don't wanna miss  
A single thing you do  
Tonight  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Just in time  
I'm so glad you have  
A one track mind like me  
You gave my life direction  
A game show love connection  
We can't deny  
  
I'm so obsessed  
My heart is bound to beat  
Right out my untrimmed chest  
I believe in you  
Like a virgin, you're Madonna  
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind  
  
Hey soul sister  
Ain't that mister mister  
On the radio, stereo  
The way you move ain't fair, you know  
Hey soul sister  
I don't wanna miss  
A single thing you do  
Tonight  
  
The way you can cut a rug  
Watching you is the only drug I need  
So gangster, I'm so thug  
You're the only one I'm dreaming of  
  
You see, I can be myself now finally  
In fact there's nothing I can't be  
I want the world to see you'll be with me  
  
Hey soul sister  
Ain't that mister mister  
On the radio, stereo  
The way you move ain't fair, you know  
Hey soul sister  
I don't wanna miss  
A single thing you do  
Tonight  
  
Hey soul sister  
I don't wanna miss  
A single thing you do  
Tonight  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight
