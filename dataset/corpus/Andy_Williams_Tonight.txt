If I could hold you in the arms of love tonight  
I'd never let you go  
As the hours go by I'd show you why we've waited for this  
As two lovers whisper low  
  
If I could feel that magic kiss your lips invite  
Imagine the joys I'd know  
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway  
And share the promise of a new tomorrow  
In the arms of love tonight  
  
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway  
And share the promise of a new tomorrow  
In the arms of love tonight  
  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
