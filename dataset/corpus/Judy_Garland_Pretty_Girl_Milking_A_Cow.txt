Twas on a bright morning in Summer  
When I first heard his voice spakin' low  
As he said to a colleen beside him  
"Who's that pretty girl milking her cow?"  
  
Och many times often ye met me  
And told me that I should be  
You darling, Acushla,  
A Lana Mavourneen, Asuilish machree  
  
Purty girl, purty girl,  
With no on there to show her how  
The purt, purt, purty girl is now  
Milking her cow  
  
I have not the manners or graces  
Of the girls in the world where ye move  
And I have not their beautiful faces  
But oh, I've a heart that can love  
  
And if it please ye, I'll dress me in satin  
With jewels, jewels in me brow  
But och, don't be after forgettin'  
Your purty girl milking her cow  
  
Purty girl, purty cow,  
I'm sure this song would have never been wrote  
If the pretty girl hadda been milking her goat  
But the goat wasn't feeling well anyhow  
So the pretty girl was milking her cow.  
  
Her cow, her cow  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la la, la, la, la La, la, la, la  
A purty girl milking her cow!
