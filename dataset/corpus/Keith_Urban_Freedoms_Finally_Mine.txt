Freedom's Finally Mine  
I'm on a red dirt road winding up to a sky of blue  
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two  
No more sittin' at home leave the T.V. and the telephone far behind  
This life is killin' us all, back roads are lookin' mighty fine  
Oh, and  
  
[Chorus]  
Freedom's finally mine  
I ain't takin' anymore  
Yeah freedom's finally mine, It's finally mine  
I ain't takin' anymore  
Oh, freedom's finally mine  
  
I'd like to throw out this cellular  
And kick off these shop-shined shoes  
Leave the kids at your mama's  
And take off to Timbuktu  
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks  
Leadin' off to way out back o' yonder  
There's no mountain I can't climb  
To satisfy this need of mine to wander  
Oh, 'cause...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no desert I can't cross  
No river too wide  
I can do what I want now  
'Cause freedom's finally mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh freedom oh freedom It's finally mine, yeah it's mine  
It's finally mine, yeah it's mine
