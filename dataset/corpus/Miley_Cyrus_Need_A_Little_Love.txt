When the darkness leaves you lonely,  
Or the world tries to push you away  
When your sky is looking troubled  
You can count on me  
'Cause I'm gonna stay (I'm gonna stay)  
  
Put your worries in my pocket  
I've got a key so we can lock it  
I swear that, I won't let them escape  
  
Love, it's always worth it love  
Everyone deserves it  
It's the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love, it wants to heal you, love  
It sees the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love  
  
If there's something you're in need of (you're in need of)  
You only have to let me know  
I got a shoulder you can lean on  
And I'm always (always) right up the road  
  
Put your fears in my pocket  
I've got a key so we can lock it  
And no I(no I), won't let them escape  
  
Love, it's always worthing love  
Everyone deserves it  
It's the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love, it wants to heal you, love  
It see the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love  
  
Every night when your heart is praying for peace  
A noise in your head, yeah  
There's a light that is yours to keep  
And brighter than all the rest  
  
Love, it's always worthing love  
Everyone deserves it  
It's the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love, it wants to heal you, love  
It see the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love
