Don't you have a word to show what may be done  
Have you never heard a way to find the sun  
Tell me all that you may know  
Show me what you have to show  
Won't you come and say  
If you know the way to blue?  
  
Have you seen the land living by the breeze  
Can you understand a light among the trees  
Tell me all that you may know  
Show me what you have to show  
Tell us all today  
If you know the way to blue?  
  
Look through time and find your rhyme  
Tell us what you find  
We will wait at your gate  
Hoping like the blind.  
  
Can you now recall all that you have known?  
Will you never fall  
When the light has flown?  
Tell me all that you may know  
Show me what you have to show  
Won't you come and say  
If you know the way to blue?
