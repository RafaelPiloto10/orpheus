My man don't love me  
He treats me so mean  
My man don't love me  
He treats me so mean  
Well he's the, lowest man  
That I've ever seen  
  
He wears high trimmed pan  
Stripes are really yellow  
Well he wears high trimmed pan  
Stripes are really yellow  
But when he starts to love me  
He's so fine and mellow  
  
Love will make you gamble  
And stay out all night long  
Love will make you gamble  
And stay out all night long  
Love will make you do things  
You always thought was wrong  
  
But if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
Said if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
But you're so darned mean  
I just know you're gonna drive me away  
  
But if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
Said if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
But you're so darned mean  
I just know you're gonna drive me away  
  
Love is like a faucet  
It turns off and on  
Love is like a faucet  
It turns off and on  
Sometimes when you think it's on baby  
It's turned off and gone
