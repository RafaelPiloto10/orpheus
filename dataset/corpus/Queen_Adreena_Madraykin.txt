(K. J. Garside)  
Let not your hold be so tight,  
She'll return in the morning,  
If you give her the night.  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Is she suffering?  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Revealing her birthmark you cast out her eye,  
Clipped are the wings of the angels sighs,  
Revealing her birthmark you put out her tongue,  
Clipped are the wings of the fairies who run.  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Is she suffering?  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
How deep does she weep in your well of unkeep,  
The kiss of Madraykin will keep you from sleep.  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep.
