I've been in love so many times.  
I thought I knew the score,  
But now youve treated me so wrong.  
I can't take any more.  
  
And it looks like  
I'm never gonna fall in love again.  
  
All those things I heard about you,  
I thought they were only lies,  
But when I caught you in his arms,  
I just broke down and cried.  
  
And it looks like  
I'm never gonna fall in love again.  
Fall in love.  
I'm never gonna fall in love,  
Fall in love again.  
  
I gave my heart so easily.  
I cast aside my pride,  
But when you fell for someone else, baby,  
I broke up all inside.  
  
And it looks like  
I'm never gonna fall in love again.  
  
That's why I'm singing,  
Fall in love,  
I'm never gonna fall in love.  
Please don't make me  
Fall in love again!
