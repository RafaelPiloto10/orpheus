Moving moving  
Move away , move away  
Spirit changed the conversation  
Stepping stones across the land  
  
I never wanted to be a hero  
I never wanted to be a man  
I hurt you darling  
I made you cry  
I hurt you darling  
Don't ask me why  
  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
If I could say this was judgment day  
You know I'd be a millionaire  
  
Justice is fine  
I need you so  
I can't let go  
I hurt you darling  
I made you cry  
I hurt you darling  
Don't ask me why  
  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
If I could say this was judgment day  
You know I'd be a millionaire  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
  
Move move move move away  
Move move move move away  
Why don't you move away
