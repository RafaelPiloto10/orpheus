Civilization crumblin' fast  
End the world with a blast  
People afraid walking the streets  
Scums have their day  
'Til they run into me  
Are you ready?  
Livin' in fear ain't livin' to me  
I'm armed with a gun defending the free  
They blew it in nam shot up my friends  
I'm back in the streets the fight never ends  
I was born with a gun in my hand  
I'll die for my country  
But I'll die like a man  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Now we're back to animal law  
The payback's a bitch and I'm paying all  
All my life I been waitin'to see  
Who's gonna win crumbs or me  
Are you ready  
My brother's still in da-nang  
Puttin'an ad in the back of kerrang  
I'm looking for people who just want to kill  
We'll go back the nam cause no one else will  
Land of the free  
Home of the brave  
Now that's how it is  
And that's how it stays  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed
