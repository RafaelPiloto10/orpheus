Now that the party's over  
Now that the noise is through  
Now that the room is empty  
There's only me and you  
  
I think that I might just fall in love with you, with you  
There were so many people trying to talk to you  
Telling you how they need you  
Trying to get to you  
I think that I might just fall in love with you with you  
  
Party to my head (???)  
Party (???)  
  
Didn't seem to matter early on  
But now that the people have gone  
I think that I might just fall in love with you, with you  
  
Now that you know how I feel  
Everything's up to you  
Now that the party's over  
Tell me hat I should do  
I think that I might just fall in love with you, with you...
