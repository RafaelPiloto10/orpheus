He went to Paris looking for answers to questions  
That bothered him so  
He was impressive, young and aggressive  
Saving the world on his own  
Warm summer breezes, French wine and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
The summers and winters scattered like splinters  
And four or five years slipped away  
  
He went to England, played the piano, and married  
An actress named Kim  
They had a good life, she was a good wife  
And bore him a young son named Jim  
All of the answers and all of the questions  
He locked in his attic one day  
Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'  
And twenty more years slipped away  
  
War took his baby,  
Bombs killed his lady and left him  
With only one eye  
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered  
All he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling he was recalling  
Answers that he never found  
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound  
  
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinks  
His Green label each day  
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing  
But he don't care what most people say  
After eighty-six years of perpetual motion  
If he likes you he'll smile and say  
"Jimmy, some of it's magic, probably tragic,  
But I had a good life all the way"  
He went to Paris looking for answers to questions  
That bothered him so
