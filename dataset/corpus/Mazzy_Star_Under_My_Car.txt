Saw you layin' under my car, but you took it too far  
Don't you know  
Held your hand, well I knew you slipped away  
Watched your eyes, turn to grey, in mine  
But you're still lingering  
I see it somehow  
You know what I mean, don't you  
Don't you  
Say what you mean  
I've said it so well  
Me and my own  
I still, but you're damned  
My eyes are crying, as you slip from my view  
I guess you know it, I feel for you  
Yes I do  
Saw you layin under my car, but you took it too far  
Don't you know  
Held your hand, as you, slipped away  
Watched your eyes turn to grey tonight  
Me, I'm alone  
I'm just driving away, from the side of you laying in death  
Goodbye before I cry  
I know you feel for me too  
And I do  
But it's the end  
Goodbye my friend
