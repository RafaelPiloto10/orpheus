Walk me out in the morning dew my friend  
Walk me out in the morning dew today  
Can't walk you out in the morning dew my friend  
Can't walk you out in the morning dew today  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning  
I thought I heard a baby cry today  
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning  
You didn't hear no baby cry today  
  
Where have all the people gone this morning  
Where have all the people gone today  
You'll never find no people here this morning  
You didn't need those people anyway  
  
I thought I heard a young male call this morning  
I thought I heard a young male call today  
You didn't hear no young girl call this morning  
You didn't hear no young girl call today  
  
And now I can't walk you out in the morning dew my friend  
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
