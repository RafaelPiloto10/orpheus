Woke up this morning, went to the window, saw a rainy day.  
Feeling the pressure from all the things I gotta face today.  
All of my days, are totally crazy can't do nothing right.  
It's an ordinary day.  
Every minute feels like an hour slowly creeping by.  
All of this stress but I do my best to keep it all in stride.  
I need to decide.  
I need to unwind.  
All these things are on my mind  
It's an ordinary day.  
[chorus]  
Things are crazy but it's all right.  
You make me feel alright again.  
When it rains you are the sunshine.  
That lights me up from deep with in.  
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure.  
You given me the pleasure of an ordinary day  
Pounding the pavement.  
Another engagement.  
Gotta make it there on time.  
Hitting the side walk  
Hearing the small talk of people passing by.  
Wondering why.  
Gotta rewind.  
Think I gotta clear my mind.  
It's an ordinary day.  
What are the chances I've locked glances with a passer by.  
Oh, a stranger must be an angel cause he smiled.  
I wonder if he knows anything I know that there is life  
In an ordinary day.  
[Chorus]
