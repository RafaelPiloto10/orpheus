If I should stay, I'll only be in your way  
So I'll go, but I know I'll  
Think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
You, my darling you, hmmm,  
  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all I'm taking with me  
So, goodbye  
Please, don't cry  
We both know I'm not what you, you need  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish to you, joy and happiness  
But above all this, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I, I will always love you  
  
You, darling, I love you  
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you
