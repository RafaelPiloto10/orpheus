I want a little girl, call my own.  
She must be someone who's all alone now.  
Say, I want a little girl  
To fall in love with me, oh yeah.  
  
I want a little girl, but she may not look  
Just like a picture in a story book.  
If she can cook chicken, yeah,  
She'll suit me to a T.  
  
And she don't have to wave her hair  
Or even wear fancy clothes,  
I wouldn't even care.  
She don't wear nylon hose, oh no.  
  
I want a little girl  
To love a lot.  
You know that I'd give  
Her everything I got.  
I want a little girl  
To fall in love with me.
