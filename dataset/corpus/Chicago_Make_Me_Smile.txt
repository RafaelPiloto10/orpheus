Children play in the park, they don't know  
I'm alone in the dark, even though  
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside  
  
I'm so happy  
That you love me  
Life is lovely  
When you're near me  
Tell me you will stay  
Make me smile  
  
Living life is just a game so they say  
All the games we used to play fade away  
We may now enjoy the dreams we shared so long ago  
  
Oh my darling, got to have you. Feel the magic when I hold you  
Cry sweet tears of joy, touch the sky  
  
Now I need you more than ever. No more crying - we're together  
Tell me you will stay. Make me smile
