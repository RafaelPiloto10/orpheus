Sky is blue I'm watching you  
Grass is green what does it mean  
Clouds are white don't loose that fight  
Generations oversight  
Is fucking up my poetry  
Let it ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
The sky is blue I'm watching you  
The grass is green what does it mean  
Clouds are white don't loose that fight  
Generations oversight  
Is fucking up my overdrive  
Let it ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
Let it ride, ride, ride
