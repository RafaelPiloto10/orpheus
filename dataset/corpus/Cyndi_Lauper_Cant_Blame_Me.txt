Baby I want the  
Love you been savin'  
Tell me the truth  
Boy why you been waitin'  
Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me  
  
We could be sweethearts  
We could be never  
Did you forget  
I love you forever  
Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me  
  
I can see by now  
You don't want to know  
Can't blame me if I love you so  
  
I'll be your dancer  
A silky eyed lady  
Dreamin' of moonlight  
Hopin' that maybe  
Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me  
  
We could be sweethearts...
