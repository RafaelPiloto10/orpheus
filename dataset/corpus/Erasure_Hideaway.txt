One day the boy decided  
To let them know the way he felt inside  
He could not stand to hide it  
His mother she broke down and cried  
  
Oh my father  
Why don't you talk to me now  
Oh my mother  
Do you still cry yourself to sleep  
  
Are you still proud of your little boy  
Don't be afraid (Be afraid)  
You don't have to hide away  
  
The boy he was rejected  
By the people that he cared for  
It's not what they expected  
But he could not keep it secret anymore  
  
Far from home now  
Waiting by the telephone  
There's a new world  
You can make it on your own  
  
Are you still proud of your little boy  
Don't be afraid (Be afraid)  
You don't have to hide away  
No  
  
(Don't be afraid)  
(Love will mend your broken wing)  
(Time will slip away)  
(Learn to be brave)  
  
Oh my father  
Why don't you talk to me now  
Oh my mother  
Do you still cry yourself to sleep  
  
Are you still proud of your little boy  
Don't be afraid (be afraid)  
You don't have to hide away  
  
(Don't be afraid)  
(Love will mend your broken wing)  
(Time will slip away)  
(Learn to be brave)
