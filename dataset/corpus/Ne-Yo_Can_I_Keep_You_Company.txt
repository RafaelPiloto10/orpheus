Mmmmmmm  
Sugar coco brown  
She stands five foot three  
She's all by herself  
It doesn't make no sense to me (she's incredible)  
I'm watching real close (close)  
But I take it slow (slow)  
Make sure she's not with anybody (anybody)  
Very insecure, so that now I am sure (sure)  
I slide right in and next to the Shorty  
  
And say now correct me if I'm wrong, aren't you alone tonight (alone tonight)  
You got it going on  
Girl your everything I like (everything I like)  
And I'm not trying to bother you  
But girl if you don't mind (girl if you don't mind)  
Can I keep you company (Keep you company)  
Baby can I keep you company (Keep you company)  
  
Smiling at me now  
Such a pretty smile (such a pretty smile)  
I'm figuring her out  
And I really dig her style (really dig her style)  
We have a couple drinks (oh)  
Have a couple laughs (oh)  
Suddenly the nights about to end  
We have one more toast (oh)  
Than she pulls me close and in my ear she starts whispering  
  
Correct me if I'm wrong, aren't you alone tonight (alone tonight)  
You got it going on  
Your everything I like (everything I like)  
And I'm not trying to bother you  
But if you don't mind (if you don't mind)  
Can I keep you company (Keep you company)  
Baby can I keep you company (Keep you company)  
  
She said correct me if I'm wrong, aren't you alone tonight (alone tonight)  
You got it going on  
Your everything I like (everything I like)  
And I'm not trying to bother you  
If you don't mind (if you don't mind)  
Can I keep you company (Keep you company)  
Baby can I keep you company (Keep you company)
