You come around every now and then  
Your clothes are different but you're still the same  
Why else would you come here?  
Scumbag on a mission  
You're telling me that it's been awhile  
Shit eating grin and a brand new lie  
Somebody let you come here  
Scumbag with permission  
  
Never thought I'd see  
The likes of you around this place  
What's the special occasion?  
Did you run out of friends?  
  
Here you are, comin' 'round again  
And things are different but you still pretend  
You've got a reason to come here  
Scumbag with ambition  
And now you're telling me that things have changed  
And you'll be leavin' in a couple of days  
You're gonna change the world someday  
Scumbag with a vision  
  
It must be nice to know  
You've got it all figured out  
But from where I'm sittin'  
It's the same thing again and again  
  
You never stop to think  
Before you open up your mouth  
Cause every time you do  
It's the same thing again and again
