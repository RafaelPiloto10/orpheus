Life is too short, don't throw it away  
Hear what I say, if you're lonely  
Stand up, if you fall down  
Please look around, you're not the only  
  
Life is too short, don't lose your time  
The sun will shine, for your tomorrows  
You'll win, if you don't lose  
Try it again, forget your sorrows  
  
There is a chance, make the best, out of your life  
But it's so tough, only the strong, they will survive  
There are always some good reasons to live for  
Between the shadow, there's a light, you can't ignore  
Don't cry a little, little, cry a little, little tonight  
  
Life is too short, don't throw it away  
Hear what I say, if you're lonely  
Stand up, if you fall down  
Please look around, you're not the only, baby, baby  
  
Life is just too short, you can't run away  
Baby let me be your soul survivor  
Life is just to short, baby everyday  
Baby I will lift you, high and higher  
  
No where to go you're always in my heart I swear  
Baby I know, if you need me, I'll be there  
I will never ever leave you alone, oh no  
And we have so many reasons to go, oh no  
Don't cry a little, little, cry a little, little tonight
