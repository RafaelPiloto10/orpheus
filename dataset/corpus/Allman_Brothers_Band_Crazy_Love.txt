Somewhere down on a back street  
Way down deep in the back seat  
Is where I first learned how to moan your name  
I remember on the night I met you  
Ooh, sweet baby, I just can't forget you  
And I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love  
  
Crazy love, crazy love  
I love you baby  
But your too bad to tame  
Crazy love, crazy love  
You got it all  
  
Laid up here lookin' at my shoes  
Stretched out with these hotel blues  
I wish you'd only just call me on the phone  
There ain't no doubt and I don't mean maybe  
Ooh, I just can't forget about you baby  
And I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love  
  
Crazy love, crazy love  
I love you baby  
But your too bad to tame  
Crazy love, crazy love  
You got it all
