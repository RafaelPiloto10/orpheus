Excuses for our money  
Is that religion  
One more dollar for  
What Jesus has given  
Hell is free  
But you might have to pay for heaven  
One more dollar  
Is that religion  
Why? Why do you give all your  
Money away  
What makes you think  
That you have to pay  
Because if god is there  
There's no admission  
No need to give  
To be forgiven  
Live your life with decision  
Live your life not religion
