Forever my darling our love will be true always and forever I'll love only you  
Just promise me darling your love in return  
Make this fire in my soul dear forever burn  
My heart's at your command dear to keep love and to hold  
Making you happy's my desire dear loving you is my goal  
I'll forever love you the rest of my days I'll never part from you and your
loving ways  
[ guitar ]  
My heart's at your command...  
This is my last letter end of the song my life is so miserable I can't go on
