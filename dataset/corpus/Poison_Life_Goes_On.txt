I felt this before  
Now I feel it again  
No matter how hard I try  
This feeling won't end  
  
So I pretend you're here by my side  
Tonight on this lonely ride  
I keep telling myself that  
  
[Chorus]  
Life goes on while you're miles away  
And I need you  
Time goes on as night steals the day  
There's nothing I can do  
  
You heal up my wounds  
I tasted your tears  
You spilled out your heart  
So I let out my fears  
  
But one fear that I kept to myself  
Was how I prayed that you'd love no one else  
Like you're saying you love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you only knew how much I miss you  
  
When my mind plays these tricks on me  
It shows me things I don't want to see  
That's why I tell myself  
I keep telling myself  
Just take another piece of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And this last mile I travel with you
