I just can't get through you despite all the ways I try  
Or any of the things I do maybe I'd better off talking to a wall  
Cause you ain't making any sense at all I'm walking and I'm talking  
And I'm trying and I'm lying but I just ain't getting through to you  
Am I just wasting all my precious time cause I ain't wasting a breath  
On you or any of your kind if you had any brains you would open  
Your mind but I guess you're just afraid of what you gonna  
Find it's a malfunction
