Greasy jungle metropolis noir easy tangles the easiest so far ah  
I drove down your road to hazeldean where I tasted your funeral  
Home's sandwiches and coffee I saw your hands melt into one another  
I saw you grieve and grow care a lot about one another  
  
I stood at your sink and I felt your warm water I washed your dishes and  
I looked out your kitchen window where I saw a  
Soulful gymnast melt in the air and shudder just above the snow  
Making moves that just weren't there ah velvet callow with wet  
  
Hands I turned out the lights and breathing shallow hesitated then went
upstairs  
Where I picked up your housecoat dried my  
Hands and touched your hair and just then you awoke you could never really
barely care  
Ah greasy jungle metropolis noir
