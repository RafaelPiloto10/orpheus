Red comes from my Grandpa, he's an all American Brave.  
White come from my Grandma, she's a red-headed Irish maid.  
The blue come from the man I love, 'cause this boy said I do.  
That leaves me a mixed-up with the red, white and blue.  
I'm red, white and blue, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh  
And proud of it too.  
I'm a blue-eyed Indian squaw, everybody calls me a half-breed.  
That's what you get when you sow a little red and a white seed.  
The white man said he'd marry me, he liked cold turkey too.  
That leaves me a mixed-up with the red, white and blue.  
I'm Red White and Blue, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh  
And proud of it too.  
The great white powers had a plan to take the red man's land.  
Well, I bet you think I'm petulant, but I'd never lie to you.  
There's warrior's blood runs through my veins, an' I wish my skin was true.  
Wish my skin was true.  
I'm Red White and Blue. ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh  
I'm Red White and Blue. ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh  
I'm Red White and Blue. ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh, ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh
