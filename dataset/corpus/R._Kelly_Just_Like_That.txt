Oh baby , If I could Explain the joy I feel  
  
Oh If I could explain the joy I feel  
All this love making is oh so real  
Oh like winter time by the fireplace  
Oh like trapped in walls and its no escape  
Oh like a precious jewel with no price tag  
Oh like waterfalls comin' down on me  
Oh like tidal wave comin' from the sea  
Oh like a favorite scene in a big movie  
  
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Oh)  
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna
know)  
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Oh just like)  
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby  
  
Oh like you and me makin' history baby  
Oh like a 99th anniversary  
Oh like a baby when it speaks its first words  
Oh like an uplifting song the first time heard  
Oh like a shelter when the storm gets ruff  
Oh like a mountain top from the bottom up  
Oh like an expensive suite at the best hotel  
Oh like a work of art when its unveiled  
  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (like that )  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (oh oh oh oh
oh, If you wanna know)  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (just like that
yeah)  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that (Oh)  
  
Oh like a great blue sky's on a summer day  
Oh like sitting close in a small cafe  
Oh like making love to someone you love  
Oh like breaking up then making up  
Oh like a warm embrace when you come around  
Oh like the sweetest words when your feeling down  
Oh like lost inside of a mascaraed  
Oh like a celebration in a big parade  
Oh like a secret told to the one you trust  
Oh like kissing you in a all white tux  
  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna
know)  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like
that, if you wanna know)  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like
that)  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that  
  
Like the moon, yeah when it glows at night,  
And like the sun oh yeah when it shines real bright,  
And just like the ocean when the well comes high,  
Like an eagle when it soars in the sky
