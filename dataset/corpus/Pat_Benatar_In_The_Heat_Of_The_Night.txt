In the heat of the night, when you know it ain't right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel, no one can feel like you  
Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity  
There's so much to tie you down  
You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found  
While down at the edge of town  
At a pool hall where they all hang around  
You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew  
And talk about what they're gonna do  
Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?  
Is it right, or is it wrong?  
Does it matter what's right, in the heat of the night?  
  
Out in the streets tonight, under the neon lights  
You're searchin' for something new  
But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you  
They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky  
But were they just passin' through  
Or did they look down, and see what you found was true  
  
But still in the back of your mind  
You've got somethin' to believe in, but there's so much to find  
As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in  
You thought everything is ending, but it's yet to begin  
And you ain't seen nothing yet!  
But what you see you'll never forget, and you'll say  
  
Why oh why)  
Did it take you so long to want something more?  
Why oh why)  
Did you never get off on this before?  
Why oh why)  
Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for  
Why oh why)  
Standin' in front of you like an open door  
  
And then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?  
Is it right, or is it wrong?  
Does it matter what's right, in the heat of the night?  
  
In the heat of the night, when you know it ain't right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel, 'cause no one can feel like you
