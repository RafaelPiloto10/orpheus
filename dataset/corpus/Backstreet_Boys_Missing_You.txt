[Chorus]  
Oh baby I'm missing you  
We used the love so strong  
Tell me where do we go  
Oh baby I'm missing you  
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet  
  
Been checkin' out the places where we used to go  
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd  
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know  
Nobody wants to say where you hang out  
  
And when I call your phone  
Seems like you're never home  
And you don't return my call  
It tears me apart  
This is breakin' up my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still have your pictures hung around my room  
That's the only thing that is left of you with me  
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon  
And make it just the way it used to be  
  
Oh, this is someone new  
Can never go on without you  
Girl I don't want to think about it  
I can't sleep at night  
No this can't be right  
Come back into my life  
(Come back baby come back)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know there's a chance for you and I  
And I believe there's no way our love could die  
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you  
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
