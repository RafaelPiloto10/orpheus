Staring at the ceiling, the roof has a face  
It's telling me I don't belong with the human race  
He's askin me to join him, in eternal sleep  
I give him my soul, my body he can keep  
Reaching just above me , I see my pillow's there  
But yet I have no head, my head is on the chair  
I'm staing at my body, I look as if I'm weak  
So give me back my soul, my body you can keep  
Sitting on my lawn, tt's just before dawn  
I listen to the screaming, another life is gone  
I'm playing with the children, children of the dead  
My mother say's their evil, my daddy he gives a shit  
Their eyeballs are bloody, their skin is ever pale  
Their askin me to follow, I shall, I shall  
They dress me as a clown, I'm screamin as a loon  
We dance upon the cemetery, underneath the moon  
Here I come there I go, I'm a night walker  
I'm starin at you sleepin through your window like a stalker  
I'm taping on the glass, I lick it with my tongue  
I notice that the house is vacant, I'm starin at no one  
I must of fell asleep, I woke up on the floor  
Underneath the carpet, underneath the boards  
I'm gaged with a dead rat, I lay for many weeks  
The rat comes back to life, and is chewing on my cheeks  
Mental Warp  
My brain is gone, my brain is gone  
say no more my brain is gone (4x)  
Coming is my helper, tangling my brain  
Somethings wery wrong I can't describe this pain  
I'm calling for my mother, I'm crawling up the stairs  
My mothers laughing at me, and she's been dead for years  
I'm falling down the stair case, tumble to the floor  
I land up in the attic, next to the cellar door  
I'm play with the pigons, they tell me many lies  
They tell me I'll have wings if I let them peck my eyes  
I hear a womans voice calling from the dirt  
I plat my little seed, and slowly she will spurt  
And now she is a tree, I hear the heart pound  
I take her in my arems, and we make love to the sound  
The wind is my ebony blowing evil thoughts  
Carrying the demons soring with the hearts  
I put it in my body, the wind will bring the rain  
Only lay it's demon egg, deep inside my brain  
They're calling me a killer, I can't say that I'm not  
My daddy's tried to kill me ever since I was a tot  
By poisoning my bottle, I feed it to my friend  
'cause if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end  
I'm sitting with the darkness, talking to the dark  
It's singing lullabies, and stringing on the harp  
I notice that the floor is warm and rather sick  
It's 'cause I'm sitting in my stomach  
Mental Warp  
My brain is gone, my brain is gone  
say no more my brain is gone (8x)
