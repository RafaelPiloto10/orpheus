You've been livin' with your broken heart  
I've been trying hard to play the part  
But some pretender with an easy smile  
Can tell you it's alright  
  
I ain't got nothin' if you leave me now  
Just a hypocrite with broken vows  
If I could change the way of circumstance  
I'd do it just for you  
  
I'm still in love  
I'm still in love  
(I'm) these days (still in love) I find  
I'm still in love  
  
I've been staring in an empty glass  
In a downtown bar thinking about the past  
I'm spinning 'round you like a moth in flames  
But I still can't help myself  
  
And should you tell me  
That you've changed your mind  
Made some decisions  
Gonna cross that line  
  
I can always be available  
Cause time is on my side  
I'm still in love  
I'm still in love  
  
(I'm) these days (still in love) I find  
I'm still in love with you  
Time will tell the truth for us  
It can only make us strong  
  
It'll be alright  
I'm still in love  
I'm still in love  
(I'm) these days (still in love) I find  
  
I'm still in love with you  
(I'm) in your eyes (still in love) in my mind  
I'm still in love with you  
(I'm) these days (still in love) I find  
  
I'm still in love with you  
(I'm) can't you see me falling (still in love)  
I'm still in love with you  
(I'm) these days (still in love) I find  
  
I'm still in love with you  
(I'm) can't you see me falling (still in love)  
I'm still in love with you
