Would you lay with me  
In a field of stone?  
If my needs were strong  
Would you lay with me?  
  
Should my lips grow dry  
Would you wet them dear?  
In the midnight hour  
Should my lips grow dry  
  
Would you go away  
To another land?  
Walk a thousand miles  
Through the burning sand  
  
Wipe the blood away  
From my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Will you bathe with me  
In the stream of life?  
When the moon is full  
Will you bathe with me?  
  
Will you love me now  
When I'm down and out?  
In my time of trial  
Will you stand by me?  
  
Would you go away  
To another land?  
Walk a thousand miles  
Through the burning sand  
  
Wipe the blood away  
From my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Would you lay with me  
In a field of stone?  
If my needs were strong  
Would you lay with me?
