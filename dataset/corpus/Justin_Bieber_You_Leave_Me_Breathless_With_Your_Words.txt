All night, all smiles, we we're holding hands.  
And now you won't shre the bed with me  
Explain if you can  
  
We may not agree on this, but let's not fight.  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
Taken by surprise, because I felt so secure.  
Because all the things, that you've done,  
Have let me wondering  
  
We may not agree on this, but let's not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breath like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words.  
  
We can say that we've changed, together  
Another day--give me your hand, let me  
Explain, because I've come to terms with  
Who you are.  
  
We may not agree on this but let's not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your grip  
Is too tight--let's not fight, your grip is too.  
Is too--tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words.
