Empty bottle was half empty, tide was low, and I was thirsty  
I saw her sitting at the bar, well you know how some girls are  
Always making eyes, well she wasn't making eyes  
So I sidled up beside her, settled down and shouted, "Hi there"  
My name's Stewart Ransom Miller, I'm a serial lady-killer"  
She said, "I'm already dead," that's exactly what she said  
So we tripped the lights fantastic, we was both made of elastic  
Midnight came and midnight went and I though I was the President  
She said, "Do you have a car?" and I said, "Do I have a car?"  
What's so great about the Barrier Reef?  
What's so fine about art?  
What's so good about a Good Times Van  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man, yeah  
My heart wasn't in it, not for one single minute  
Oh then I went through the motions with her  
Her on top, and me on liquor, didn't do no good, well I didn't think it would  
What's so great about the Barrier Reef?  
What's so fine about art?  
What's so good about a Good Times Van  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?
