As I walk along,  
I wonder what went wrong,  
With our love, a love that was so strong.  
And as I still walk on,  
I think of the things we've done  
Together, while our hearts were young.  
  
I'm walkin' in the rain,  
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,  
Wishin' you were here by me,  
To end this misery  
And I wonder  
I wonder,  
Why,  
Why she ran away,  
Yes, and I wonder,  
where she will stay,  
My little runaway,  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
  
I'm walkin' in the rain,  
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,  
Wishin' you were here by me,  
To end this misery  
And I wonder  
I wonder,  
Why,  
Why she ran away,  
I wonder,  
where she will stay,  
My little runaway,  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
