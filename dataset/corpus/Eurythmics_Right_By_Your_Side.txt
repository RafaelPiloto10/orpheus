Give me two strong arms  
To protect myself  
Give me so much love  
That I forget myself  
I need to swing from limb to limb  
To relieve this mess I'm in  
'Cause when depression starts to win  
I need to be right by your side  
  
No one seems to touch me  
In the way you do  
Nothing seems to hurt me  
When I'm close to you  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side  
  
Every single one of us needs  
Love, love, love  
Everybody needs to give and receive love  
Every single day can drag us  
Down, down, down  
But there's nothing left to fear  
When love gets into town  
  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side
