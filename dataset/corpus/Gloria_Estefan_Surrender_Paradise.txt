Tropical breeze, caressing me  
Sweet fragrant air enticing me  
Starlet skies are offering their love to me  
I surrender to you, paradise  
Heaven and earth are becoming as one  
Shining light on their world  
Open your heart, spread your wings  
Take a chance for the flight of your life  
Warm summer night, twinkling of stars  
Gardenia blooms, oh, whispering love  
Moonlight playing up and down a drifting waterfall  
I surrender to you, paradise  
Crystal blue sea, the white sandy beach  
Sunset commands a rainbow to raise  
All the birds in wonderland are singin' perfect harmony  
I surrender to you, paradise  
Secrets of love, lurking beyond, rapture me now  
I know your passion is mine  
Sun cast waves are frolicking along the foamy shore  
I surrender to you, paradise  
Butterflies are flattering the top of strings  
I surrender to you, paradise  
Moonlight playing up and down a drifting waterfall  
I surrender to you, paradise  
I surrender my love, when you want me, you need me  
I will be here giving my love to you, paradise
