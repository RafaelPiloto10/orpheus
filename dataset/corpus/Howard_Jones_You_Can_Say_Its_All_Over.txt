You took the love I offered  
I tried the life that you lead  
The truth was told and forgiven  
You sold the strength that I need  
  
Now I can see that all you wanted  
Was someone you could hold a mirror to  
This mirror shattered into pieces  
You didn't want to really make things true  
  
And the blame that you offered  
Is something I didn't need  
When the truth beads were counted  
Is it you that I freed  
  
And I can say that it's all over  
And I can say that I don't want it too  
I found that when I'm in your presence  
That I could reach the highest side of you  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
  
One more chance is what I stopped saying  
A colder place to lay my head  
Now it's over and truth is bragging  
An empty heart and a single bed  
  
And I can say it's all over  
Well you can say that you don't want it too  
I found that now I've lost your presence  
Love doesn't always let you see right through  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now
