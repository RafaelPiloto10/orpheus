You've got a cute way of talking  
You got the better of me  
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking  
Like a dog hanging on your lead  
I'm in a spin you know  
Shaking on string you know  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
Quarter to four in the morning  
I ain't feeling tired no no no no no  
Just hold me tight and leave on the light  
Cause I don't want to go home  
You put a spell on me  
I'm right where you want me to be  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I want to dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing  
  
You take me higher  
I'm gonna catch on fire 'cause  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance my life away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
You really slipped me a potion  
I can't get off of the floor  
All this perpetual motion  
You gotta give me some more  
You gotta give me some more  
And if you'll let me stay we'll dance our lives away  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
I feel  
You make me feel like dancing
