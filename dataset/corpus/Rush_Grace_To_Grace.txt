A hundred thousand years  
A hundred thousand miles of track  
A hundred thousand tears  
Hundred thousand souls  
You can't give back  
  
When the dark subsides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Face to face  
Eloquent stories  
Of what could have been  
  
A hundred thousand dreams  
A hundred thousand beams of light  
A hundred thousand schemes  
Gods in the heavens can't get it right  
  
When the dark subsides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
Integrity falls shy  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Place to place  
Elegant story  
Of what could have been  
  
When the truth hides  
Integrity falls shy  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Face to face  
Elegant story Of what could have been  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Grace to grace
