When your money's gone  
Friends have turned you down  
And you wander 'round  
Just like a hound  
(A lonesome houn')  
Then you stop to say  
"Let me go away from this old town  
(This awful town)  
There's a place I know  
Folks won't pass me by  
Dallas, Texas, that's the town  
I cry  
(Oh, hear me cry)  
And I'm going back  
Going back to stay there 'til I die  
(Until I die)  
I've got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
(It's buzzin' 'round)  
I've got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
(It's buzzin' 'round)  
Buzzin' 'round my head  
Like a swarm of little honey bees  
(Of honey bees)  
When I got up north  
Clothes I had to spare  
Sold 'em all to pay my railroad fare  
(My railroad fare)  
Just to come back there  
Ridin' in a Pullman parlor chair  
(A parlor chair)  
Sent a telegram, this is what I said  
"Baby, bring a cold towel for my head  
(My achin' head)  
Got the Dallas blues  
And your lovin' man is almost dead  
(Is almost dead)  
I'm goin' put myself on a Santa Fe and go  
(I'm goin' to go)  
I'm goin' to put myself on a Santa Fe and go  
(I'm goin' to go)  
To that Texas town  
Where you never see the ice and snow  
(The ice and the snow)
