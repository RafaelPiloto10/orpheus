The kombucha mushroom people,  
Sitting around all day,  
Who can believe you,  
Who can believe you,  
Let your mother pray, (sugar)  
Well I'm not there all the time you know  
Some people, some people, some people,  
Call it insane, yeah they call it insane, (sugar)  
I play Russian roulette everyday, a man's sport,  
With a bullet called life, yeah mama called life,(sugar)  
You know that every time I try to go  
Where I really want to be,  
It's already where I am,  
Cause I'm already there.(sugar)  
The kombucha mushroom people,  
Sitting around all day,  
Who can believe you,  
Who can believe you,  
Let your mother pray, (sugar)  
I got a gun the other day from Sako,  
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket,  
Yeah, right in my pocket, (sugar)  
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes,  
And I just fucking kick her, and then, baby, she's O.K.(sugar)  
People are always chasing me down,  
Trying to push my face to the ground,  
Where all they really want to do,  
Is suck out my mother fucking brains, my brains (sugar).  
The kombucha mushroom people,  
Sitting around all day,  
Who can believe you,  
Who can believe you,  
Let your mother pray  
I sit, in my desolate room, no lights, no music,  
Just anger,  
I've killed everyone,  
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
Fuck you, it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
Fuck you, it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
How do I feel,  
What do I say,  
In the end it all goes away,  
In the end it all goes away,  
In the end it all goes away,  
In the end it all goes away,  
In the end it all goes away.
