Blank stare  
Disrepair  
There's a big black hole  
Gonna eat me up someday  
Someday fades away  
Like a memory  
Or a place that you'd rather be  
Some place lost in space  
Itch in my head, that's telling me somewhere  
Somewhere out there anywhere  
I don't care, get me out of here  
If I could feel  
All the pins and the pricks  
If you were real  
I could pick what's apart  
And put it back together  
  
This will come true  
Help me get through  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
All I can do  
driving me through  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
One track  
Get you on your back  
Your skin speaks soft  
But your lips couldn't say it  
  
Right now  
You know somehow  
We could take a chance  
We could make it  
Make it  
Right here  
Make it all disappear  
Everything we've been missing  
Missing  
You make me feel  
There's a part of me  
That I want to get back again  
  
Make this come true  
Help me get through  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
All I can do  
Pushing it through  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
Into you  
All I can do  
Driving on through  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
You're slipping through  
I come in two  
Into you  
  
Deep...  
We could become  
Two into one  
Leave this behind  
Over and done  
Everything new  
  
I'm getting through  
Into you  
Do you?
