Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing children singing all is merry and bright  
So hang your stockings and say your prayers cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
He's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle what a beautiful sight  
Jump in bed and cover up your head cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy for he loves you just the same  
Santa knows that we're God's children that makes everything right  
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
He'll come around when the chimes ring out it's Christmas morn again  
Peace on earth will come to all if we just follow the light  
Let's give thanks to the Lord above cause Santa Claus comes tonight
