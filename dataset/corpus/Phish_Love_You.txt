Honey, love ya honey little honey bunny Sunday mornin'  
Love ya more funny love in the skyline baby  
Ice cream 'scuse me I seen ya looking good the other evenin'.  
Oh, you dig it had to smile just an hour  
So if we're in love like I think we'll be  
It ain't a long rhyme it took ages to think  
I think I'll hurl it in the water baby.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Thinkin you are a nice little one  
To put it all around you it's just good  
I like it  
I like it.  
Hey Hey Hey suppose sometime that day  
You won't be swingin along over across to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Good time rocker woman,  
We'll stray our pieces  
Little creepy we shine so sleepy so whoopie!  
That's how you look.
