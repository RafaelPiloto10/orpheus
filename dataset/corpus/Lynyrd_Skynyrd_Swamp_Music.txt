Goin' down to the swamp  
Goin' watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon  
Well, I'm goin' down to the swamp  
Goin' to watch a hound dog catch a 'coon  
You know the hound dog makin' music  
On a summer night by the light of the moon  
  
Oh, fetch my cane pole mama  
Goin' catch a bream or maybe two  
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama  
Goin' catch a bream or maybe two  
When the hound dogs start barkin'  
Sound like ol' Son House singin' the blues  
  
Hound dog sing that  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
When the hound dog starts singin'  
I ain't got them big ol' city blues  
  
Go ahead pretty mamma  
Lord, just take that city hike  
Said, go ahead pretty mamma  
Lord, just take your city hike  
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life  
  
Singin' that  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life  
Well, I want to live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life
