Fuck yes  
Whew  
Always I'm locked in my head  
Know the pain, you don't know what I have had  
By now, I'm so for sure  
Right now, I am yours  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh Hell no)  
  
It came unknown to me  
Paranoid is controlling all of me  
Somehow turned so pure  
Right now, shit, I'm yours  
  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh hell no)  
Was it me? (I swallow)  
Forget me (I don't know)  
  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
This thing I follow  
The place I'm too scared to fucking go  
A freak that I'm sure  
A freak that is yours  
  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh hell no)  
Was it me? (I swallow)  
Forget me (I don't know)  
I swallow  
I swallow  
Freak  
  
[Repeat: x16]  
Punk ass sissy, I'm a freak
