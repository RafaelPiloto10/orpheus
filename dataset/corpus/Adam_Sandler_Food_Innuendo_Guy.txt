Oh yeah  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to stew your tomato  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to french fry your potato  
Baby, baby, baby, won't you pluck my grapes  
Won't you peel my banana like a pack of wild apes?  
I'm your food innuendo guy, your food innuendo guy  
  
Baby, baby, baby, you got honeydew melons  
Baby, baby, baby, can't you see my brocolli swelin  
Oh baby, baby, baby, I want to taste your watercress  
I want to slip my celery stick up the back of your dress  
I'm your food innuendo guy, your food innuendo guy  
  
Oh what will it take  
Don't go so soon  
You'll miss my carrot cake  
And my cream of mushroom  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, my jalapeno's red hot  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to stuff all that cabbage you got  
I'm your food innuendo guy, food innuendo guy  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you got eggplant parmigiana  
Baby, baby, baby, bite my zucchini if you want to  
I'll give you fresh fruit salad  
I don't get it from no can  
Your string bean days are over  
I'm your cucumber man  
I'm your food innuendo guy, food innuendo guy  
Oh so delicious
