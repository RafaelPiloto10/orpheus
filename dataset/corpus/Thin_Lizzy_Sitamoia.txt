Hey mister can i shine your shoes?  
Hey mister can i sing the blues?  
Hey mister do you think it's gonna snow?  
Hey mister my heart belongs to glasgow  
  
Hey mister can i ask a question or two?  
Hey mister what are we supposed to do?  
  
Children abandoned and left to america  
Children forsaken in ethiopia  
Hey mister so you think it's gonna snow?
