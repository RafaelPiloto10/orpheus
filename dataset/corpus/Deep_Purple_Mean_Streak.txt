She came home last night rotten rolling drunk  
She talk no sense but she sound good  
So she think So I reached over and said,  
"Hello, is there some planet you'd care to go"  
And she said "Venus on the rocks"  
  
She got a mean streak  
Black Mamba don't compete  
She got a mean streak  
Temptation bitter sweet  
  
She drives me crazy gets inside my brain  
She spend my money down a drain  
So I roll over for my reward  
How much can I afford  
And she says  
"Just a little more"  
  
I can't take this no more  
I tried so hard but I can't get thro' the door  
Because one smile from those eyes  
And I stand there paralyzed  
And she says  
"Beg for more get down sucka you know what I like"  
Oh hang on  
  
She got a mean streak  
Black Mamba don't compete  
She got a mean streak  
Temptation bitter sweet
