Blues for X'Mas  
Baby, I ain't got a dime  
Blues for X'Mas  
Baby, I ain't got a feakin' dime  
I'm just ain't and they're wasted  
I hang my head down baby  
I'm cryin'  
Baby, I'm cryin'  
Santa Clause  
Bring my Baby back on home  
See, I ain't got a lot of money  
But my baby she's rich enough for us both  
Blues for X'Mas  
I'm as blue as I can be  
Blues for X'Mas  
Baby, I'm as blue as I can be  
I'm just in here dinkin'  
Tryin' to drink my Baby back to me  
Tryin' to drink my Baby back  
Santa Clause  
Bring my Baby back on home  
Blues for X'Mas  
Ain't no time to be home all alone  
I can't lose these X'Mas Blues  
Baby, I just can't seem to shake off  
Held so many arms  
All I seem to do is break 'em  
Yeah, break 'em  
I said I break 'em, Baby
