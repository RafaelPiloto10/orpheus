There we were two lonely souls  
Existing from day to day  
Feeling love would never  
Come our way  
  
Watching lovers share their bliss  
Sadly wishing only if  
Believing that we had to live  
Life like this  
  
But like a bolt of lightning  
As when two stormy clouds collide  
We made a joyful happening  
To our lives  
  
Now we're happy as can be  
Me loving you and you loving me  
Two hearts intertwined  
Which makes us one of a kind  
  
Feeling the charge of a love evermore  
Knowing that love is enough to live for  
It feels so fine  
Sharing love one of a kind  
  
One of a kind now baby  
Your love and mine  
One of a kind, sweet darling  
The only way love is meant to be  
  
United love so fine  
Living in love one of a kind  
It feels nothing but fine  
Sharing our love one of a kind  
  
If we had a second chance  
At living a second time  
We'd change everything but our love  
In our lives  
  
Cause like a big disaster  
Lost in a never-ending night  
We light a light of magic  
Made everything right  
  
Now we're happy as can be  
Me loving you and you loving me  
Two hearts intertwined  
Which makes us one of a kind  
  
Feeling the charge of a love evermore  
Knowing that love is enough to live for  
It feels so fine  
Sharing love one of a kind  
  
One of a kind, now baby  
Your love and mine, such ecstasy  
One of a kind, sweet darling  
The only way love is meant to be
