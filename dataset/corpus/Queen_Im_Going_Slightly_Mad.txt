When the outside temperature rises  
And the meaning is oh so clear  
One thousand and one yellow daffodils  
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear  
Are they trying to tell you something ?  
You're missing that one final screw  
You're simply not in the pink my dear  
To be honest you haven't got a clue  
I'm going slightly mad  
I'm going slightly mad  
It finally happened - happened  
It finally happened - ooh woh  
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear !  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
I'm one card short of a full deck  
I'm not quite the shilling  
One wave short of a shipwreck  
I'm not my usual top billing  
I'm coming down with a fever  
I'm really out to sea  
This kettle is boiling over  
I think I'm a banana tree  
Oh dear  
I'm going slightly mad  
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)  
It finally happened - happened  
It finally happened - uh huh  
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear!  
  
Uh uh ah ah  
Uh uh ah ah  
  
I'm knitting with only one needle  
Unraveling fast it's true  
I'm driving only three wheels these days  
But my dear, how about you?  
I'm going slightly mad  
I'm going slightly mad  
It finally happened  
It finally happened - oh yes  
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad  
Just very slightly mad!  
And there you have it!
