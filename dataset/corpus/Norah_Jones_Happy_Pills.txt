Trying to pick up the pace  
Trying to make it so I never see your face again  
Trying to throw this away  
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again  
  
How does it feel?  
Oh how does it feel  
To be you right now dear?  
You brought this upon  
So pick up your piece and go away from here  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now?  
Please just let me go  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head,  
Get out  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head,  
Get out  
  
Never said we'd be friends,  
Trying to keep myself away from you,  
'Cause you're bad, bad news  
  
With you gone, I'm alive,  
Makes me feel like I took happy pills,  
And time stood still  
  
How does it feel?  
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out?  
You broke all the rules  
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now?  
Please just let me go  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head  
Get out  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head  
Get out
