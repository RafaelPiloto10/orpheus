I was a lover, a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy, my feet on the ground  
I didn't know I was on the way down  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
I had a billion or two in the bank  
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks  
You gave me all that a woman could give  
Less you're affection, I don't want to live  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
Cause you don't feel the same  
I was a lover, a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy, my feet on the ground  
I didn't know, I was on the way down  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game , it's only a game
