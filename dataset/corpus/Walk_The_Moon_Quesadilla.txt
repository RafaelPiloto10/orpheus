I must've stumble out of the plane  
Cause I free-fell all year  
My shoot is illuminous like spring  
And I'm nowhere now, but here  
  
But I've seen your long hair come down  
It turned my head inside out  
And I want you, I want you  
I still do  
  
Your wrists were bound in my hands  
While I wash around my naked feet  
Your blue jeans over in the sand  
We were wrestling up in the blanket sheets  
  
But I've seen your long hair come down  
(seen your long hair come down)  
Turned my head inside out  
(turned my head inside out)  
  
And I want you, I want you  
I still do  
I still, I still do  
  
I've seen your long hair come down  
And turned my head inside out  
But I've seen your long hair come down  
Turned my head inside out
