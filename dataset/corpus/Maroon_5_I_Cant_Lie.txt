I must have been a fool  
To love you so hard for so long  
So much stronger than before  
But so much harder to move on  
And now the bitter chill of the winter  
Still blows through me like a plague  
Only to wake up with an empty bed  
On a perfect summer day  
  
My world just feels so cold  
And you find yourself walking down  
The wrong side of the road  
Ow!  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
I never did my best to express how I really felt  
And now that I know exactly what I want  
You found somebody else  
  
Ooh my world just feels so cold  
And you find yourself walking on  
The wrong side of the road  
Oh yeah  
  
I can't lie your on my mind stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, oh)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
  
My world just feels so cold  
And I find myself thinking about the things I could have done  
And it warms my soul when you let me know  
I'm not the only one  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
(I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head)  
(I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah)  
(I just die so much inside now that you're not there)  
(I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday)
