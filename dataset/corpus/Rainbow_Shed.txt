I'm like a freight train feelin' no pain  
I never turn back one track  
Better step aside  
  
Like a shotgun  
I'm really someone  
You'll feel my heatwave  
Won't save anyone near to me  
  
I'm steel  
So come and try to bend me if you can, hah  
I don't feel  
Before you know it it's over  
Get out of my way  
I'm street walking, street walking  
Night stalking, I'm street walking  
  
No reputation  
You better quick run  
Cause I got no time I'll climb all over you  
  
You need a strong hand  
To be a mean man  
You've got to think fast  
I'll last longer than you could know  
  
I'm steel  
So won't you come and try to bend me if you can  
I don't feel  
Before you know it it's over  
Out of my way  
I'm street walking  
  
Hey, I'm a wild cat  
Don't need to prove that  
I'm always howlin' prowlin'  
Stalkin' my prey  
  
It could be your night  
To feel the dog bite  
And hear the slashing, crashin'  
Tearin' inside of you  
  
I'm steel  
So come and try to break me if you can, no way  
Like a wheel  
About to roll you over  
Get out of my way  
I'm street walkin', street walkin'  
No talkin', street walking  
Night stalking, street walking  
No talkin', I'm street walkin', yeah  
Street walkin', street walkin'  
Night stalking, street walking
