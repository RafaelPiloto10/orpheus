What would I have to do  
To get you to notice me too  
Do I  
Stand in line  
One of a million  
Admiring eyes  
  
Walk a tightrope way up high  
Write your name across the sky  
  
I'm going crazy just to let you know  
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby  
When I get my hands on you I won't let go  
This time I know it's for real  
  
Should I write or call your home  
Shout it out with a megaphone  
Radio, tv news  
Got to find a way  
To get the message to you  
  
To say I love you with a neon sign  
Anything to make you mine  
  
I'm going crazy just to let you know  
If I wait too long for you I might explode, oh baby  
I've been around the block enough to know  
This time I know it's for real  
  
Ooo baby  
This time, this time, this time, this time  
Oh baby  
This time, this time, oh baby  
  
Walk a tightrope way up high  
Write your name across the sky  
  
I'm going crazy just to let you know  
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, oh baby  
When I get my hands on you I won't let go  
This time I know it's for real  
  
I'm going crazy just to let you know  
If I wait too long for you I might explode, oh baby  
I've been around the block enough to know  
This time I know it's for real
