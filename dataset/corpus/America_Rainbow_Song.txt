Window frames a picture of winter time within my room  
Sometimes then i laugh at the funny times we had in school  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
Can you feel it moving inside of you? can you let it go?  
The purple ghost of england in winter time, and who i used to know  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am a sleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride
