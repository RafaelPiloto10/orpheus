Blue Spanish eyes,  
teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes Please,  
please don't cry, this is just "adios" and not "goodbye"  
Soon I'll return bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
  
Please say, say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me Blue Spanish eyes,  
prettiest eyes in all of Mexico True Spanish eyes,  
please smile for me once more before I go  
Soon I'll return bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
  
Please say, say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
You and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
