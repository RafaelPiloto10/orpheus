As I stand at the crossroad,  
I see the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision,  
I can't tell which way to go  
Now I have seen the seven wonders  
And I have sailed the seven seas,  
I've walked and talked with angels,  
And danced all night with gypsy queens  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way  
But, I still pray for tomorrow,  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away  
Don't fade away  
  
I have painted many portraits,  
Memories of love and pain,  
Though cut down by life's deceptions  
I found the strength to start again  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way  
But, I still pray for tomorrow,  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away  
Don't fade away.  
  
Heaven help a man  
Trying to make up his mind,  
With the darkness closing in,  
I feel I'm running out of time  
Shine a light for me,  
Help me find the way to go,  
And take me where I've never been before  
  
And so I stand at the crossroad,  
Watching the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision,  
Trying to find the way to go  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way,  
But, I still pray for tomorrow  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away
