I believe I'm John Wayne  
They call me John Wayne  
  
You know you've got it coming  
I'll tell it to you straight  
I'm coming for you very soon  
I'll never hesitate  
  
I've come to measure you  
I will fit you up  
I've come to measure you  
Fit you up  
  
I am John Wayne  
I believe I'm John Wayne  
They call me John Wayne  
  
You felt the money flowing  
You watched the beast arrive  
You felt your money going away  
And tried to skin the lamb alive  
  
Come to measure you  
Fit you up  
I come to measure you  
Fit you up  
  
I am John Wayne  
I am John Wayne  
They tell me I am, the John Wayne  
  
Coming very soon  
I'm coming for you  
Any day now  
  
Don't you dare look behind you  
For you know I will be there  
You'll feel my breath on your neck  
Turn, face me if you dare  
  
I've come to measure you  
I've come to fix you up  
I've come to measure you  
Fix you up  
  
I am John Wayne  
I believe I'm John Wayne  
You know, my name is John Wayne  
Get on your horse  
  
Measure you  
This man has come to measure you, measure you, measure you  
Measure you  
This man, this man and that man come to measure you  
  
I say, measure you  
Coming inch by inch like a marigold line  
Smiling inchworm like a marigold line  
Inch my way, measure you  
  
Measure you, measure you  
I come to measure you  
I come to measure you  
I come to measure you
