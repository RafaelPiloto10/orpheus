Salvadori, you can def'  
Be my baby boo,  
Need my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high.  
Back to Malibu, and our,  
Trailer park for two,  
We're like sitting in see love gonna fight.  
  
We got a jumper, got a jumper,  
Got a jumper, got a jumper,  
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right.  
But I like him, fact I love him,  
I can't get e-enough of him,  
He knows only I can save him tonight.  
  
I've been waiting on your love,  
Baby, for too long now, too long now.  
I thought that I could change you,  
Like the others but I don't know how,  
Don't know how.  
  
It's gonna backfire,  
It's gonna backfire, baby.  
Gonna backfire,  
Gonna backfire, baby.  
  
Told you one million times before,  
You're so much firing a million more.  
  
I'm tired of fighting you,  
Seems like everything I do,  
Even when I win I lose what you meant.  
And it's not something you chose,  
You say trouble follows you,  
It's been like that since the day you began.  
  
We got a jumper, got a jumper,  
Got a jumper, got a jumper,  
I know very well you're bringing me down.  
I will follow, I will follow,  
I will follow, for a little piece of heaven,  
I'm ready, I am willing to drown.  
  
I've been waiting on your love,  
Baby, for too long now, too long now.  
I thought that I could change you,  
Like the others but I don't know how,  
Don't know how.  
  
It's gonna backfire,  
It's gonna backfire, baby.  
Gonna backfire,  
Gonna backfire, baby.  
  
Told you one million times before,  
You're so much firing a million more.  
  
You're always taking trips downtown,  
Officer Brown's always coming around.  
Tappin' on the window, kids come out,  
Ain't no way to live when we show you how.  
  
But we know we're not gonna change,  
Keep hustlin', every night and day.  
  
I've been waiting on your love,  
Baby, for too long now, too long now.  
I thought that I could change you,  
Like the others but I don't know how,  
Don't know how.  
  
It's gonna backfire,  
It's gonna backfire, baby.  
Gonna backfire,  
Gonna backfire, baby.  
  
Done it a million times before,  
And I won't fire it a million more
