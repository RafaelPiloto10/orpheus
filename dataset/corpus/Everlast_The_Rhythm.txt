I'm Everlast born to be a caucassion but it makes no difference what
persuasion you are  
As long as you know how to get up on the floor and start workin' a sweat  
To a musical measure that makes you move as soon as the needle drops into the
groove  
So get up and dance to the gift I'm giving, forget about your troubles get
into the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Yo, yo, you know what the world needs...we need peace, rhythm  
The rhythm

You linger for the rap singer, when Donald D brings the party to the deal my
presence is felt world wide  
You don't dance to this it's suicide  
Put your hands into the air on, the M.C. cop, the girlies are pipen' hot  
Natorious Lama is how I'm livin' don't step to me step to the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
You make me feel so good  
Like I said before the world needs a lot more rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Listen to the tracks that rolls, watch the mic as it glows  
The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode  
Ice-T's throwin' words at you like dodge ball y'all  
You gotta move get hit, if you get hit, you fall, no jokin', no boastin' and
no bragging  
Grip the mic like a .44 magnum, dust you off if you suck 'cause I ain't  
You want me to write soft rhyme's, sorry, I write the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
We need rhythm for the world to have peace and unity, we must first have
rhythm
