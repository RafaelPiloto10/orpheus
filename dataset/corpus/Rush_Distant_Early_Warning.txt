An ill wind comes arising  
Across the cities of the plain  
There's no swimming in the heavy water  
No singing in the acid rain  
Red alert  
Red alert  
  
It's so hard to stay together  
Passing through revolving doors  
We need someone to talk to  
And someone to sweep the floors  
Incomplete  
Incomplete  
  
[Chorus:]  
The world weighs on my shoulders  
But what am I to do?  
You sometimes drive me crazy  
But I worry about you  
I know it makes no difference  
To what you're going through  
But I see the tip of the iceberg  
And I worry about you...  
  
Cruising under your radar  
Watching from satellites  
Take a page from the red book  
Keep them in your sights  
Red alert  
Red alert  
  
Left and rights of passage  
Black and whites of youth  
Who can face the knowledge  
That the truth is not the truth?  
Obsolete  
Absolute  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Absalom, Absalom, Absalom
