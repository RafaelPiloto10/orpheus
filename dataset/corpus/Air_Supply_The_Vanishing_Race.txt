Sun, I can't slow you down  
Run, build on sacred ground  
All of the leavesd have blown away  
Ghosts on a distant highway  
In a vanishing race  
  
Sleep, if your eyes must close  
Weep, over a poisoned rose  
Soon all the tears will blow away  
Dust on a distant highway  
In the vanishing race  
  
Fly, closer to the sun  
Fight, 'till your world is one  
Soon all the stars will burn away  
Ghosts on a different highway  
In the vanishing race  
  
Oh, shall we sleep tonight  
Take all your dreams and drive away  
Smoke on a distant highway  
From the vanishing race  
  
All my people  
Respect your Mother Earth  
Thank you for this life and this breath  
And all my people's strength
