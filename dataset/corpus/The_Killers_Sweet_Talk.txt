Lift me up on my honour  
Take me over this spell  
Get this weight of my shoulder  
I carried it well  
Loose these shackles of pressure  
Shake me out of these chains  
Lead me not to temptation  
Hold my hand harder  
Ease my mind  
Roll down the smokescreen  
And open the sky  
  
Let me fly  
Then I need a release from  
These troubles of mine  
Fix my feet  
When they're stumbling  
And well you know it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
  
Dig me out from this thorn tree  
Help me bury my shame  
Keep my eyes from the fire  
They can't handle the flame  
They've cut out from my brothers  
When most of them fail  
I carried it well  
  
Let me fly  
Then I need a release from  
These troubles of mine  
Fix my feet  
When they're stumbling  
I guess you know it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
  
Now hold on  
I'm not looking for sweet talk  
I'm looking for time  
Time for towering sweet folk  
Brother 'cause it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
Hold on  
  
You know it's going to hurt sometimes  
When you call me  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
  
I'm going to climb that symphony home  
And make it mine  
And this pleasure is mine  
Mark my way  
See all these pessimistic sufferers  
Tend to drag me down  
So I could use it to shelter  
What good I've found
