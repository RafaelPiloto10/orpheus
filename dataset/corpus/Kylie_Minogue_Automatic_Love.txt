Wake up baby give yourself to me  
I'm the one for  
I'll show you intimacy  
Forever no question unbridle my affection  
And you will feel my love explode  
In your direction  
Automatic Love  
Automatic love (automatic automatic)  
Won't you please forgive me  
I feel a stranger here  
It seems that I lost all my memories  
and all of my fears  
I know I'm so crazy  
I don't care  
cause it's you that makes me so beware  
You put me on automatic love  
There's no return I'm on  
Automatic love  
Nothing can stop me I'm on  
Automatic love  
Come one and turn it on (automatic automatic)  
Turn it on  
I didn't feel you enter in my main menu  
But every time I touch the key  
The screen is showing you  
  
I know I'm so crazy  
I don't care  
'Cause it's you that makes me so beware  
You put me on automatic love  
There's no return I'm on  
Automatic love  
Nothing can stop me I'm on  
Automatic love  
Come one and turn it on (automatic automatic)  
Turn it on  
No manual control, it's automatic  
Oh so beware  
You put me on  
Whoa Oh Oh  
Automatic love  
There's no return I'm on  
Automatic love  
Nothing can stop me I'm on  
Automatic love  
Come one and turn it on (automatic automatic)
