There's a secret that I know about the lady that I love so  
And I'm the only one she's shown her secret to  
She's gentle and she's kind  
She's proper and refine  
But she lets down more than her hair  
Alone in our room  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she's more than a lady  
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes  
She's more than a lady  
And every night when we lay down  
And she slips off her satin gown  
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
  
When we go out somewhere  
The men may stop and stare  
But they see she's a lady  
So they leave her alone  
She's more than she seems  
And in their wildest dreams  
They could never dream of what it's like to take her home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise
