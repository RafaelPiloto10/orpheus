Troubled little angel  
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time  
Drama queen  
  
Preening and untangling  
Feathers in her wings  
Captured by her dreams  
Desperately she sings  
  
[Chorus]  
Needy little baby  
Open up your heart  
Don't you be afraid to feel  
Needy little baby  
Hiding' deep inside  
Don't you know your love can heal  
  
Troubled little angel  
Inconsistent  
Flying blind most of the time  
Don't know who to be (Yeah)  
Always rearranging the wreckage of her life  
Ever holding tight to the hope that she'll be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm talking to you angel  
Angel  
Deep inside of me  
I'm talking to you angel  
Angel  
One day you'll be free  
  
Angel (Angel)  
Angel (Angel)  
Deep inside of me (Inside, inside)  
Talking to you angel (Angel)  
Angle (Angel)  
You'll be free
