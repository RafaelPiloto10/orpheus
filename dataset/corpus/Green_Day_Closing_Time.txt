Song: Closing Time  
Artist(band): "Semisonic"  
Verse I  
Closing time, open all the doors and let you out into the world  
Closing time, turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl  
Closing time, one last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer  
Closing time, you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
Verse 2  
Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from  
Closing time, this room won't be open till your brother's or your sister's
come  
So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits, I hope you have found a
friend.  
Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end, yeah  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
Bridge  
Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from...  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
End  
Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end...
