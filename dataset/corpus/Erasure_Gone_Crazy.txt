I guess I'm leaving on that train tomorrow  
Yeah, I'm leaving and I'm not coming home  
I'm not playing stupid games no more  
Knocked me down again onto the floor  
I believe it's something we could talk about  
I believe there was one time we might work it out  
Oh no, now I don't know  
I've gone crazy thinking about you  
Walk away is all I can do  
What's the difference, one more lie  
Let's pretend and say goodbye  
And now it's over, early morning rising  
People walking, faces I don't see  
Rain is falling, it don't mean a thing  
Gray clouds forming in this world I'm in  
I believe that I could make you happy one more time  
Maybe we took each other for another ride  
Now, I don't know  
I've gone crazy thinking about you  
Walk away is all I can do  
What's the difference, one more lie  
Let's pretend and say goodbye  
I believe that I could make you happy one more time  
Maybe we took each other for another ride  
Now, I don't know  
I've gone crazy thinking about you  
Walk away is all I can do  
What's the difference, one more lie  
Let's pretend and say goodbye  
I've gone crazy thinking about you  
Walk away is all I can do  
What's the difference, one more lie  
Let's pretend and say goodbye
