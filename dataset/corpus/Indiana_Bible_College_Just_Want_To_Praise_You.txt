[Verse:]  
There's a man on the corner walking up and down the street  
He's been homeless for a while, but he makes it to church each week  
And he's thankful to wake up and take another breath each day  
You might not think he has a reason, but if you'll listen close he'll say  
  
[Chorus:]  
I just wanna praise You For ev'ry little thing You do  
When my world's turned upside down  
You turn it around  
Ev'ry trial sent my way, is ordering the steps I take  
When the storms of life get rough I'll lift Your name  
I just wanna give You praise  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I get impatient ev'ry once in a while when I can't see  
Your plan The trials come along and it makes it hard to even stand  
But, in the middle of the battle I find Your hand to hold on to  
And I realize ev'rything is possible because of You  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag]  
And I wanna thank You For all the little things that You've done for me  
You've given me a song, strength to carry on I'll forever sing  
  
[Chorus:] 2x
