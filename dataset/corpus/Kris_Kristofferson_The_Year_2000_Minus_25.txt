Welcome to the years 2000 minus 25, oh say can you smell her for the smoke  
God's still up there laughin', so she's gotta be alive  
Who says he can't take a dirty joke  
  
Power isn't power does and power slips away, it's so easy to abuse  
Who'd've thought them Arabs would've brought the USA just to give it to the
Jews  
Singing crime still don't pay just like it used to  
And you know this time slips away 'til you die  
  
Well I don't give a damn when I choose to, no it don't hurt so bad when you're
high  
Oh say, does the future of the homesick and the brave even matter anymore  
There ain't no more reason for them boys to run away than there was to fight
before  
Would you tell me why the hell we'd try  
To win back in a war what we lost in the last  
  
Might just ain't as righteous as it used to be, before when your army's out of
gas  
Singing crime still don't pay...  
Singing crime still don't pay...
