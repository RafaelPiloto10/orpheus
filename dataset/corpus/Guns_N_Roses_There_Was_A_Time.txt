Broken glass and cigarettes,  
Writing on the wall,  
It was a bargain for the summer,  
And I thought I had it all.  
I was the one who gave you everything,  
The one who took the fall,  
You were the one who would do anything,  
The one who can't recall  
Where she was while she was sleeping,  
In another woman's bed,  
Or the doctors or the lawyers,  
Or a stranger that she met.  
If there's nothing I can gain from this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the knowledge that ya gave me,  
When I thought I had it all.  
  
It was a long time with you,  
It was a long time with me,  
It'd be a long for anyone,  
But looks like it's meant to be.  
  
Social class and registers,  
Cocaine in the hall,  
All the way from California,  
On the way beyond that stall.  
To those non-negotiations  
To simulate a call,  
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you  
  
Up and sitting pretty,  
On a pedestal of men  
And now you're sleeping like an angel,  
Near the man who reaped it in.  
  
If there's something I can make of this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all.  
  
It was a wrong time for you,  
It was a wrong time for me,  
It was the wrong time for everyone  
But looks like I'm about to see for myself.  
  
If I could go back in time to the place in my soul,there all alone  
Lonely tear drops,  
Ooh,are calling you.  
But I don't wanna know it now,  
'cause knowing you, it won't change a damn thing.  
But there was a time.  
  
Yeah, there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all and  
I don't wanna know it now  
  
Oh,  
  
Yeah, there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all and  
I don't wanna know it now,  
  
Oh,  
I would do anything for you,  
There was a time,  
I would do anything for you,  
Oh,I would do anything for you,  
There was a time.  
  
There was a time,  
Oh, I would do anything for you,  
Oh, I would do anything for you  
Yeah there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
And I don't wanna know it now,  
I would do anything for you,  
There was a time, was a time
