(Remix) I love her 'cause she got her own  
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone  
There ain't nothing that's more sexy, then a girl  
That want but don't need me  
Young independent (yea she work hard)  
But you can't tell from the way that she walk  
She don't slow down, 'cause she ain't got time  
To be complaining, shawty goin' shine  
She don't expect nothing from no guy  
She plays aggressive, but she still shy  
But you never know her softer side,  
By looking in her eyes  
Knowing she can do for herself  
Makes me wanna give her my wealth  
Only kinda girl I want,  
Independent queen,  
Workin' for her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
I love her 'cause she got her own, she got her own  
I love her 'cause she got her own  
She got her own (I love it when she say)  
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it  
(I love it when she say) it's cool I got it, I got it, I got it (Remix)  
  
I love her 'cause she got her own  
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone  
There ain't nothing that's more sexy,  
Then a girl that want but don't need me  
Lovely face, nice thick thighs,  
Plus she got drive that matches my drive  
Sexy thing, she's Ms. Fly  
All the while paying her bills on time  
She don't look at me like captain save 'em  
Gold digging, no she don't do that  
Now she look at me like inspiration,  
She wanna be complimenting my swag  
And everything she got, she work for it,  
Good life made for it, she take pride in saying  
That she paid for it, only kind of girl I want  
Independent queen, working for her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too,  
Make you even have to but even if I had to  
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to  
When I do that math boo, you always try and add two  
I need someone who ride for me  
Not someone who ride for free  
She say boy I don't just ride  
She'll pull up beside of me, I had to ask her  
What she doing in that caddy  
She say cause you my baby  
I'll be stunting like my daddy  
And there's not many, who catch my eye  
We both wearin' Gucci, she match my fly  
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer  
Right by my side toaster in the holster  
And now she went Loso case you didn't know so  
You can save your money dog, shawty getting dough so  
What she care what his cost, you can call her miss boss  
I got it backwards, Kriss Kross shawty got her own  
  
Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing,  
'Cept some of that good lovin' let me here you say oh oh oh oh  
  
And all my fellas know you need to stop the frontin'  
if you love an independent woman let me hear you say oh oh oh oh  
  
I love her cause she got her own (got her own)  
I love her cause she got her own (she got her own)  
I love it when she say It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it  
I love it when she say uh uh, I got it, I got it, I got it
