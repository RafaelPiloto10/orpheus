Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin,  
I've been ready.  
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim,  
I've been ready.  
  
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream.  
Loving every second, ev'ry moment, ev'ry scream,  
I've been waiting so long to sing my song  
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come.  
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one.  
  
Roll out! Roll out with your American dream and its recruits,  
I've been ready.  
Roll out! Roll out with your circus freaks and hula hoops,  
I've been ready.  
  
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream.  
Loving every second, ev'ry moment, ev'ry scream,  
I've been waiting so long to sing my song  
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come.  
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one.  
  
I can stand here strong and thin.  
I can laugh when this thing begins.  
  
God, I feel so strong.  
I feel so strong.  
I'm so strong.  
I feel so strong.  
So strong.  
God, I feel so strong,  
I am so strong.
