Island in the sea  
Are so much like me  
They don't ever change--no emotion, no emotion  
Islands on the land  
Dry like desert sand  
Island in the city  
All alone it's such a pity  
CHORUS  
It's just a masquerade  
Just painted laces  
When will it change  
Never  
Islands in the seas  
What's come over me  
We are both surrounded by the water--empty water  
Give me mystery--and the fear it brings  
Anything at all to break up the monotony  
CHORUS  
Islands in the sea  
Forever . . . forever
