"My gaurdian angel wears a hard hat,"  
Said the boy with the microphone  
"Else, I wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little young a boy  
I couldn't leave well enough alone  
When trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
  
Hard living be the death of me  
Yes gonna lead me to an early grave  
To die in the saddle must be my destiny  
But to ride this rocking horse I must be crazed  
  
Good clean fun is just my imagination  
Down and dirty that's the way the game is played  
This hard life has caused me aggravation  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh no now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Ohh I gotta ride that rocking horse  
  
Talking, about my guardian angel, she wears a hard hat  
Wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little bitty young boy  
Been trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh now now now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Gotta ride my rockin' horse
