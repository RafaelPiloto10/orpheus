Never could say what I want to say  
Never could do what I want to do  
Never could believe you, if it's true  
Never could, never would, you make it so hard  
I never want to leave you  
I'm always right, you're never wrong  
We change the tune but not the song  
Over and over  
Till it's done, it's never done, never done  
You make it so hard  
Never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
  
Movin' together, comin' apart  
You're what I need, I'm what you want  
Never could refuse you from the start  
Never could, never would, never could  
You make it so hard  
  
Never could say what I want to say  
Never could do what I want to do  
Never could believe you, if it's true  
Never could, never would, you make it so hard  
  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
Never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to
