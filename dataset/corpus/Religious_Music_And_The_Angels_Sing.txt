We meet, and the angels sing  
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard  
You speak, and the angels sing  
Or am I breathing music into ev'ry word?  
  
Suddenly, the setting is strange  
I can see water and moonlight beaming  
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore  
Then suddenly, I see it all change  
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming  
Through it all your face that I adore.  
  
You smile, and the angels sing  
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start  
We kiss, and the angels sing  
And leave their music ringing in my heart...
