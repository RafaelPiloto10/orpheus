When I was a kid I wanted to grow up and be cop in a province town or county  
I thought it would be great if someday I could only ever be a mountie  
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because that's part of the
profession  
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliament's in
session  
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every
parade  
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending my career in
motorcades  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I used to think that a mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble, strong and
thrifty  
But even though we don't break ranks, we get no thanks, they took us off the
fifty (dollar bill)  
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls, it's
such a pain  
Like someone's plotting the assassination of the Minister if Sports and
Recreation, oh that's insane  
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dudley Do-
Right's such a jerk (Damn you, Snidely)  
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a golfing
cart, some days I hate to go to work  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me

Oh, no, it's not the life for me  
Oh, no, it's not the life for me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-
me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me
