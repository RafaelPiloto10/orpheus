Oh so fine  
We were trying  
Out of nowhere  
Just in time  
Let you take me  
Deep down the river  
Kiss the changes  
That shape my life  
Always  
Left behind  
All the tracks that  
I could find  
Do do do do do  
All these scars are mine  
  
I was thinking got the feeling  
The gift you gave  
Is gonna last forever  
  
All the lies you find  
All the truth you see  
Rise and fall  
But I know what's mine  
  
Here we lie  
Looking up to  
Empty sky  
And the promises we find  
I'm not the first one  
To ask why  
  
I was thinking  
Got the feeling  
The gift you gave  
Is gonna last forever
