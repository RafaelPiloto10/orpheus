Well, all I want is a love that's hot  
Can't be sold, can't be bought  
Yeah, love that don't try to be somethin' it's not  
  
Well, all I need is a love that's real  
None can rob and none can steal  
Hey, love that moves like a drivin' wheel  
  
Well, all I want is drivin' wheel  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
All 'round love my ideal  
  
Well, all I want is love that's right  
To hold onto with all my might  
Hey, early in the mornin' and late at night  
  
Well, all I want is drivin' wheel  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
Hey, all 'round love my ideal  
  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
Hey, all 'round love my ideal  
  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
All I want is a drivin' wheel  
Well, all 'round love my ideal
