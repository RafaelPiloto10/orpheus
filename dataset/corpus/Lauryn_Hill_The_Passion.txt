If they only owned love, shown love, grown love, like this before  
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before  
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before  
If they only called love, love love, called love, like this before  
  
If they'd only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before  
If they only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before  
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before  
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before  
If they only showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before  
  
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, La la la la la...  
Like this before  
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, they owed love  
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah  
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la...  
  
If they only claimed love, claimed love, claimed love  
They maintained love  
Instead they drained love, stained love  
They didn't control love, my soul loves a whole love, like this before  
  
Received the same love  
If they didn't regret love, forget love, say they never met love  
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love [Repeat: x 4]
