As we stood there older than men  
And younger than the boys (that's right)  
We were as still as the wind  
That blows on a hot August night  
  
And you were lonesome  
As a jukebox  
But deadly just the same  
I could be as gentle as a newborn  
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane  
  
And we knew how to laugh  
And we knew how to cry  
Yeah, we sure knew how to live  
But we don't ever  
  
Never say die  
Never say die  
  
I guess you'd say we had a pact  
These words we knew so well (that's right)  
Still they remained unspoken  
And we'd take them to the fiery  
Gates of hell  
  
Once I was afraid of love  
But when it's your brother  
Those things change  
'Cause love is just another word  
For trust  
So hear me when I say  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die  
  
Yeah, and we could run like lightning  
Through the pouring rain  
And we'll be standing like a soldier  
Who comes marching home again  
  
They ask what it is that I want written  
On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry  
  
My spirit is still riding somewhere  
Somewhere in this night  
When it's these three words that come to me  
As I kiss this world goodbye  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die
