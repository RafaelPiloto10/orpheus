I want to see you again.  
I don't care where and I don't care when.  
I want to see you again,  
Cause this beginning will have no end.  
Bring your whips, bring your chains.  
We can exchange names.  
I want to see you again.  
I want to see you again.  
I feel a feeling since I don't know when.  
I want to see you again,  
So you can know you have a friend.  
You're so passive.  
I'm filled with wrath.  
We could take a bath.  
I want to see you again.  
Oh, there's talk of the lights on Broadway  
And hearts intertwining high above,  
And if frankly we'll see things my way,  
We will climb the heights of love.  
I want to see you again.  
It doesn't matter where or when.  
I want to see you again.  
I'm just beginning to have no end.  
Perfect love.  
Cast out fear.  
Let me, buy you a beer.  
I want to see you again,  
And again,  
And again.  
I want to see you again.  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again
