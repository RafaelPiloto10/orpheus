The first circle comes around  
You don't want to leave her side  
You're staying in and don't go out  
You're having such a perfect time  
You make your bed and you lie in it  
And time is precious every minute  
The next circle comes around  
And so domestic you become  
In your matching dressing gowns  
You think your life time's just begun  
You cut the cake but just the one slice  
You're crawling back all through the night  
  
Love circles up above  
It waits until your love  
Breaks down and weeps  
Then it's out of your reach  
Love circles up above  
It waits for your love  
Down on the floor  
Then you're there in its claws  
Love circles up above  
  
The last circle comes around  
You're making plans to fill your days  
You're always wanting to stay out late  
And you can feel love start to fade  
You fall asleep or read a book  
The phone goes back upon the hook  
  
When I lay awake at night  
And love can't be found  
The first circle's on my mind  
It goes round and round and round and round
