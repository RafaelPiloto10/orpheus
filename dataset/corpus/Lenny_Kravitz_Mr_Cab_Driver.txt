Mr. Cab Driver won't you stop to let me in  
Mr. Cab Driver don't you like my kind of skin  
Mr. Cab Driver you're never gonna win  
  
Mr. Cab Driver won't stop to pick me up  
Mr. Cab Driver I might need some help  
Mr. Cab Driver only thinks about himself  
  
Mr. Cab Driver  
Mr. Cab Driver  
  
Mr. Cab Driver don't like to way I look  
He don't like dreads he thinks we're all crooks  
Mr. Cab Driver reads too many story books  
  
Mr. Cab Driver pass me up with eyes of fire  
Mr. Cab Driver thinks we're all 165'ers  
Mr. Cab Driver fuck you I'm a survivor  
  
Let me in  
  
Mr. Cab Driver  
Mr. Cab Driver
