Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
(JESY)  
I feel the rain on my skin  
Wash away all the pain I was in  
I see the sun in the sky  
No longer know how it feels to cry  
  
(JADE)  
And it really doesn't matter, so what, so what?  
That I've been hesitating so long, so long  
Somebody turn up the lights  
'Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
(ALL)  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
Drop me in the ocean, I'll swim  
Throw me in with the lions, I'll roar  
There's a survivor within  
So much stronger than I was before  
  
(PERRIE)  
They never saw me coming, so what, so what?  
'Cause they've been sleeping on me so long, so long  
I gotta leave that behind  
'Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
(ALL)  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Now...  
  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now
