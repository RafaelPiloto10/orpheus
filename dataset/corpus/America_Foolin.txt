You let me follow you around  
It helped your status in the town  
Well I didn't know your name  
There's no truth in what you claim  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
I think it's called a lesson learned  
When one so close suddenly turns  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Now it's my time to make amends  
Hope my message don't offend  
And I hope this doesn't drive you round the bend  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
(Repeat and fade)
