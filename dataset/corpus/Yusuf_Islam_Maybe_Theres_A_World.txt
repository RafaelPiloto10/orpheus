I have dreamt of a place and time  
Where nobody gets annoyed  
But I must admit, I'm not there yet  
But something's keeping me going  
  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Open up, oh world and let me in  
Then there'll be a new life to begin  
  
I have dreamt of an open world  
Borderless and wide  
Where the people move from place to place  
And nobody's taking sides  
  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Open up, oh world and let me in  
Then there'll be a new life to begin  
  
I've been waiting for that moment  
To arrive  
All at once, the palace of peace  
Will fill my eyes, how nice  
  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find  
Open up, oh world and let me in  
Then there'll be a new life to begin  
  
I've been waiting for that moment  
To arrive  
All at once, the wrongs of the world  
Will be put right, how nice
