(Violent J talking)  
This a... Strange...(voices)... This, there's many, many voices in my head,  
Many different voices(some are like this)some are like this(some are like  
This)some are like this(some are like this)some are like this, some are like  
This(mumbling)  
  
(Violent J)  
I hear voices, one voice in paticular  
It comes into my mind, perpendicular  
Rectangular, it's a.. Strangular  
He's like some kind of mental fuckin' mangular... I dunno  
He tells me to punch Esham and Shaggs  
So I punch'em, I even call Twiztid fags  
They get mad, slap me and smear my makeup  
I've named this evil voice, named him Jacob  
Jacob tells me "climb the ladder and jump off"  
"Head first on the street, don't worry, it's soft"  
So I jump, thump, I'm on a gurney  
Jacob laughs at me "your so fuckin' nerdy"  
Fuck him, I hate him, I can't escape him!  
I finally get alone, he calls me on the telephone  
"Brrb" "is Violent J there?" here "hey it's Jacob!"  
"I want you to piss in your underware, ok bud?"  
Sure, I'm pissin' now, it fuckin' tickles  
Jacobs dissin' again, I hear his giggles  
After I cut all my fingers of for that mother fucker  
I've finally had enough  
Go see a doctor, Doc, hello  
"Hi, have a seat, let's see umm... What is it.. Joe?  
Yeah, Joe Bruce, my friends call my Chucky "Chucky?"  
Either that or Bucky, fuck Me!!  
I'm sorry Doc, it's Jacob again, my name's J  
"Tell me J, who's this Jacob anyway?"  
I fucking want him dead, it's a voice in my head  
I gotta lotta voices, but this one's mislead  
He tells me to drink toilet water an shit  
"Do you do it?" No.. Yes!!  
I can't help it though, I can't stop it  
"J..what I want you to do is drop it" Drop what?
