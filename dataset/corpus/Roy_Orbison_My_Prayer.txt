When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing  
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart  
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray  
  
My prayer is to linger with you  
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine  
My prayer is a rapture in blue  
With the world far away and your lips close to mine  
  
Tonight while our hearts are aglow  
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know  
  
My prayer and the answer you give  
May they still be the same for as long as we live  
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer
