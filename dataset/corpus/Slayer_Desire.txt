No one could ever doubt my rapture  
As you too will soon discover  
No one will ever cross my love  
Deadly consequence will rise above  
  
Lying all alone  
Visions of erotic bliss  
Feel your warmth from inside your skin  
A fever I can not resist  
  
Desire I would kill for you  
Right or wrong I'd do anything  
True and pure the intensity  
Every time death is next to me  
  
Lying all alone  
Visions of erotic bliss  
Feel your warmth from inside your skin  
A fever I can not resist  
  
Anxiously feeling grotesque  
Up against your flesh  
Forbidden fantasies  
Uncontrollable heat  
  
Find yourself all alone and dead  
Visions of corroding bliss  
Feel the warmth from inside your skin  
A sensation I can't resist
