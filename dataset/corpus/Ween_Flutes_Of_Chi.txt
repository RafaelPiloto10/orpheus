Everything that you are,  
That you'd like to be  
Will come in three, my friend  
  
Times thine inequity  
The flutes of the chi  
Will sound again, my friend  
  
Wrap yourself up in gold,  
The fruits of the old,  
Are ripe to be told, my friend  
  
For, it's not what you are,  
How you've come to be  
All this will will end and begin again  
  
Everything that you are,  
That you'd like to be  
Will come in three, my friend  
  
Times thine inequity,  
The flutes of the chi  
Will sound again, my friend
