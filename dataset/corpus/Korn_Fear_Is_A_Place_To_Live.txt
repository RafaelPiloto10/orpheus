I feel you all around me  
You voice, it surrounds me  
You keep telling me what I want to hear  
You're beautiful, so talented  
I need you, we got a thing  
You ever needs something I'll be right there  
  
Fear is a place to live  
Rip off the mask from your head  
Show me the real face that you hide  
  
I see you from a mile away  
Keep staring, acting like you gotta say  
You're beautiful, so talented  
I need you, we got a thing  
You ever needs something I'll be right there  
  
Fear is a place to live  
Rip off the mask from your head  
Show me the real face that you hide  
  
Fake ass people surround me  
They're always nice to begin  
Digging their claws  
  
Fake ass people surround me  
Digging their claws right in me  
They're always nice to begin but  
I always get fucked in the end
