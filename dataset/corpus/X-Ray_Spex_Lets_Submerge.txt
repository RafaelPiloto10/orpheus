It's dark and eerie  
And it's really late  
Come on kid's don't hesitate  
We're going down to the underground  
We're going down we're going down  
To the underground  
  
The Hades ladies are dressed to kill  
Dagger glares from Richard hell  
Tension heightening heating frightening  
Thunder rolls as fast as lightning  
  
If you've got the urge  
Come on let's submerge  
  
The subterranean is a bottomless pit  
The vinyl vultures are after it  
Molten lava sulfur vapors  
Smolder on to obliterate us  
  
If you've got the urge  
Come on let's submerge
