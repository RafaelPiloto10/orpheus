Herbert Sacker, Nina Simone  
Why you want to fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly  
No place bif enough for holding all the tears you're gonna cry  
'cause your mama's name was lonely and your daddy's name was pain  
And they call you little sorrow 'cause you'll never love again  
So why you want to fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly  
You ain't got no one to hold you you ain't got no one to care  
If you'd only understand dear nobody wants you anywhere  
So why you want to fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
