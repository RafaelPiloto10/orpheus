I'm sorry.  
Why should I say I'm sorry?  
If I hurt you,  
You know you've hurt me too.  
  
[Chorus:]  
But you get lost inside your tears,  
And there is nothing I can do,  
'Cause I get lost inside my fear  
That I am nothing without you.  
  
You're angry.  
Why shouldn't you be angry?  
With what we've been through,  
Well I get angry too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause I am nothing without you.  
  
Why should we have taken so long  
To be looking inside of our mind?  
Everything we tried went wrong.  
Are we worried 'bout what we might find?  
  
I'm sorry,  
But can I say I'm sorry?  
If I hurt you,  
You know it hurts me too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you get lost inside your tears,  
And there is nothing we can do,  
'Cause I get lost inside my fear  
That I am nothing without you.  
  
'Cause I am nothing without you.  
And I am nothing without you.  
'Cause I am nothing without you.  
'Cause I am nothing without you.
