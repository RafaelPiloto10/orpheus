Dark and dirty  
Like you have never seen  
A mind so twisted  
With thoughts so unclean.  
My heart is racing  
All tattered and torn  
I stand here naked  
As the day I was born.  
  
Over and over I stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
The sky is falling  
On this setting son  
Echoes of silence  
Ringing loud and long  
This isolation  
Is the king of pain  
A lost horizon  
In an ocean of flames  
  
Only the lonely will stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
I've been here before,  
But not as I stand here today  
I wait for the dawn  
Ready to walk  
Into the light
