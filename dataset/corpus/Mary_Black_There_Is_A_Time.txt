There is a time in life it seems  
For believing in dreams, for me it's gone  
And though I realize today  
Dreams are empty anyway, I still feel wronged.  
Chorus  
I felt cheated when you went away  
But not as defeated as I felt the day  
You came back and we found so little to say.  
There is a time in life I know  
When we all must outgrow young ideals  
And the wisdom that we gain  
Is paid for with the pain I now feel.  
Chorus  
There is a time in life it seems  
For believing in dreams for me it's gone.
