Lookin' at the pictures of the places  
That he'd been, an old man told me what he'd found  
Said it don't make no difference whether you're  
Out or whether you're in, though the world keeps  
Goin' round and round. Goin' round and round.  
  
Said he looked at the places talked of the faces that he'd seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down.  
Said it don't make no difference how many places you've been  
Said the world keeps goin' round and round.  
Goin' round and round  
  
Then he put up the pictures shook his head, and with a grin,  
He talked about his ups and downs  
Said it don't make no difference how many fixes you've been in  
No, the world keeps goin' round and round  
Goin' round and round.  
  
Betty Joe Johnson, don't you pull no Daisy Mae on me  
Daisy Mae she did me dirty, so I had to leave her for  
Anna Lee. Anna Lee she had big street feet.  
She spent her nights out on the row  
  
So I started seeing Sally Jackson, I had to let Anna Lee go  
Sally Jackson was a player  
Had another man along with me  
So I just took me one step backwards  
Checked up on old Anna Lee  
Anna Lee still had them street feet  
Liked to dance all night and sleep all day  
So I just took one more step backwards,  
checked up on old Daisy Mae  
Daisy Mae was still doin' dirty,  
so I'll tell you what I had to do  
Had to go just one step further Betty Joe Johnson  
Yeah, and that's how I know you  
  
Looked at the places talked of the faces in life he'd seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down  
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been  
Said the world keeps goin' round and round  
Goin' round and round
