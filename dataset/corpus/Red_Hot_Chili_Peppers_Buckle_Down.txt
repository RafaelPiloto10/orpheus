Hah!  
On the ice  
No holdin'  
My soul  
I want men  
Not mice  
No stoppin'  
My throw  
  
Hah!  
Get this!  
Reds are  
Back bills  
Work  
Or play ball  
Or just turn me loose  
  
I know what's fight, in life, you better buckle down  
Don't give up your fight, in life, you better buckle down  
Two days with might, in life, you better buckle down  
Leave dreams tonight, in life, you better buckle down  
'Cos I know what's right!
