We need a new broom  
To sweep it all clean  
We need a beat boom  
We need a new scheme  
Break all the deadlocks  
And spill all the beer  
Mr Ditko was right  
Mr A so near  
Break out the paints and the brushes  
And spill out your hearts  
No amount of soft soap  
Can ever give you a fresh start  
We are walking on a tight rope  
We can slip beyond religion  
The answer's in your cranium  
And not on independent television
