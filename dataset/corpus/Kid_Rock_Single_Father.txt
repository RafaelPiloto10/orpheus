Latley I've been spendin' lots of time with my kid  
Tellin' him stories  
About the things that we did  
When we were a family  
  
Long time ago  
I've answerd his questions  
'Til I'm blue in the face  
Wish all that hurt in him  
  
I could erase  
But I tell him the truth  
Cause he ain't to young to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Single father  
Part time mother  
When I'm not one  
Then I'm the other  
You used to be  
My full time lover  
Now I'm a single father  
And a part time mother  
I spend every minute  
I can with my boy  
There's no doubt about it  
He's my pride and joy  
  
Someday he will grow up  
And I won't have him no more  
Some things I just find  
Too hard to explain  
  
So we go to mcdonalds  
Or I buy him a train  
And we go put it together  
On the living room floor  
  
Such is the life  
Of a single father  
He says daddy explain  
If it's not too much bother  
  
While its just you and me  
Living here in this home  
I don't understand it  
And neither does he  
  
Why there's just two  
When there should be three of us  
Sharing this moment  
Lord I feel so alone  
  
[Chorus]
