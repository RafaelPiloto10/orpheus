Our man Abu squeezes off twenty tracer rounds  
And that's when she jumps the turnstile  
And as she clings to the roof of the speeding train  
The Double A down to Sheridan Square  
Her cell phone rings  
It's, like, her stupid father  
Be in the door by ten, again  
  
Pixeleen  
Dream deep my three-times perfect ultrateen  
Pixeleen  
Born in the bogs of Jersey  
Trained how to love and spy hard  
Dropped on the streets of Roppongi  
Soaked through on the floor of a noodle shop  
  
And when Abu rams the clip in the mini-Glock  
Up on the catwalk inside the warehouse  
You whip a knife from the top of your go-go boot  
With just a flash of spectacular thigh  
Your pager starts to throb  
It's your as-if boyfriend Randall  
Better keep it real, or whatever  
  
Pixeleen  
Rave on my sleek and soulful cyberqueen  
Pixeleen  
Penned by a hack in the Palisades  
Backed by some guys from Columbia  
Shot all in digital video  
For a million and change  
  
Flashback to cool summer nights  
Freddy can we cut to the chase?  
In the room above your garage  
Everything about me is different  
Symmetrical and clean  
  
This is what I see  
Just a girl in girlie trouble  
Dancing in the video with gun and tambourine  
  
Pixeleen  
Be good my three-times perfect ultrateen  
Pixeleen  
Born on the floor of a noodle shop  
Dropped in the bogs of Jersey  
Shot by a guy from Columbia  
Soaked through all in digital video  
Girl with the sweet backstory  
Pitched in a trailer in Burbank  
Cast by a cool enough yes man  
Screened at a festival in Utah
