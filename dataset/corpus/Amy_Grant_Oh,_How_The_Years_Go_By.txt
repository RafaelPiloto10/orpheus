In our times of trouble  
We only had ourselves  
Nobody else  
No one there to save us  
We had to save ourselves  
  
And when the storms came through  
They found me and you  
Back to back together  
And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine  
Yours and mine forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh how the years go by  
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes the sould never dies  
We fight, we laugh, we cry  
As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down  
But we came around  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now we're back on solid ground, yeah  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring  
In this world of dangers  
'Cause when your heart is strong  
You know you're not alone  
In this world of strangers  
  
[Chorus]  
And if we lose our way  
Any night or day  
Well we'll always be  
Where we should be  
I'm there for you  
And I know you're there for me  
  
[Chorus]
