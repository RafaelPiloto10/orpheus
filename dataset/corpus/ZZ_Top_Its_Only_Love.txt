I'm gonna tell ya what it's all about  
Sweet thang's tryin' to put me out  
She gone and found herself another man  
She tryin' to let me down as fast as she can  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do  
  
Well after runnin' round a time or two  
I found out only the best will do  
Well it's your own fault for lettin' her go  
So maybe now you'll take it slow  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do  
  
Well, it's all over now but the cryin'  
I keep on payin' the price for my lyin'  
Don't let it get you down it ain't nothin' new  
You ain't the only one that it's happened to  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do
