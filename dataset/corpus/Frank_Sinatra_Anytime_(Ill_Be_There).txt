Anytime you need me babe, just call I'll be there  
Call and see what a good friend can be  
When you need someone to care  
Nothing more than understanding, just a man who's undemanding  
  
Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly goes when the wind gently blows  
And I'm asking nothing of you love, only what you want to give  
And I wish you what I wish myself, ss long as I may live  
Other arms will surely hold you, just remember the things that I told you  
  
When these arms of mine enfold you  
It's not out of greed but for love, and for need.  
  
I love you so, I still do, I'm sure you know when I'm holding you  
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye  
Call and I'll come when your world's come undone  
I'm like you, I get lonely too, and I need someone to hold  
Knowing well this world can be hell and sometimes very cold  
  
Nothing firm and nothing binding, now and then a slight reminding  
Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run, somewhere to run  
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone  
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime  
  
There's a certain thing about you, summer, fall and spring about you  
I could write and sing about you, and never run out, never run out (no)  
Never run out of what you're all about  
Oh babe, I'll be there , I'll be there anytime
