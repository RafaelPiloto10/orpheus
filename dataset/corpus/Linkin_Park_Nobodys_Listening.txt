Come, come, come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Peep the style and the kids checking for it  
The number one question is  
How could you ignore it  
We drop right back in the cut  
Over basement tracks  
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that)  
We're just rolling with the rhythm  
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division  
With these non-stop lyrics of life living  
Not to be forgotten  
But still unforgiven  
But in the meantime there are those who want to  
Talk this and that, so I suppose  
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt  
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt  
  
[Chorus]  
Try to give you warning  
But everyone ignores me  
(Told you everything loud and clear)  
But nobody's listening  
Call to you so clearly  
But you don't want to hear me  
(Told you everything loud and clear)  
But nobody's listening  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
And everything's left is a waste of time  
I hate my rhymes  
(But hate everyone else's more)  
I'm riding on the back of this pressure  
Guessing that it's better  
I can't keep myself together  
Because all of this stress  
Gave me something to write on  
The pain gave me something  
I could set my sights on  
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears  
The uphill struggle over the years  
The fear and trash talking  
And the people it was to  
And the people that started it  
Just like you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears  
Nothing to gain, everything to fear  
  
(Scratches)  
Coming at you at every style
