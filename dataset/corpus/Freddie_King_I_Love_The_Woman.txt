I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, she's mean an' she's evil and now my life is in a solid mess  
Yeah...  
She wakes me in the mornin'  
Right before the break of day  
Tellin' me to get up and go out  
I had a earn myself some pay  
How she scolds me like an orphan  
And treats me like a clown  
And when I need some lovin'  
That woman can't be found  
And I love the woman  
And learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, she's mean an' she's evil  
And now my life is in a solid mess!
