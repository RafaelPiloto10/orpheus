It ain't always easy  
Movin' day to day,  
She said she wants to tease me, so I'm on my way.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
She told me she'd be there,  
She phoned me today.  
Little girl, big teaser,  
So I'm on my way.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
My, my, my, my, my, my, my yeah,  
My, my, my, my, my, my, my yeah,  
  
Oo, it ain't always easy,  
Movin' day to day,  
Oh, how the girl loves to tease me,  
So I'm gonna stay.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Nobody home.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
Oh, oh no,  
Ain't got nobody home.
