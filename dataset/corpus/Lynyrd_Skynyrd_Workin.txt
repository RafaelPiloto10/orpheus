Up every mornin' before the sun  
Takin' my lovin' on the run  
Breakin' my back till the day is done  
I'm gonna punch that time clock and have some fun  
Ain't no easy way to get myself out  
  
So-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I gotta buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Oh-workin' just like you-uh  
  
I was raised on the poor side of town  
I made my livin' movin' around  
I never let no one dog me down  
Oh I was taught to stand my ground  
Life was always changin'  
That's just the way it is  
  
So-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I got to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Oh-workin' just like you-uh  
Oh oh oh oh-I keep on workin'  
  
Ooh-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I got to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
  
Oh-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I need to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Oh workin' just like you  
  
Aaah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah  
I keep on workin'-workin'  
I keep on workin'-workin'  
I keep on workin'-workin'  
I keep on workin'-workin'  
Uh oh oh oh
