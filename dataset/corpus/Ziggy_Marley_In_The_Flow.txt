No need to get down no need to get low  
In the flow  
Rastaman that speaketh love is what he preacheth  
In the flow  
Politicans fighting to stop I from lighting  
But in harmony we'll smoke the tree  
In the flow, in the flow  
What they really fighting is inity  
Love for one another equality  
In the flow, in the flow  
Ain't no need to worry  
Ain't no need to hurry  
In the flow  
  
Light up my fire  
What is your desire  
In the flow  
High science that teacheth  
Full moon that preacheth  
Still  
In reality  
Getting high naturally  
In the flow, in the flow  
  
What they really fighting is INITY  
Love for one another EQUALITY
