I think of you now and then  
But I remember when love was new  
And you were mine, my love  
So why would we pretend  
We were lovers and now we're friends  
I don't want to say goodbye to you  
Again, my love  
  
[Chorus]  
It should have been me  
That's lovin' you instead of someone else  
I needed you but how was I to know  
It should have been me  
That's holding you through all the lonely nights  
I knew that I should never let you go,  
My love  
  
What we once had is gone  
No tears, no right, no wrong  
It could never be the same again, my love  
The more we see the less we know  
Now you believe our love will grow  
I don't want to say goodbye to you again,  
My love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My love, how would I survive  
With another broken heart  
On my own again  
When I need a friend  
To help me find a place to start  
  
[Chorus]
