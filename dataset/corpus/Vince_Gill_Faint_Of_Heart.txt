Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Timid and the weak  
Pour me one more on the rocks  
And baby, we'll just see  
  
We'll start a fire, you pour the wine  
Slip on in to these arms of mine  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Ooh, what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh, your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh, what a night this has been  
Baby, let's do it again  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Ooh, what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh, your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh, what a night this has been  
Baby, let's do it again  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me
