Though our paths in life have parted  
You no longer care for me  
But when you're happy with another  
Won't you sometimes think of me  
  
When the evenin' sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Won't you sometimes think of me  
  
I'll always keep your picture  
It means so much to me  
And every night I'll pray, dear  
That you'll sometimes think of me  
  
Think of days that are gone, dear  
Days we could recall  
If you would only try, dear  
But still you blame me for all  
  
When the evenin' sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Won't you sometimes think of me  
  
All I can say's I tried, dear  
But you wouldn't let it be  
So if you're ever sad and lonely  
Won't you sometimes think of me  
  
When the evenin' sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Won't you sometimes think of me
