I fall to pieces  
Each time I see you again  
I fall to pieces  
How can I be just your friend  
  
You want me to act  
Like we've never kissed  
You want me to forget  
Pretend we've never met  
  
And I try and I try  
But I haven't yet  
You walk by  
And I fall to pieces  
  
I fall to pieces  
Each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces  
Time only adds to the blame  
  
You tell me to find someone else to love  
Someone who love me too  
The way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new  
You walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces
