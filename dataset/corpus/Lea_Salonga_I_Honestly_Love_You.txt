Maybe I hang around here  
Little more than I should  
Both know I got somewhere else to go  
But I got something to tell you  
That I never thought I would  
But I believe you really ought to know  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
You don't have to answer  
I see it in your eyes  
Maybe it was better left unsaid  
This is pure and simple  
And you must realize  
That it's coming from my heart and not my head  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
I'm not tryin' to make you feel uncomfortable  
I'm not tryin' to make you anything at all  
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday  
And you shouldn't blow the chance  
When you've got the chance to say  
I love you (i love you)  
I honestly love you  
  
If we both were born in another place and time  
This moment might be ending with a kiss  
There you are with yours  
And here I am with mine  
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
I honestly, love you  
  
I love you
