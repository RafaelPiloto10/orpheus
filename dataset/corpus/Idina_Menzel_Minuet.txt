If we move in together  
Will I still be a slob?  
Will things get ordinary?  
Will I piss you off?  
'Cause I don't cook  
I throw my clothes on the floor  
And I mix the darks and whites  
  
Oh baby, your kisses are pure  
And the sex lasts for hours  
You want me more the less I shower  
I'm a sight for sore eyes  
In your old tighty-whities  
But you love me anyway  
You love me anyway  
  
I thank God for seeing the light  
And not going out with some lawyer-type  
'Cause you're a poet  
A Renaissance man  
A little boy with really strong hands  
  
[Chorus:]  
So many things going through my mind  
Sometimes it gets scary  
But when you're by my side  
The world may be chaotic  
And the skies may explode  
But we'll be okay, baby,  
This much I know  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Is my lullaby  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Is gonna rock me every time  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Will save my life  
  
As I lay upon your chest, baby I'm satisfied  
I'd like to have babies with you  
Like to have maybe two  
Join a carpool and sing the kids to bed  
They can have your colouring and  
My movie rental addiction  
They can be antisocial just like us and  
They can choose their very own religion  
They can climb into bed in the  
Middle of the night and  
Sleep in your arms, as if hypnotized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Alright,  
Everything's gonna be alright  
So if all the things we want  
Are just out of reach  
We move to the mid-West  
And you start to teach  
I'm a woulda, coulda, shoulda  
A one hit wonder  
I'm pretty sure we'll be okay  
'Cause if the skin on your chest  
Still feels that way  
From the sandalwood oil  
That you dab in the middle  
I think just maybe, maybe baby...  
We'd miss it, a little.
