I'd like to sing a story for you  
Here's what I'd sing if I could impress you  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
You've got to be the prettiest girl  
I've ever witnessed in the whole world  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
We both talk about love  
We both know about love  
We both sing the songs  
Can you hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on  
  
I'd like to write a story for you  
With a little melody pretty for you  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Never condescend to humming, my dear  
Always speak the words so lovely to hear  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
We both talk about love  
We both know about love  
We both sing the songs  
Can you hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on  
  
Where did you come from  
Where are you now?  
Just like an angel  
Seems like you left me  
When you broke down  
Down  
Down  
Down  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on
