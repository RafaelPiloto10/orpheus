When shadows fall and stars appears  
A pain I feel I cannot hear  
If I could relive that faithful day  
I would not turn my love away  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
When I think of her tender lips  
Gentle touch of her finger tips  
Reminisce on her eyes so fair  
Moonlight soft on her downy hair  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
If some day I should see her smile  
Hold her hand and me heart beguile  
Feel her warmth in her earnest prayer  
Darling shield me from all despair  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
Now I'm standing alone and sad  
Thinkin' upon the joys I've had  
Time makes fools of men they say  
Take me back to that distant day  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her
