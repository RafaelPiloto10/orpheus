Well, you know I can be found, sitting all alone  
If you can't come around at least please telephone  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
  
Baby, if I made you mad (bop bop bop)  
For something I might have said (bop bop)  
Please forget my past (bop bop bop)  
The future looks bright ahead (bop bop bop bop bop)  
But don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of  
  
Don't stop thinking of me, don't make me feel this way  
Come on over and love me, you know I want you to stay  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
  
Let's walk down to the preacher (bop bop bop)  
Let's say, hey I do (bop bop)  
And then I know you'll want me (bop bop bop)  
And you'll know I want you too (bop bop bop bop bop)  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of  
  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't need no other love, baby  
It's just you I'm thinking of, hey hey hey  
  
Don't stop thinking of me, don't make me feel this way  
Come on over and love me, you know I want you to stay  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
Why should we be apart, baby you know I love you, cross my heart  
  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true [Repeat: x5]  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't want no other love, baby it's just you I'm thinking of
