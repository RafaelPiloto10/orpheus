All my love, all my kissin' you don't know what you been missing  
Oh boy, when you're with me  
Oh boy, all the world would see that you were meant for me  
  
All my life I've been waitin', tonight there will be no hesitatin'  
Oh boy, when you're with me  
Oh boy, all the world would see that you were meant for me  
  
Stars up here and the shadow is fallin'  
You can hear my heart's been callin'  
Little bit lonely every things right  
I'm gonna see my baby tonight
