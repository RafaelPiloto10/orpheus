You've got my number  
You've got my name  
So why don't you call me  
Little Liza Jane  
  
You've got that body  
You've got that frame  
So why don't you call me  
Little Liza Jane  
  
Girl I got it bad for you  
There ain't nothin' I won't do  
Just one kiss and I'll never be the same  
Little Liza Jane, oh little Liza Jane  
  
Now you've heard my story  
You've got to know my name  
So why don't you call me  
Little Liza Jane  
  
Girl I got it bad for you  
There ain't nothin' I won't do  
Just one kiss and I'll never be the same  
Little Liza Jane, oh little Liza Jane
