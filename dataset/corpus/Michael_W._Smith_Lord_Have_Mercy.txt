Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken  
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim  
With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom  
Forgive me for my unbelief  
Renew the fire again  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Lord have mercy  
Christ have mercy  
Lord have mercy on me  
  
I have built an altar where I worship things of god  
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you  
Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing  
Pardon my transgressions  
Help me love you again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I have longed to know you and your tender mercies  
Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end  
I bow my heart before you in the goodness of your presence  
Your grace forever shining  
Like a beacon in the night  
  
[Chorus: x2]
