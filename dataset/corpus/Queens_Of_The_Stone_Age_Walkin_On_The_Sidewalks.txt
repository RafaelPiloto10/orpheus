Got some action on the other side  
Loose teeth in my head  
New programs are coming in  
So rise and take your oath  
I wish we could get away  
Drink wine and screw  
I knew someone else before  
Looked a lot like you  
  
[Chorus]  
And they're gone  
I'm gone  
In space  
  
I been programed as I said before  
Technology  
Just rollin', wheezin' and breathin'  
Eyeballs and teeth  
Words are weightless here on earth because they're free  
You knew someone else before  
Looked a lot like me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
