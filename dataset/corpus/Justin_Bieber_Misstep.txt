I chasing a  
Ilucion this down  
The moon shows me a  
Shortcut to town.  
This is strange, strange I know  
But what else can we do?  
  
Show me all, all around  
Not to trip, I want hear a sound...  
But longer be - be - be bound  
Here we go!  
  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is like a dream  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is very extreme  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
The perfect team  
That you and I are my love!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
  
As in the horror movie to be lame  
I just love these here is the same  
A small and neglect is the end  
No no the end... Yeah!  
Finds it a new way to say now  
Commenters a way to feel now  
This is live, my love, your ball  
Back to losing control.  
  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is like a dream  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is very extreme  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
The perfect team  
That you and I are my love!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
  
A misstep -tep (x8)  
  
Now my love  
Loses control  
And  
Back home  
Here we go!  
Look the sun  
Everything is fun,  
And  
Look the moon  
I wanna know  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
  
You know that love is well  
A misstep - tep  
Wooah!
