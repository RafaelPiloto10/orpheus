Let me wake up in your arms, you say it's not alright  
Let me be so dead and gone, so far away from life  
Close my eyes, hold me tight  
And bury me deep inside your heart  
  
All I ever wanted was you my love  
You're all I ever wanted  
You, my love  
  
Let me never see the sun, never see you smile  
Let us be so dead and so gone  
So far away from life  
Just close my eyes, hold me tight  
And bury me deep inside your heart
