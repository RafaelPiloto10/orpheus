I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"  
I'm so high I can't see you from here  
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me  
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy  
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em  
The weed too loud, turn up the volume  
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow  
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)  
  
God bless the world, and most people in it  
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning  
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning  
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish  
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society  
Now we get high-ya!, call that shit karate  
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy  
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side  
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover  
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover  
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right  
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight  
I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride  
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive  
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive  
Ever today that I took a walk outside  
  
I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal

That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)  
  
Ugh, and we all kiss our mommas  
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't a promise  
Think I'm getting sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal  
And not having money is the root of all evil  
Life is a midget so try to live it up  
It's Doctor Carter bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked  
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up  
I need some wallpaper, before they start the fuss  
Yeah, pick up the phone and call yo block  
Call Mitchell Carmone, now my pockets all bumped  
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough  
Motherfucker I don't shoot you, bitch I shoot ya up  
I ain't ride with these niggas, I don't like these niggas  
I just roll another joint, white spike with these niggas  
When I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes  
And then I took a walk outside  
  
And I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got

That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)  
  
C-Bo  
Stop playin'  
Run up in your fucking mouth nig'!  
I'm beside myself so that makes two of me,  
Nigga!
