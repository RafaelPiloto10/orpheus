And I don't want you and I don't need you  
Don't bother to resist or I'll beat you  
It's not your fault that you're always wrong  
The weak ones are there to justify the strong  
The beautiful people, the beautiful people  
The beautiful people, the beautiful people  
The worms will live in every host  
It's hard to pick which one they eat the most  
The horrible people, the horrible people  
It's as anatomic as the size of your steeple  
Capitalism has made it this way  
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away  
There's no time to discriminate  
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way, break it away  
Hey you, what do you see?  
Something beautiful, something free  
Hey you, are you trying to be mean?  
You live with apes man, it's hard to be clean  
The beautiful people, the beautiful people  
The beautiful people, the beautiful people  
And I don't want you and I don't need you  
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you  
It's not your fault that you're always wrong  
The weak ones are there to justify the strong  
Hey you, what do you see?  
Something beautiful, something free  
Hey you, are you trying to be mean?  
You live with apes man, it's hard to be clean  
Hey you, what do you see?  
Something beautiful, something free  
Hey you, are you trying to be mean?  
You live with apes man, it's hard to be clean
