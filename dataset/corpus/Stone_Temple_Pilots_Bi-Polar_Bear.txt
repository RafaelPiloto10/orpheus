So I'm letting it go again  
I'm halfway full on  
Left my meds on the sink today  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
So I'm holding her hand again  
My palm sweats  
Hold on  
Think I've had too much coffee  
I'm manic as hell  
But I'm goin' strong  
Left my meds on the sink again  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
Don't sleep behind the wheel at the stoplight  
Can't sleep behind the wheel as you're drivin' home  
  
You keep comin' down the hill as you're fallin'  
You keep fallin' from the hill as you're comin' down
