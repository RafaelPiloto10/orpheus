I don't care, alone you go  
I don't care, alone you stay  
But good kind of treatment  
I'm bringing you home someday  
Well, someday, baby  
You ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
Now you keep on bendin'  
If the dice don't pay  
Can't you see, little girl  
You're living too fast?  
But someday, baby  
You ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
Are you tellin' everybody  
In the neighborhood  
'Cause you don't love me, baby  
You didn't mean me no good  
Yes, but someday, baby  
You ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
Alright!
