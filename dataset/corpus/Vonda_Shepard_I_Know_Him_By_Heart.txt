There's a secret path I follow  
To a place no one can find  
Where I meet my perfect someone  
I've kept hidden in my mind  
  
Where my heart makes my decisions  
Til my dream becomes a vision  
And the love I feel  
Makes him real someday  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
  
Am I living an illusion?  
Wanting something I can't see  
If I compromise, I'd be living lies  
Pretending love's not meant to be  
  
Cause I know my heart's worth saving  
And I know that he'll be waiting  
So I'll hold on  
I'll stay strong til then  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart
