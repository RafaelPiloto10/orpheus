Grand canyons of space and time universal  
My mind is subjected to all  
  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin  
  
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal  
I face the impregnable wall  
  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin  
  
Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending  
Until I give out my last breath  
  
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
