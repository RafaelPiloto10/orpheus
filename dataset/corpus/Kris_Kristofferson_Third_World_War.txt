Where the young men's brave new visions threaten old men's selfish  
Dreams  
And they try to crush the spirit with their money and machines  
And they call it communism because they don't know what it means  
In the third world war  
  
And the rich keep getting richer and as wrong as they are right  
And the poor become the victims of the armies of the night  
And the odds are never even and their skins are never white  
In the third world war  
  
Broken rules and dirty warriors spreading lies and secret funds  
Can't defeat the campesino with their money and their guns  
'cause he's fighting for his future and his freedom and his sons  
In the third world war
