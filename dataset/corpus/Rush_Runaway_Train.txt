Nothing blooms  
In a loveless room  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
Who's the fool  
Where apathy rules?  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If there's no defiance  
It remains insane  
If it's all compliance  
It's a runaway train  
  
Nothing so cruel  
When malevolence rules  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
There is no defence  
Against pointed arrogance  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
It can be surprising  
When you lose the shame  
And the sun starts rising  
Another day to tame  
  
If your heart is aching  
Just remove the shame  
You've got to want it  
  
Give your soul a shaking  
And refuse the blame  
You've got to want it  
  
Who's the fool  
Where apathy rules?  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If there's no defiance  
It remains insane  
If it's all compliance  
It's a runaway train
