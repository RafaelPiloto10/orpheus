Your cheatin' heart will make you weep,  
You'll cry and cry, and try to sleep.  
But sleep won't come, the whole night through.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.  
  
When tears come down like falling rain,  
You'll toss around, and call my name.  
You'll walk the floor, the way I do.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.  
  
When tears come down like falling rain,  
You'll toss around, and call my name.  
You'll walk the floor, the way I do.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.
