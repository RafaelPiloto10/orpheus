There's a picture on my kitchen wall  
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved  
There's a party getting started in the yard  
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive  
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?  
  
By the pool last night, apparently  
The chemicals weren't mixed properly  
You hit your head and then forgot your name  
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  
And now your altitude and memory's a shame  
  
[Chorus]  
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up  
With a little bit more of innocence  
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young  
It's OK to be easily ignored  
I like to believe it was all about love for a child  
  
And when the house was left in shambles  
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  
Well I'm far too old to care about that now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce  
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes  
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age  
and they never check to see my grades  
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was all about love...
