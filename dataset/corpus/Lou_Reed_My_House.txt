The image of the poet's in the breeze  
Canadian geese are flying above the trees  
A mist is hanging gently on the lake  
My house is very beautiful at night  
  
My friend and teacher occupies a spare room  
He's dead - at peace at last the Wandering Jew  
Other friends has put stones on his grave  
He was the first great man that I had ever met  
  
Sylvia and I got out our Ouija Board  
To dial a spirit - across the room it soared  
We were happy and amazes at what we saw  
Blazing stood the proud and regal name Delmore  
  
Delmore, I missed all your funny ways  
I missed your jokes and the brilliant things you said  
My Dedalus to your Bloom  
Was such a perfect wit  
And to find you in my house  
Makes things perfect  
  
I really got a lucky life  
My writhing, my motorcycle and my wife  
And to top it all off a spirit of pure poetry  
Is living in this stone and wood house with me  
  
The image of the poet's in the breeze  
Canadian geese are flying above the trees  
A mist is hanging gently on the lake  
Our house is very beautiful at night  
  
Our house is very beautiful at night  
Our house is very beautiful at night  
Our house is very beautiful at night
