I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
And I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
'Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children  
Laughter fills the air  
  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
  
Oh I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas  
Is you, baby  
  
It's all I want for Christmas  
It's all I want for Christmas  
It's all I want for babe,  
All I want, all I really want is you baby  
All I want, all I really want is, want is, want is, want is  
Ooh baby
