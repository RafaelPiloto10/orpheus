I was walking along, minding my business  
When out of an orange-colored sky  
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!  
Wonderful you came by  
  
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine  
When out of that orange-colored view  
Wham! Bam! Alakazam!  
I got a look at you  
  
One look and I yelled "Timber"  
"Watch out for flying glass"  
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout,  
"I've been hit, This is it, This is it!"  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!  
Out of an orange-colored sky.
