I'm feeling low, I tear out my hair  
Walking 'round in circles like I don't care  
One shoe off, the other one on  
Cause I threw the damn shoe the night that you were gone  
I'm in the mood, I'm in such a mess  
My heart is broken and I'm in distress  
Don't want to eat, don't want to sleep  
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout the dirty way you treated me  
I'm in no mood for company  
You see I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you yeah  
  
Looking down at the way I get dressed  
I need to know is that why you left  
My face is sweet but my head is wrecked  
By the things that you said on the night you left  
You can keep your sympathy  
Because I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I can live without you, I'm telling you girl now  
I can live without you, can you hear me  
  
You know you can keep your sympathy  
Because I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby  
  
I call your name (I call your name) to drive you insane (to drive me insane)  
'Cause I feel the need ('cause I feel the need) to make my heart bleed (to
make my heart bleed)  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby
