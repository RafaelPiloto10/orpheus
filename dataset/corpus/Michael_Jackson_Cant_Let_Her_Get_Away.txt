I thought she had to have it  
Since the first time she came  
Who knows the situation  
Mysteries do remain  
And now I wonder why  
I breakdown when I cry  
Is it something I said  
Or is it just a lie  
(is it just a lie)  
  
I try so hard to love you  
Some things take  
Time and shame  
I think the whole world  
Of you  
Your thoughts of me remain  
I'll play the fool for you  
I'll change the rules for you  
Just say it and I'll do  
Just make this thing come true  
(make a dream come true)  
  
If I let her get away  
Though I'm begging  
On my knees  
I'll be crying everyday  
Knowing the girl  
That got away  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
  
I tried to mastermind it  
By saying let it be  
But every time I did it  
The hurt came back at me  
I told you that I need you  
A thousand times and why  
I played the fool for you  
And still you said goodbye  
(still you said goodbye)  
  
If I let her get away  
Then the world will  
Have to see  
A fool who lives alone  
And the fool who  
Set you free  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I've got the feelin'  
  
Can't let go  
Can't let go  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away
