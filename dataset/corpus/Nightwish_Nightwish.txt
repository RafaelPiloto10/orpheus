Oh, setting Sun,  
Thy red rays maketh me cry.  
They remind me of the one  
Whose love awaits me in the sky.  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both  
After the landscape of death I cross.  
Before my sorrows I must die,  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.  
  
The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,  
Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.  
Beneath my dreams and wishes  
I long for thy caresses.  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both,  
After the landscape of death I cross.  
Before my sorrows I must die,  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.  
  
"Passed away in silence  
The flute from the realm unseen  
Empties it's heart  
Making love to me  
With it's enchanting melody.  
Light of Orion,  
Shadow of Andromeda,  
Call of the dancing Universe.  
Their love I must enter  
Before thou can blame my soul  
That is peace"
