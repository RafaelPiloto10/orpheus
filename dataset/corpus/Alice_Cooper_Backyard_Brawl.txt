Got a cut on my thigh, got a nail in my eye  
And I'm bleedin' all over the wall  
Got a barbed wire bat and a dude on the mat  
Ain't getting up soon at all  
  
Got a head full of rage and a belly full of hate  
I'm the neighbourhood legend that just can't wait  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Don't matter who you are, don't matter what colour  
Brown or white'll do  
But if you're yellow you'll be covered in red  
A whole lotta black and blue  
  
Jump off the trailer in a pile full o' guys  
Scratching and kicking and pulverised  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Only got six teeth but three of those  
Are sharp enough to bite off your nose  
  
At the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl  
  
[Dialogue]  
You think you're so [beep] tough  
You talkin' to me?  
You're mine  
Come on, lets go  
Come on stitches..
