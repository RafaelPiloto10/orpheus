Life is a hustle, every day struggle  
Pushing your way at the top  
Gotta keep it on track and never look back  
And no, you don't dare stop.  
  
There's someone behind you keeping an eye on you  
Hoping you take a fall, a lady, she's liked to see me more  
But I can't slow down at all.  
  
She says:  
Wow, I need some time alone  
I say: no, we gotta keep pushing on  
She said: life is good, love is better?  
  
My daddy, he always preached to me  
You gotta reach for the sky  
Make rain while the sun is shining  
Boy, don't let it pass you by  
  
Money and power is in your hand  
You can do what you wanna be  
Oh, my baby, she?s got a different philosophy.  
  
She says:  
Now I know my sweet lady must be heaven sent  
I just cover the meaning of what she meant  
I've been working so hard for the good life but I headed all the while  
I've found my hiding treasure, baby, right there in this smile.  
  
I say:  
Wow, seems we've spent time alone  
  
I say:  
Wow, how our love has grown  
She was right all alone  
  
I say:  
Life is good, love is better?
