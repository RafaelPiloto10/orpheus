I felt it.  
The wire touched my neck and  
Then someone pulled it tighter  
I never saw it coming  
I started to black out and  
Then someone said good morning  
I took it as a warning  
I should have seen it coming  
So now I'll take a chance on  
This thing we may have started  
Intentional or not I  
Don't think we saw it coming  
It's all adding up to something  
That as of some involvement  
That as for our commitment  
I think I see it coming  
If we step out of that limb  
  
My heart beat, beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot so I say why not  
If I say forget it I no that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if we don't take they're be no chance  
But you're the best I got  
So take the long shot  
  
I realize that there is all this starting  
That we're both scared about but  
We'll never see them coming  
Throw caution to the wind and  
We'll see which way it's blowing  
And to this pulling on  
We'll never see it coming  
Until it's much to close to stop  
  
My heart beat, beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability  
And all probability  
  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it  
I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance  
'Cause I'm the best you got  
So take the long shot  
  
What a pleasant surprise what a breath of fresh air  
You knock the wind out of me  
Blindsided and so unaware  
  
Ahaa, ahaa, ahaa,  
  
Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction  
And you fit my description  
I never saw you coming  
But we'll make it even though  
  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it  
I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take the long shot  
  
You didn't expect this  
Oh you never saw me coming  
You didn't expect this  
Oh you never saw this coming  
  
I take the long shot  
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot  
'Cause you're the best I got  
  
Oh I'm take this chance on you baby  
I'm take this chance on you baby  
I'm taking this chance
