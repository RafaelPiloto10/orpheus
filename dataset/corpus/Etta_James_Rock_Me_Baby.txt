I want you to rock me, baby  
  
Rock me, baby, rock me all night long  
I want you to rock me, baby, rock me all night long

I said roll me, baby now, roll me till you make me feel  
And I want you to do this for me, baby

I said roll, roll me, baby now, roll me like you roll a big old wheel  
'Cause I know that you know, baby, you know how to make me feel  
  
Roll me slow, roll me all night long  
I said roll me, roll me slow, baby, roll me all night long

I know that you know how to make me feel  
  
I said rock me, baby, now rock me all night long  
Say, baby you rock me, baby, rock me all night long  
I said rock me, baby, like

Roll me, baby now, roll me like you roll a big old wheel  
Roll me, baby now, roll me, roll me like you roll a big old wheel  
I said I know that you know, you know how to make me feel
