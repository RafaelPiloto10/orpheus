And along came something sacred  
I never knew what I found  
The demons dance around, elated  
They're hurting me  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Falling awake in a nightmare  
Images of horror abound  
Thought I stumbled upon salvation  
Hell I found  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Well, I'll never be the same  
It's the greatest lie ever told  
No, I'll never be the same  
I sold my soul  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown
