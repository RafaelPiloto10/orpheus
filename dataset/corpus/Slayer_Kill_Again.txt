Lurking in the dismal fog  
Hungry for your blood  
Seeking harmless victims  
Satisfy my needs  
  
Schizophrenic lunatic  
Uncontrolled desire  
Rape and ravage lady fair  
Pledged to die  
  
[Chorus]  
No apparent motive  
Just kill and kill again  
Survive my brutal thrashing  
I'll hunt you till the end  
My life's a constant battle  
The rage of many men  
Homicidal maniac  
  
Trapped in mortal solitude  
Lift the gleaming blade  
Slice her flesh to shreds  
Watch the blood flow free  
  
Hatred growing stronger  
None survive my wrath  
Suffer from the throbbing pain  
Yield your life to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kill the preacher's only son  
Watch the infant die  
Bodily dismemberment  
Drink the purest blood  
Unrelenting need to kill  
Death upon you now  
Anxiously awaiting  
Next in line.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Kill again)
