Sometimes you think you'll be fine by yourself  
'Cause a dream is a wish you make all alone  
It's easy to feel like you don't need help  
But it's harder to walk on your own  
  
You'll change  
Inside  
When you  
Realize  
  
The world comes to life  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
The gift of a friend  
  
Someone who knows when your lost and your scared  
There through the highs and the lows  
Someone you can count on, someone who cares  
Besides you where ever you go  
  
You'll change inside  
When you  
Realize  
The world comes to life  
  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
By your side  
  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
  
And when your hope crashes down  
Shattering to the ground  
You'll, you'll feel all alone  
When you don't know which way to go  
And there's no signs leading you home  
You're not alone  
  
The world comes to life  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
When you believe in  
You can believe in
