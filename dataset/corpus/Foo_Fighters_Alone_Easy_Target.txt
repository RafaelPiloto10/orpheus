They knew all along  
They're not dumb, they were so wrong  
She's not always fun  
Hate it now, call when I'm done  
  
Pieces fell in place  
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face  
Turn and swing the pace  
I'll give this, keep the good waist  
  
Head is on  
I want out  
I'm alone and I'm an easy target  
Metronome  
I want out  
I'm alone and I'm an easy target  
  
Crazy TV dreams might be true  
Not what it seems.  
Food and cavities, chewing words  
Tear at the seams  
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad  
Not that he should  
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad  
Not that I should  
  
Did you ever listen?  
Get out
