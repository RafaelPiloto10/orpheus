Oh mother, say a prayer for me  
Jesse's back in town, it won't be easy  
Don't let him near me  
Don't let him touch me  
Don't let him please me  
  
(chorus)  
Jesse, I won't cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I won't make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I won't change the sheets for you  
I won't put on cologne  
I won't sit by the phone for you  
  
Annie, keep reminding me  
That he cut out my heart like a paper doll  
Sally, tell me once again  
How he set me up just to see me fall  
  
Chorus  
  
Jesse, quick come here  
I won't tell a soul  
Not even myself  
Jesse, that you've come back to me  
My friends will all say "She's gone again'  
But how can anyone know what you are to me  
That I'm in heave again because you've come back to me - Oh Jessie!  
  
Jesse, I'll always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I'll always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I can easily change my mind about you  
And put on cologne  
And sit by the phone for you  
  
Jesse, let's open the wine  
And drink to the heart  
Which has a will of it's own  
My friends, let's comfort them  
They're feeling bad  
They think I've sunk so low  
  
Jesse, I'll always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I'll always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I will change the sheets for you  
Put on cologne  
And I will wait by the phone for you - Oh Jesse
