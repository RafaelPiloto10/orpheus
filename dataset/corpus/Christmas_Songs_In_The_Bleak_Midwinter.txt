In the bleak midwinter  
Frost wind made moan  
Earth stood  
Hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen  
Snow on snow  
Snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long ago  
  
Our god  
Heaven cannot hold him  
Nor earth sustain  
Heaven and Earth  
Shall flee away  
When he comes to reign  
In the bleak midwinter  
A stable place sufficed  
The lord God almighty  
Jesus Christ  
  
Angels and archangels  
May have gathered there  
Cherubim and seraphim  
Thronged the air  
But his mother only  
In her maiden bliss  
Worshiped the beloved  
With a kiss  
  
What can I give him  
Poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet  
What I can I give him  
Give my heart
