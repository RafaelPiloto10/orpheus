Well they took a little honey from a honey tree  
They dressed it up and they called at me  
Now everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now  
Well half past nine and half past four  
Fifty women knocking on my door  
And everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now  
I went out last night, I didn't stay late  
'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates  
And everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now  
Me and my girl, sittin' in the shade  
Talking about the money that she has made  
And everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now  
Get down  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby  
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
