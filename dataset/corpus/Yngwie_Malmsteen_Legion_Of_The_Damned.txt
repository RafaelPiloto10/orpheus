Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
  
Deprived of our lives, pushed into war  
Our fearless leader lies,  
he's rotten to the core  
As per instruction  
march through no man's land  
Machines of destruction,  
combat hand to hand  
  
Marching over frozen water,  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we don't know  
We're strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
We're the Legion of the Damned  
  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Soldier without faith, fight fire with fire  
  
Don't know why we hate, so we'll die trying  
This is madness without end,  
are we men or fools  
There's no honor to defend,  
we obey insane rules  
  
Mortars blowing us to pieces,  
hell is breaking loose  
Minds all sick full of diseased,  
no one sees the truth  
Marching over frozen water,  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we don't know  
We're strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
We're the Legion of the Damned  
  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
  
When it's said and done, there'll be no victory  
They're blocking out the sun,  
all that's left is misery  
  
Marching over frozen water,  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we don't know  
We're strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
We're the Legion of the Damned  
Battling the enemy that we don't know  
We're strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
We're the Legion of the Damned  
  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned.
