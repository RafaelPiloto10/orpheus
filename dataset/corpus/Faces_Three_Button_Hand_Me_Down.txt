I don't need no one's opinion  
On the matter concerning my dress  
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma  
There were many things I did not possess  
I never complained because my father said  
"son, you'll get your chance before you're my age."  
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit  
Written all over his face  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down  
  
I had my fair share of neat women  
But they came between me and my suit  
That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston  
Not forgetting the one in Detroit  
They said, "we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet  
But can't you lose your suit?"  
I said, "no, you can't do that to me."  
I remember what my father said  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down, ha, ha  
Three button hand me down  
  
I've never been a tidy dresser  
And the fold in my trousers - it ain't straight  
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one  
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit  
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor  
And get myself a smooth outfit  
Then I remember what my father said to me  
I'll make you from the open road  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you go."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down
