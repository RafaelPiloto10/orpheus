Words and music by bob seger  
  
Went out in norfork hung on a short short  
  
Livin' with a bottle of wine  
  
To music, ladies and burned out babies  
  
I was tryin' to write a couple of lines  
  
Sherriff gribbs with his grim ad libs  
  
Spoutin' 'bout the crime in the streets  
  
And women were screamin' and some were dreamin'  
  
'bout the crowd between the sheets  
  
You know that music died, hurt my pride  
  
Somehow I got through, back in '72  
  
Somehow we made it to baton rouge  
  
We stayed inside for a week  
  
We weren't in town for no mardi gras  
  
So we decided to sleep  
  
Houston, yes, was a good old guest  
  
Tho knows how bad we wanted to play  
  
But we got homesick for lincoln park  
  
(imagine that) and then we just couldn't stay  
  
Tricky dick, he played it slick  
  
Something I was afraid he'd do  
  
Back in '72, oh, '72  
  
Then all our new born philosophers  
  
Out went to alert the world  
  
Then some psuedo-intellectuals  
  
Even got it unfurled  
  
Takin' notes on that harvard course  
  
And got me on a bottle of seed  
  
It was so hip to be negative  
  
So square to try and leave  
  
When the waters cleared, it was what we feared  
  
We learned nothin' new,  
  
Back in '72  
  
'72  
  
'72  
  
In '72  
  
Back in '72  
  
Back in '72 back in '72,...
