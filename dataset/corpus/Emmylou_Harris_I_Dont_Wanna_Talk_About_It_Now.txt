God knows how I love you  
Like a user needs a drug  
And I'll never be free of ya  
You are poison in my blood  
I tried to swim that river  
And get to higher ground  
I been three times under  
The next one'll see me drown  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
God knows why you don't want me  
No one would do the things I do  
But to my grave it's gonna haunt me  
How I got down on my knees for you  
You are my obsession  
And the reason that I live  
You alreday got my soul  
There's nothin left to give  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
The devil is deep water baby  
And I'm in way over my head  
But I'd be drawn and quartered  
If I could keep you in my bed  
I can't break this spell  
I know the trouble that I'm in  
But If I got out of the mouth of hell  
I'd walk right back again  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down
