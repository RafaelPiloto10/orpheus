When it's missing then you want it more  
It isn't right  
Turning, turning out the door  
And back to this  
Leave it like it was before  
And let me out  
Must've been the end of the story  
  
Giving it all, giving it all away  
You're gonna wake up someone  
Well study it all  
The wings, the crowd, your face  
You're gonna end up like one  
  
Well, trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
"The road don't like me"  
Travel away  
Travel it all away  
"The road's gonna end on me"  
  
Man, they like me  
Cause I'm a warrior, a warrior  
Stand on my feet  
Dance the warrior, the warrior  
Where would I be?  
I'd be a warrior, a warrior  
  
Now the strangers have caught on  
And they're riding in the backseat  
The river's gonna wash all  
Yeah the river it spoke to me  
It told me I'm small  
And I swallowed it down  
If I make it all  
I'm a make you want me  
  
Hey!  
  
Trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
"The road don't like me"  
Travel it all, travel it all away  
"The road's gonna get on me"  
And I'm small  
The road's gonna get on me  
Well if it gets it all  
The road's gonna end on me  
  
Hey!  
Hey, hey!  
  
Like a warrior, a warrior  
Dance the warrior, the warrior
