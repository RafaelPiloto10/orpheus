Yes I'm in love, who looks at you, the way, I do.  
When you smile, I can tell, we know each other,  
very well. How can, I show you, I'm glad, I got to  
know you. 'Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think  
I'm fine. Yes I'm in love, and what, I'd do, to make you  
mine. Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be, the last  
to know.  
  
[Chorus]  
My hands are shaking, don't let, my heart keep breaking,  
'cause I need your love, I want your love. Say your in love,  
in love, with this guy, if not I'll just die.  
  
Do Do Do Do Do Do  
Do Do Do Do  
  
Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be, the last  
to know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If not I'll just die.  
  
Do Do Do Do  
Do Do Do Do Do  
Do Do Do Do
