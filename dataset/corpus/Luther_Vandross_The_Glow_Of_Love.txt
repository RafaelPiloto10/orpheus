Flower's bloomin', mornin' dew and the beauty seems to say  
"It's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true and gay"  
Easy livin' and we're givin' what we know we're dreamin' of  
We are one, havin' fun walkin' in the glow of love  
We're walkin', ooh  
  
Smilin' faces, goin' places, it's a wonder, it's so clear  
By a fountain, climbin' mountains, as we'll hold each other near  
Sippin' wine, we try to find that special magic from above  
As we share our affair talkin' in the glow of love  
Yeah, yeah, in the glow of love, ooh  
  
Here in glow of love  
(You're a shinin' star)  
Here in glow of love  
(No matter who you are)  
Here in glow of love, here in glow of love  
(So I want to let you know you move me, yeah, yeah)  
  
There is no better way to be  
(Hold me, caress me)  
I'm yours forever and a day, hey  
(We are a sweet bouquet, oh yeah)  
Seasons for happiness are here  
(Happy we're so happy)  
Reason we're filled with cheer is  
We'll imagine in the glow of love, yeah  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
In the glow of love yeah, ohh yeah come on  
  
Never lonely with you only time will always be our friend  
Reaching far to find a star, our destiny is Heaven sent  
Making on this lovin' tone, we'll never part, the two of us  
We'll always reminisce kissin' in the glow of love  
In the glow of love, we wanna be  
  
Here in glow of love  
(Gotta let you know you movin' me, yeah)  
Here in glow of love  
(You really, really do, yeah)  
Here in glow of love  
(I gotta let you know you movin' me, yeah)  
Here in glow of love  
(Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, ohh yeah yeah yeah)  
  
There is no better way to be  
(Honey, I love you)  
I'm yours forever and a day, hey  
(We are a sweet bouquet, oh yeah)  
Seasons for happiness are here  
(Happy we're so happy, yeah)  
Reason we're filled with cheer is  
We'll imagine in the glow of love
