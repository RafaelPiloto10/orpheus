If angels are messengers from God  
I wrote a letter he should read  
Been living on Faithless Street  
All by myself  
Work your whole life for someone else  
Trying to find sanction  
Christ above man  
He never shed his peace on this land  
So I started this damn country band  
Been living on Faithless Street  
All by myself

Trying to find sanction  
Christ above man  
He never shed his peace on this land  
So I started this damn country band  
Cause punk rock was too hard to sing
