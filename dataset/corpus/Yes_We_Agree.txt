Answers never clear again  
This turning of the page  
This turning look away  
  
There I took a left turn  
Before I came of age  
I agreed to let it out  
I agreed to let it go  
I agreed to turn around  
I agreed to turn my face away  
  
Danger is the most important  
Fear you'll ever know  
The transporting of refugees  
The silent night is cold  
  
And all the time  
We looked around  
As we were never told  
  
But we agreed to let it out  
We agreed to let it go  
We agreed to turn our backs  
We agreed to turn our face away, away  
  
Thousands to the million  
Sisters, grandmothers and more  
It's not the feast we throw away  
It's the way we close the door  
  
Their silence deafens every sound  
We try just to ignore  
To waste their future freedom  
We'll regret forever more  
  
I believe in  
I believe in  
These are the days that we will talk about  
I believe in  
I believe in  
One understanding what is real  
  
If we are one  
Then we are refugees  
We are the prisoners of our own design  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song  
Perpetuate this song of love  
  
Now we build the bridges  
That we walk upon together  
At the last count many lonely souls  
The sadness always kills  
  
Each breaking point is waiting  
For the promise to fulfill  
  
When we agree to turn the page  
When we agree to help them free  
When we agree to let it out  
When we agree to let it shine  
When we agree to let it run  
When we agree to let it change our lives  
  
I believe in, our lives  
I believe in, our lives  
These are the days we will talk about  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
Song of love  
  
Yeah, yeah, perpetuate this song of love  
  
Seeing through the eyes of child  
Seeing through the eyes of child
