While all is still in the night  
And silence starts its flow  
Become or disbelieve me  
Left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you  
  
While waiting on the Light  
How patience learned to grow  
Endeavor could relieve me  
Left alone with my heart  
I know that I can love you  
  
Love you like you may have never been  
Move you more ways than you have seen  
To a point in the time where we see so much more  
Than the ground that we touch  
With each step so unsure  
  
As teardrops cloud the sight  
Your eyes may never know  
No truth could ever fear me  
And left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you.  
  
Love you like you may have never seen  
Move you more ways than you have been  
To a point in the time where we see so much more  
Than the ground that we touch  
With each step so unsure  
  
As teardrops cloud the sight  
Your eyes may never know  
No truth could ever fear me  
And left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you.
