Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Down every road I travel  
Lord, to you might look the same  
But maybe you might tell me  
Every town's got a different name  
I'd like to find a woman  
That won't hell-bent to tie me down  
Someone to be content  
To go anywhere I'm bound  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone
