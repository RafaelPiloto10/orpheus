Every night seems, dinner and wine  
Saturdays, girls  
I was never in love, never had the time  
In my hustle and hurried world  
Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely  
I need someone to hold me, oh  
  
It's such a crazy home town  
It can drag you down  
Till you run out of dreams  
So you party all night to the music and lights  
But you don't what happiness means  
I was dancing in the dark with strangers  
No love around me  
When suddenly you found me, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl  
  
Everything good, everything fine  
That's what you are  
So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb  
As high as the highest star  
I'm living the life time in every minute  
That we're together  
And I'm staying right here forever, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl
