I hate waking up it means that I have to die again tonight  
35 years old and I'm still sleeping outside  
Yeah I think I know your face I don't want to to know your name  
I won't give in I'm not like that  
I won't give in  
  
You say it's Christmas Eve that don't mean nothing to me  
Just another fucked up day just another waste of time  
You wonder why I live like this man you just won't understand  
I won't give in I'm not like that  
Yeah, I won't give in  
  
You smart ass college fuck  
Act like you think you're tough  
I was just like you  
More pride than you could know  
Think you pity me  
  
I'll kick your ass if you pity me  
I won't give in I'm not like that  
No, I won't give in to you  
Just go away  
  
You college boy act like you think you're tall  
I won't give in I'm not like that  
No, I won't give in
