The whiteness of confusion  
Is unfolding from my mind  
I stare around in wonder  
Have I left my life behind?  
  
I catch the scent of ambergris  
And turn my head, surprised  
My gaze is caught and held and I  
Am helpless, mesmerized  
  
Panacea, liquid grace  
Oh let me touch your fragile face  
Enchantment falls around me  
And I know I cannot leave  
Here's a meaning for my life  
  
A shelter from the storm  
Pacify my troubles with  
Her body, soft and warm  
Naked in our unity  
A smile for every tear  
  
Gentle hands that promise me  
Comfort through the years  
Yet I know I must be gone  
Before the light of dawn  
  
Panacea, passion pure  
I can't resist your gentle lure  
My heart will lie beside you  
And my wandering body grieves
