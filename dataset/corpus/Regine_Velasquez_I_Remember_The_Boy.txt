Today I heard them play the song again  
An old familiar strain from way back when  
Every note and every line  
It's always been a favorite song of mine  
  
It used to haunt me so some years ago  
Reminds me of the boy I used to know  
And although the melody lives on  
The memories and the boy are all but gone  
  
And while the song still brings that certain glow  
And the world still sings of love I know  
It isn't quite the way it was before  
I remember the boy  
But I don't remember the feeling anymore  
  
The promises we've made seemed easier then  
As if we knew our love would never end  
But sesond change and time erases the tears  
As swiftly as the ripples disappear  
  
So while the song still brings that certain glow  
And the world still sings of love I know  
It isn't quite the way it was before  
I remember the boy  
But I don't remember the feeling anymore  
  
I remember the boy  
But I don't remember the feeling... Anymore
