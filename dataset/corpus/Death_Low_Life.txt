Those who are a waste of life  
Use up air that others could breathe  
Human leaches all around  
Looking superion is what they believe  
  
Fake is the word you represent  
Your existence on earth I resent  
At the cost of others you get by  
Each word that you speak is a lie  
  
Low life  
That's all you'll ever be  
Lies in effect  
That's what you like to see  
  
Hiding behind material values  
That help cover up your weakness  
Never to change, always to look  
For an easy way out of life  
  
A pathetic excuse for a human being  
  
Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought  
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not  
  
Fake is the word you represent  
Your existence on earthj I resent  
At the cost of others you get by  
Each word that you speak is a lie  
  
Low life  
That's all you'll ever be  
Lies in effect  
That's what you like to see
