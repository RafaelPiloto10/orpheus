Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's a party tonight down in...  
Yeah and I'm goin' if you need a ride  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
  
Well baby the dreamers....  
They ride down the streets with death in their eyes  
And the new world's defeat, baby, it eats your eyes  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
I said come on, come on, let's go tonight  
  
Well a man...  
And he lost his wife  
He walks down the streets babe, with death in his eyes  
Well everybody wants heaven  
But nobody wants to die  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
Baby, come on, come on, let's go tonight  
I said come on, come on, let's go tonight
