I'm awfully tired of the same old business  
Kiss the babies, make 'em cry  
I'm only lookin' for one good woman  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Stick a needle in my eye, eye, eye  
Got a load of mashed potatoes  
Holdin' gravy like a fishin' hole  
I know something that might sound funny  
I got no money and my buddy's broke  
I got no money and my buddy's broke  
Counterculture, mother vulture  
Post Toasties and a quart of beer  
I'm only looking for a place to go to  
Somebody ask me what I'm doin' here?  
Somebody ask me what I'm doin' here?  
A boneless breast and a crispy thigh  
Sittin' at the bar n' giving me the eye  
Black crows on a garbage can  
What kind of fella do you think I am?  
Stick a needle in my eye, eye, eye  
I'm fallin' in with bad companions  
My mind is weak and my throat is dry  
Thanksgiving in the Grand Canyon  
Can't keep my fingers off that country pie  
I'm awfully tired of the same old business  
Kiss the babies, make 'em cry  
I'm only lookin' for one good woman  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Stick a needle in my eye, eye, eye  
Stick a needle in my eye, eye, eye
