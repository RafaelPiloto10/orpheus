[Verse:]  
I was an idiot in Utero, somehow miss New Mexico  
Fell to earth in Baltimore, I know  
Now they lay case in empty rooms, birthday cards and red balloons  
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O  
Empty parties filled with people I don't know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Tellin' lies and taking shots, gettin' laid in parking lots  
Gettin' high and gettin' caught, I know  
All my broken paper planes, parachutes and window panes  
I'm a shooting star gone novocaine, I know  
So I write to all the girly magazines  
Splash my passion on the pages in-between  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Rising from the afterglow, a dodo bird with polio  
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I play with a rock and roll band on a subway  
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays  
We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away, I know  
Come on wake up the congregation, we will see the light tonight  
The spark the flash the bang the bite  
I know, I know, I know know know know know know know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
If they dropped a bomb on London, swallow la with the sea  
Dislocation, dislocation  
Say a prayer for Oklahoma say another one for me  
Dislocation, dislocation
