Its old enough to try and tie you down  
So, I just couldn't wait and hang around  
You always said must be free  
But you couldn't see you were loosing me  
And messing up the one good thing we had  
  
[Chorus]  
And now I'm going out the way that I came in  
The game is over now, I couldn't win  
My heart is all I have to pack  
And this time girl I won't be back  
And years from now I'll turn around and see  
The girl I left behind me  
  
I told myself that things would be OK  
You would come around to my way any day  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No, you couldn't change or be rearranged  
I'm picking up the pieces of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No, you couldn't change or be rearranged  
I'm picking up the pieces of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Behind me
