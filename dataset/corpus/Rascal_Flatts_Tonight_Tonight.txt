Ain't nothing better than anticipation  
Tonight's been playing over in my head  
I've had enough of all the expectations  
Waiting's the hardest part, like Tom Petty said  
  
We cutting loose like we were on a mission  
Them stars are shining, it's a perfect night  
I swear, you're looking like a moon-lit vision  
It's taking over, and I won't fight  
  
That's because tonight, tonight,  
Been waiting to see you.  
Tonight, tonight,  
We can't go wrong.  
It feels so right,  
Just being here with you.  
We've been waiting for this moment all day long.  
  
That's because tonight, tonight,  
Been waiting to see you.  
Tonight, tonight,  
We can't go wrong.  
It feels so right,  
Just being here with you.  
We've been waiting for this moment all day long.  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah  
Tonight  
  
The room is spinning like a disco ball  
Everybody's dancing, it's a party y'all  
You move yourself in that graffiti sky  
Gives you that feeling, everything's gonna be alright  
We just got rocking, now we rolling, rolling  
Ain't going home until they're closing, closing  
We'll see the sun before you know it, know it  
And you won't wanna say good-bye  
  
That's because tonight, tonight,  
Been waiting to see you.  
Tonight, tonight,  
We can't go wrong.  
It feels so right,  
Just being here with you.  
We've been waiting for this moment all day long.  
  
Tonight's the night you've waited all week for  
You're gonna take it 'til you just can't take no more  
Better not wait up for me  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight,  
Ahh  
  
That's because tonight, tonight,  
Been waiting to see you.  
Tonight, tonight,  
We can't go wrong.  
It feels so right,  
Just being here with you.  
We've been waiting for this moment.  
  
That's because tonight, tonight,  
Been waiting to see you.  
Tonight, tonight,  
We can't go wrong.  
It feels so right,  
Just being here with you.  
We've been waiting for this moment all day long.  
  
Tonight, tonight
