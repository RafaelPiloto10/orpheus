I wish you could have lived my life  
No way to know  
The fun I had  
I ride in limousines  
But it means nothing  
I roll down the tinted glass  
To see outside  
I like to see how much I pass  
On my roller coaster ride  
It's hard to remember  
Seems I was never young  
  
I wish you could have been right there  
My future was the end of time  
And all the girls I needed  
Never knew me  
I've fallen deep inside my well  
Without a pail  
And if you come to rescue me  
I'll tell my fairy tale  
It's hard to remember  
Seems I was never young  
  
What curtains fall  
On childhood stages  
That never rise  
To show the crowd  
Things I drag  
Throughout the ages  
Never seem  
To speak out loud  
I wish that you were here right now  
  
I guess I passed my chance away  
A pallid grey is mostly what I see now  
I live my life  
And never stop to  
Close the doors  
And all time I never thought  
Of living yours  
It's hard to remember  
Seems I was never young
