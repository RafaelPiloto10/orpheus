Hope in my heart  
As a new day has dawned  
I see your light on the wings of a dove  
Lifting me up as the dark clouds retreat  
Courage transcends and you make me complete  
Hope in my heart with the advent of spring  
I am reborn with the love that you bring  
  
Now at last my dream is real  
I found peace  
True love can heal  
On the journey throughout time  
A new beginning has arrived  
At the crossroads of my life  
This new love keeps me alive  
  
I never knew that this could happen to me  
So many lonely days and nights  
I never knew that you were waiting for me  
Hope was out of sight  
And suddenly I see the future clearly  
No longer living in the past  
As I let go  
  
Living the dream  
Of my life  
I was alone no-one in sight  
This love, make me believe that you're the one  
Never give up, our day has come  
  
I never felt that this could happen to me  
So many lonely days and lonely nights  
I never knew that you were waiting for me  
Hope was out of sight  
And suddenly I see the future clearly  
Finally I know at last  
I can let go  
  
Living the dream  
Of my life  
I was alone no-one in sight  
This love, ill never throw it all away  
Now that your in my life to stay
