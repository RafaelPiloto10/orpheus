I know that you're going  
I can't make you stay  
I can only let you know I love you anyway  
And if the road you take leads to heart break somewhere down the line  
If someone ever hurts you  
Or treats your heart unkind  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
I want you happy, I want the best for you  
And if you have to leave to find your dream  
I hope that dream comes true  
But if the world you find brings you hard times, if someone makes you  
cry  
I'll be there to hold you, I'll be standing by  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
My love is strong enough you know  
Strong enough to let you go  
But I always hold you inside my heart  
And if you should ever change your mind  
You can come back anytime  
And when you do (and when you do)  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you
