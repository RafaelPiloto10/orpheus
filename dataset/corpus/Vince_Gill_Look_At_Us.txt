Look at us  
After all these years together  
Look at us  
After all that we've been through  
Look at us  
Still leaning on each other  
  
If you want to see  
How true love should be  
Then just look at us  
  
Look at you  
Still pretty as a picture  
Look at me  
Still crazy over you  
Look at us  
Still believin' in forever  
  
If you want to see  
How true love should be  
Then just look at us  
  
In a hundred years from now  
I know without a doubt  
They'll all look back and wonder how  
We made it all work out  
  
Chances are  
We'll go down in history  
When they want to see  
How true love should be  
They'll just look at us
