He's watching the girls on the dance floor  
He's watching the light in her hair  
He's praying that love's gonna come soon  
There's a sweet smell of hope in the air  
  
Just another boy from a steel town  
With the flash of the mill in his eye  
He don't move for hip cool or fashion  
But he knows where the deepest one lies  
  
And he'd love to be warm  
And he'd love to love you  
So give him some good news  
  
All the cards on the table  
But don't look that man in the eye  
Say a prayer for the dealer  
And kiss your old life goodbye  
  
Go to church light a candle  
But don't lose your head for God's sake  
Why is my heart beating faster  
Oh why do my hands start to shake  
  
'Cause he'd love to be warm  
And he'd love to love you  
So give him some good news
