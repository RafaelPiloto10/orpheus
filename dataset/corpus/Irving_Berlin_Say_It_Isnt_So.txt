Say it isn't so,  
  
Say it isn't so,  
Everyone is saying  
You don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know,  
  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
People say that you,  
  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long  
Before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true,  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know,  
  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.
