You're always in my heart  
From early in the mornin' til it's dark  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
When I wake up in the mornin'  
And I see you there  
I always whisper a little prayer  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
If my times are bringin' me down  
You're the only one that I want around  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
And if I'm all strung out  
You're the only one who can straighten me out  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
You're always in my heart  
From early in the mornin' til it's dark  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday
