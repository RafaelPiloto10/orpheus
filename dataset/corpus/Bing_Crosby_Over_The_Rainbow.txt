Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true  
  
Someday, I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, why can't I?  
If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh, why can't I?
