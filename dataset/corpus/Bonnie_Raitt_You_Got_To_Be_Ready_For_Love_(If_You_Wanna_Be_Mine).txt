You got to be ready  
You got to be ready, yeah  
  
This woman don't like no nonsense  
I like lovin' every day  
And I don't like to find no evidence, no  
To prove you're giving my love away  
What more can I say  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (ready baby)  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
This woman don't do no hand pickin'  
And I don't think one look is a felony  
And I don't appreciate no rubber neckin', no  
'Bout a man, when he's with me  
Out in the street  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)  
I said you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
Ready for love  
Ready for love  
Got to be ready for love  
  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready, yeah  
  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)  
  
Can't be a cold lover  
Just like my old lover  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to get ready  
You got to stay ready  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)
