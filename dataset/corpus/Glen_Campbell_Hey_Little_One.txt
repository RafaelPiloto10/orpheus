Hey... little one  
So far from home  
And so alone  
  
Hey... little one  
I'm just li-ike you  
I'm lonely too  
  
The road of life is a long long roa-oad  
When you walk alo-o-o-one  
Then I found you  
And I found a lo-ove  
A love I've never know-ow-ow-own  
A love I've never know-own  
  
Hey...  
Hey, Hey, Hey - little one  
Don't go away  
Tell me you'll stay  
  
Hey... Hey, Hey, Hey - little one  
I'm just like you  
I'm so-o lo-onely too...
