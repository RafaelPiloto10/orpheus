My brother Jake,  
Hat, shades,  
Head in a daze.  
My brother Jake,  
Have you though about  
Changin' your ways?  
  
He goes out  
He don't have no doubt  
He don't have to know  
What the world's about.  
  
My brother Jake,  
Head, down,  
It's a scrapin' the ground,  
Jake, stay away,  
You know you can always be down  
  
He goes out  
He don't have no doubt  
He don't have to know  
What the world's about.  
  
I said Jake,  
Now won't you wait,  
What's got into you,  
Your candle is burning  
The wheels are turning  
What you gonna do?  
  
My brother Jake,  
Won't you start again  
Try makin' some friends  
Jake, it's not too late  
To start again, by making amends  
  
He goes out  
He don't have no doubt  
He don't have to know  
What the world's about.  
  
I said Jake,  
Now won't you wait,  
What's gone wrong with you,  
Your candle is burning  
The wheels are turning  
What you gonna do?  
  
I said Jake,  
Don't you wait,  
What's gone wrong with you,  
Your candle is burning  
The wheels of time are turning  
Uh! What you gonna do?  
  
I said Jake, Jake, Jake,  
Don't you wait, wait. wait,  
What's got into you,  
Your candle is burning  
The wheels of time are turning  
Uh! What you gonna do?  
  
Listen, I'm gonna break you Jake,  
Because you got what it takes  
To give a whole lotta people  
Some soul.
