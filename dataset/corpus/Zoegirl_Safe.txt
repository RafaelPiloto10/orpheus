Here I am alone with You  
Quietly I talk to You  
You said the truth would set me free  
So here I am surrendering  
I know I can let Your promise be my hope  
And I know until You take me home  
I'm safe, safe 'cause You love me  
Safe, safe all because Your name  
Has power to calm the ocean  
When everything changes I'm safe  
My heart is overflowing  
With peace beyond all knowing  
This love is deep, it shelters me  
And I'm safe within Your reach  
I know I can let Your promise be my hope  
And I know until You take me home  
Though the odds are stacked against me  
Though I'm running out of time  
My heart is breaking  
But I know that You are mine  
So I let You see into me as You hold me in Your hand  
My heart is on my sleeve  
I'm safe because You understand  
You understand
