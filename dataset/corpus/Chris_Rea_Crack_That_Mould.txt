You got to break the back of the mold you were made in  
Crack the shell, that's how it's got to be  
Nothing for certain, ain't no way of knowing  
Only believe in things that you see  
  
Flow with the river, run with the tide  
Mix with your brother, 'cause he's right by your side  
Crack that mold  
  
Little pretty chicken you can't stay in there forever  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather  
You got to bend, learn, take the rough with the smooth  
Understand everything  
Crack that mold  
  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather  
  
Pick up them shoes, go running down that road  
You know that precondition is such a heavy load  
You got to live love, put down that written word  
Crack that mold  
  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather
