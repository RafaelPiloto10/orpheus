I met a gin soaked barroom queen in Memphis  
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride  
She had to heave me right across her shoulder  
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind  
It's those honky tonk women  
That give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
I laid a divorcee in New York City  
I had to put up some kind of a fight  
I laid her then she covered me with roses  
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind  
It's those honky tonk women  
That give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
Alright  
It's those honky tonk women  
That give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
It's those honky tonk women  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
