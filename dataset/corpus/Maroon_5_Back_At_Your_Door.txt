From the moment the lights went off  
Everything had changed  
Lie awake in an empty room  
In my head it all feels the same  
  
Like the taste of the day you left  
It still lingers on my breath  
And the dampness of tears that left  
The stain where you had wept  
  
All alone with the negligee  
That still hangs off of my bed  
I keep meaning to give it away  
But I just leave it there instead  
  
[Chorus]  
No need to cry about it  
I cannot live without it  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
Why do you do this to me?  
You penetrate right through me  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
  
Three more days till I see your face  
I'm afraid it's far too much  
Cook a meal and fix up the place  
Dial your number, hang it up  
  
If I took you for granted  
I apologize for acting tough  
You're my reason for living  
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, every evening is a bitter fight  
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night  
And I know what your friends say  
"He's just wasting your love and time."  
I will never let you change your mind  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
Every time I wind up back at your door
