Last night, I had a beautiful dream  
Last night, in the wee wee hours, oh yes  
Had a beautiful dream  
Ain't about my childhood sweetheart  
How true and real it seemed  
  
I had dreamt we was walkin' Hand in hand, home from school  
Yeah, I dreamt we was walkin' together  
Hand in hand, home from school  
Yeah, if it hadn't be for you darling  
I'd broke my mother's rule  
  
Yeah, you was only sixteen  
So young and yet so fine  
Yeah, you was only sixteen  
So young, yet so fine  
You said when you'd finish school  
You'd let me take and make you mine  
  
Oh yeah  
Yeah, you had those same pretty eyes  
Same sweet little smile  
You had those same pretty eyes  
Same sweet little smile  
I had dreamt about the sweet things  
We used to do, when you was a child  
  
You were my childhood sweetheart  
Love you now, and loved you then  
You were my childhood sweetheart  
I love you now and I loved you then  
And when I'll leave you down the twilight  
I'll go to sleep and dream again
