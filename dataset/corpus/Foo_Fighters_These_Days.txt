One of these days, the ground will drop out from beneath your feet  
One of these days, your heart will stop and play it's final beat  
  
One of these days, the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing  
One of these days, their bombs will drop and silence everything  
  
But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright  
Easy for you to say  
Your heart has never been broken  
Your pride has never been stolen  
Not yet, not yet, one of these days  
I bet your heart 'll be broken  
I bet your pride 'll be stolen  
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet  
One of these days, one of these days  
  
One of these days, your eyes will close and pain will disappear  
One of these days, you will forget to hope and learn to fear  
  
But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright  
Easy for you to say  
Your heart has never been broken  
Your pride has never been stolen  
Not yet, not yet, one of these days  
I bet your heart 'll be broken  
I bet your pride 'll be stolen  
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet  
One of these days, one of these days  
  
But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright  
Yeah it's alright  
Don't say it's alright, don't say it's alright  
Don't say it's alright  
One of these days your heart will stop and play it's final beat  
  
But it's alright, easy for you to say  
Your heart has never been broken  
Your pride has never been stolen  
Not yet, not yet, one of these days  
I bet your heart will be broken  
I bet your pride will be stolen  
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet  
One of these days  
One of these days  
One of these days
