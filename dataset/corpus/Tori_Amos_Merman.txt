Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Now no one  
Can call you bad  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Finally you're in peppermint land  
  
He's a merman  
He doesn't need your voice  
He's a merman  
  
Go to bed  
Dream instead  
And you will find him  
He's a merman  
To the knee  
Doesn't need something you're not willing to give  
He's a merman  
Doesn't need your voice to cross his lands of ice  
  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Now no one  
Can call you bad  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
Finally you found him  
  
Let it out  
Who could ever say you're not simply wonderful  
Who could ever harm you  
Sleep now  
You're my little goat  
  
Go to bed  
The priests are dead  
And come sing it all again  
Go to bed  
Past the apple orchard  
And you'll feel nice  
  
Two can play  
I said, two can play
