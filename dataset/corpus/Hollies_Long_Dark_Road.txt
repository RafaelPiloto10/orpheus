Long Dark Road  
The Hollies  
(Tony Hicks - Kenny Lynch)  
  
It's over, well over  
In my mind and in my heart  
It's over, well over  
But then again, it didn't have a good start  
You'd tell me, try to sell me  
It could have been all I asked  
It's over, well over  
Yes, there it flows away a distant past  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
And you know I loved you  
Yes, you know I loved you  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
And you know I loved you  
Yes, you know I loved you  
It's over, well over  
And we can't revive what's passed  
It's gone now, moved on now,  
But then again, it didn't have a chance to last  
(No, no, no, a chance to last)  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road  
Now it's a long, dark road  
Yes, it's a long, dark road
