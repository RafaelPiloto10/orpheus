Here's a little song you can all join in with,  
It's very simple and I hope it's new.  
Make your own words up if you want to  
Any old words that you think will do, yeah.  
Yellow, blue, what'll I do?  
Maybe I'll just sit here thinking.  
Black, white, stop the fight.  
Does one of these colours ever bother you?  
  
Here's a little dance you can all join in with,  
It's very simple and I hope it's new.  
Make your own steps up if you want to  
Any old steps that you think will do.  
Left, right, don't get uptight.  
Keep in line and you'll be alright.  
Clap hands, move around  
And make sure no one puts you down.  
  
Here's a little world you can all join in with,  
It's very simple and I hope it's new.  
Make your own life up if you want to  
Any old life that you think will do.  
Love, yeah, it's nothing new.  
There's someone much worse than you are.  
Help me set them free,  
Just be what you want to be.
