You are relentless, I am defenseless  
Why did you knock me down tonight  
You beat me senseless, I just don't get this  
How many times do I have to try  
  
Your whisper, so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
It's impossible to express  
How good it feels  
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed  
So tight I'll never be free  
I'm not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door  
What I'm looking for, I think you should know  
You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
Please don't resist anymore  
I'll never leave you alone  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
You reprimand me, you're so demanding  
But I've got time, I don't mind at all  
You're picture perfect, completely worth it  
You've got my back against the wall  
  
Your whisper, so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
Impossible to express  
How good it feels  
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed  
So tight I'll never be free yea  
I'm not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door  
What I'm looking for, I think you should know  
You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
Please don't resist anymore  
I'll never leave you alone  
  
Can you feel me coming  
I'm screaming, searching, calling  
Paranoid,  
Cause I'm always coming back to you,  
Coming back to you  
And you know how much I missed it  
And you know I can't resist it  
See your lips and just come running  
Right on back to you, right on back to you  
  
Get back in my life, come knock on my door  
What I'm looking for, I think you should know  
You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
I can't do this anymore  
I'll never leave you alone  
  
(Get back in my life)  
Get back in my life  
(come knock on my door)  
Woo!  
(What I'm looking for)  
C'mon now  
I think you should know)  
  
(Get back in my life)  
Yea yea yea  
(come knock on my door) oh  
(What I'm looking for)  
I'll never leave you alone  
(I think you should know)  
  
(Get back in my life) Oh  
(come knock on my door)  
(What I'm looking for)  
Yea yea yea
