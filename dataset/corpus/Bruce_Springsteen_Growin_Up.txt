I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade  
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade  
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch  
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul  
Untouched  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing  
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could
sing  
I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on
standing  
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to
landing  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Come down' I threw
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
  
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard
to hold your breath  
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid  
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little  
Place in the stars  
I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up
