Goodbye, so long  
Were the last words from you  
Seems like you're over  
All the goodness we knew  
  
You think that you're strong  
You think that you don't  
You don't need no one  
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin'  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something you'd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me  
Guess I'll suffer 'til I'm where I belong  
I'm under the pressure  
But I'll keep being strong  
  
You say that you're strong  
You say that you don't need anyone  
What in the world are you telling your friends  
I get confused every time I see them  
They said you needed me  
  
I know the people talk just for the thrill  
But the fact of the matter is still  
They said you needed me  
Take your time, re-invent your mind  
You'll feel better, you'll feel stronger  
Then decide if I'm in your life  
For forever or longer  
  
You think that you're strong  
You think that you don't  
You don't need no one  
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin'  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something you'd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me
