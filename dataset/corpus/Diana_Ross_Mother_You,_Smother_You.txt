I wanna mother you, smother you  
With a love you've never known  
I wanna talk to you  
Say sweet things to you  
  
Let you know that I'm yours alone  
And now you need a lot of loving  
And, my darlin', you need it now  
You've been alone for so long  
You've forgotten what love is all about  
  
Let me rock you in the cradle of my arms  
And let my love protect you from all harm  
I'll be your shelter when you want me to  
I'll be your comfort when you need me to  
  
Mother you, smother you  
With a love that's gentle and true  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
And my love will see you through  
  
Put your head on my shoulder  
Put your hand, darling, in mine  
Just let me take you in my arms  
And love away the loneliness you hide  
  
And when life sometimes gets you down  
And you feel the need to cry  
Oh, I'll be standing by your side  
To be your strength and be your guide  
  
I wanna mother you, smother you  
Show me what love is about  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Take away all of your doubt  
  
Just let me mother you, smother you  
With a love you've never known  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Let me know that I'm yours alone  
  
Ooh, mother you, smother you  
With a love that you've never known  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Let me know that I'm yours alone  
  
Mother you, smother you  
With a love
