There was a little drawing of a heart next to that, followed by an
exclaimation mark. The back of his was covered in stuff... stuff like: Brandon
is not a very nice guy, but Alex is sooooo nice. And that had the exclaimation
thing too. It was just silly crap that hit the spot. And he let himself be
drawn in.

To a dark place  
Walking in light  
Glowing, walking in light  
Gold ring around you, the  
Hues of you, the  
Golden sunlight of you  
  
You bring light in

Cool wind following  
Following after you  
Rising for you  
Your skin beautiful  
Everything comes natural  
Fantastic fan  
Rocking rocking, floating
