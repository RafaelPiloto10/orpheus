Highway Bill's on the rotary still and he can't even feel the painof a sun
dried shoulder and a scar from a boulderthat cut him right across his veinnow
he's suckin' cigar and he's shovelin' tarin the crater of a turnpike
terrainhe's got only one hope, and he wants to elope, 'cuz Highway Jill is
driving him insane.  
  
We gotta get on the road, destiny unboundshe's the one for me we gotta get
outta townwe gotta get on the road, destiny unboundshe's the one for me we
gotta get outta townhighway Jill was a daffodil with a cactus sense of prideat
the wheel of a tractor, she was quite an impactorwhen the road rocks started
to slideshe saw Bill drop his shovel on a pile of gravelas he climbed up out
of his ditchshe was wonderstruck when he climbed in her truckhe said "I've
been havin' this everlasting itch  
  
Chorus  
  
At first she was cold, she was ready to scoldthis guy from the pit with a
thing in his headbut then she thought twice when he melted her icewith his
passionate eyes she was energized! She started the ignition and without
permissionthe two of 'em flew down the dusty roadbut the road wasn't finished
and the pavement diminishedthey soared off the edge and they plunged in the
sludge  
  
She said: There isn't even any road, our Destiny was boundwe were the ones for
us but now we're in the ground(4x)
