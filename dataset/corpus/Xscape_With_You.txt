[Chorus]  
I want to spend my whole life with you,  
There's nothing else better than being with you.  
I want to spend my whole life, my whole life with you.  
  
Do you remember all those precious times,  
We shared back in the past.  
No one knew about the things we did,  
Out in the grass.  
  
We're older now,  
And we both need companionship.  
So let's stop these games,  
And get on with our relationship.  
  
Ain't no second guessin' about  
The way I feel when I'm with you,  
It makes me feel so real.  
Ain't no living without you,  
'Cause you're all the man I need,  
And I want you just for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why is it when I say I love you,  
You shy away from me,  
When lovin's all I want to do?  
Even though we've never been,  
  
More than just friends,  
There's no reason  
We should have to let our feelings end.  
  
Ain't no second guessin' about  
The way I feel when I'm with you,  
It makes me feel so real.  
Ain't no living without you,  
'Cause you're all the man I need,  
And I want you just for me.  
  
[Chorus]
