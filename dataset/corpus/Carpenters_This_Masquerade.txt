Are we really happy with  
This lonely game we play  
Looking for the right words to say  
Searching but not finding  
Understanding anyway  
We're lost in this masquerade  
  
Both afraid to say we're just too far away  
From being close together from the start  
We tried to talk it over  
But the words got in the way  
We're lost inside this lonely game we play  
  
[Chorus]  
Thoughts of leaving disappear  
Each time I see your eyes  
And no matter how hard I try  
To understand the reason  
Why we carry on this way  
And we're lost in this masquerade  
  
We tried to talk it over  
But the words got in the way  
We're lost inside this lonely game we play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're lost in a masquerade
