Eyes, you can trust your eyes  
If you see someone across the room  
You know it's still too soon if you say don't  
Your eyes won't.  
  
Hands they'll understand  
And if you tell them not to touch  
The last time hurt too much  
You can depend on your hands.  
  
But love'd get you anyway hey, hey, hey  
Cause no matter what you say  
Hearts, don't pay no mind, oh hearts  
Rush right in every time and then hearts get torn apart  
What can we do with our foolish hearts?  
  
Your minds a trustworthy kind  
If you say don't start dreamin' now  
It'll try not to somehow  
And you'll find you can trust your mind.  
  
And your voice won't let you down  
If you don't want to say hello  
Well, that's alright you know  
You can count on your voice.  
  
But love'd get you anyway hey, hey, hey  
Cause no matter what you say  
Hearts, don't pay no mind, oh hearts  
Rush right in every time and then hearts get torn apart  
What can we do with our foolish hearts?  
  
Hearts, don't pay no mind, oh hearts  
Rush right in every time and then hearts get torn apart  
What can we do with our foolish hearts?  
  
Hearts, don't pay no mind, oh hearts  
Rush right in every time and then hearts get torn apart  
What can we do with our foolish hearts?
