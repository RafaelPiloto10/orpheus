I mending fence along the road  
Barely holding together  
Mapless zone the road signs holes  
Keep ahead of the weather  
Long past time to close dead eyes  
Find a break in the highway  
Out here I'm invisible  
Very few going my way  
  
Breath on a window, showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home  
  
Ghost town strip of misery  
I ain't feeling no better  
Road kill heart inside of me  
Follow it to the letter  
Sundown brings a welcome change  
Everything that's hiding  
More at home in landscapes strange  
Are you selling I'm buying  
  
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home  
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul  
Connect the dot scribbling  
And you would never know  
  
Failed to heed the signal  
Thought you got through just in time  
Crashing hard upon your ego  
Penetrated from the side  
  
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
