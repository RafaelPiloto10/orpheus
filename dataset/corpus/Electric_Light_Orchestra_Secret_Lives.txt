I don't know  
I don't know what's on your mind  
I thought everything was fine  
But it was my surprise  
  
I don't know  
I don't know what's going on  
Something surely must be wrong  
You're living secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew where I fit in  
Wish that I knew everything  
About your secret lives  
  
If it means  
If it means that much to you  
I don't want to stop the things you do  
I don't need alibis  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
I don't care  
I don't care what goes on there  
So long as one day I can share  
Share your secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Secret lives, secret lives  
Secret lives, secret lives
