It's easy, when you're sorry  
And you're lonely  
I know this girl that spied on her boyfriend  
In case he might miss an fall, he just might miss and fall  
She said it's not that I don't trust him  
I've just gotta be sure, I've just gotta be sure  
I know this kid that signed himself up to a gym  
His palls kepp nagging him about his chicken chest  
"Well you'll never get a girl that way, you've gotta pump up"  
Chorus:  
What if love isn't only about  
And if love isn't only about  
Two people in love with themselves  
What if love isn't only about  
And if love isn't only about  
Two people involved with themselves honey  
Tom goes to law school, his father wants him to  
"You've got to make me proud son, you've got to fill me in  
You've got to lead the life I never lived"  
July's got a baby now no one invites her to a party  
Kids are too inconvenient there days  
July don't care, she don't miss anyting  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Row row row down the river  
Row row row down the road...
