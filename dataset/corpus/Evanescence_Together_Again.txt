Never thought that I'd be leaving you today  
So alone and wondering why I feel this way  
So wide the world  
Can love remember how to get me home to you  
Someday  
  
We'll be together again  
All just a dream in the end  
We'll be together again  
  
So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind  
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find  
  
I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide  
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind  
  
We'll be together again  
All just a dream in the end
