Ride, ride, ride, ride up from hell  
  
Armed with magic sons of demons and men  
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.  
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear  
Black winds blow where we ride near.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.  
  
Hot pitch and chain take to the air  
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.  
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.  
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.  
  
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side  
I fear this wound your last.  
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood  
And I remember days long past.  
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep  
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
  
You who killed my brother and all who take your side  
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.  
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane  
Kill me if you can.  
  
Death is life!  
  
By the full moon they rise from their graves.  
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.  
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood  
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
