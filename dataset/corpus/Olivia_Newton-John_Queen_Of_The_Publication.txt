Something strange is going on  
And you're in the middle  
I'll do anything to solve the riddle  
I've got a city editor  
Put me on a deadline  
If I don't come through  
I'm on the breadline  
I'll invade your privacy  
Please don't take it personally  
I'm oh so sorry  
But the reader's got a right to know  
You're gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
I'll be queen of the publication  
I've got a hidden camera  
A shadow on your tail  
And I'm tape recording every detail  
All the walls have ears tonight  
They're listening in case you might  
Talk in your sleep  
I'm oh so sorry  
But the reader's got a right to know  
You're gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
I'll be queen of the publication  
In every supermarket checkout line  
They'll be staring at your face  
Make you a legend in your own time  
Give you triple column space  
When I get the story right  
I'll be queen  
I'll be queen  
I'll be queen  
I get the story right  
I'll be queen of the publication  
I'm oh so sorry  
But the reader's got a right to know  
You're gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
I'll be queen  
I'll be queen  
I'll be queen  
I'm queen of the publication
