Song name: Divine Exchange  
Artist: Abundant Life Ministries  
  
My heart is captivated Lord, by You alone  
Captured by the awesomeness of You alone  
Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown  
I stand in wonder  
  
I reach to You, the One who makes the blind eyes see  
Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority  
Restoring what was broken  
So it may fly again  
  
I live to worship You  
I breathe to worship You  
All of my days, your face I'll seek  
  
For as I worship You  
You lead me to that place  
To that place of divine exchange
