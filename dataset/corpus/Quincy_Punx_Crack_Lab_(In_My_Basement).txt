I've got a cracklab in my basement  
I'm a shining example of a junior acheivement  
Cooking up drugs on my chemistry set  
Twenty-seven grand a week is what I get  
[Chorus:]  
I've got a cracklab in my basement  
Please don't tell my mommy on me  
I've got a cracklab in my basement  
Every kid needs a hobby  
I'm the only kid on my block with an uzi  
All the other fourth graders are jealous of me  
I'll be a millionaire by the time I'm thirteen  
I'm a perfect example of an American dream  
[Repeat Chorus]  
My parents are dumb they'll never suspect  
And if they do I'll just tell em its a science fair project  
My cub scout troop does the distribution  
And I'm thinking of expanding into prostitution  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Bridge:]  
You mix it up, You cook it down  
You serve it up out on the playground  
Crack Lab  
[Repeat first verse]  
[Repeat chorus]  
[Repeat bridge]
