Big John, big John  
  
Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive  
He stood 6 foot 6, weighed 245  
Kind of broad at the shoulders, narrow at the hip  
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Nobody seemed to know where John called home  
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone  
He didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy  
And if you spoke at all, you'd just said hi to big John  
  
Somebody said he came from New Orleans  
Where he got into a fight over a Cajun Queen  
And a crushing blow from a huge right hand  
Sent a Louisiana fella to the promise land  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine  
When a timber cracked and men started crying  
Minors were praying, and hearts beat fast  
And everybody thought they had breathed their last 'cept John  
  
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell  
Walked a giant of a man that the minors knew well  
Grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan  
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
And with all of his strength, he gave a mighty shove  
Then a minor yelled out, "There's a light up above!"  
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave  
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John  
  
With jacks and timbers, they started back down  
Then came that rumble way down in the ground  
And as smoke and gas smelched out of that mine  
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Now they never reopened that worthless pit  
They just placed a marble stand in front of it  
These few words are written on that stand  
'At the bottom of this mine, lies one hell of a man, big John'  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John
