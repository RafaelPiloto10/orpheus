Brother Flower, are you listenin'?  
Let me sing a song for you  
Brother Flower, petals glistenin',  
In the bashful mornings dew  
Brother Flower, when the sun shines  
And the dew has flown away  
If you don't mind weak and wrong rhymes  
Brother Flower, may I stay?  
  
Brother Flower, you ain't lonely  
For you've always been alone  
But I haven't been so lucky  
I had love and now it's gone  
I have arms to hold another  
Never to hold her again  
I have life to give lover  
You have life to give the wind  
  
Brother Flower, when the snow flies  
And you lay your beauty down  
Brother Flower, are you sleepin'  
There upon the cold, cold ground  
Brother Flower, please awaken  
Show the sky your face of blue  
Let me know I ain't forsaken  
Seems like all I have is you
