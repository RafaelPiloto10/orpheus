I'm here alone on the telephone line  
I'm right where you want me to be  
And I'll wait alone and never ask why  
I'll be where you want me to be  
  
And I know  
I've been here before and I know your kind  
You're right where I want you to be  
Now I'll say what I think  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
(Just to be who I am)  
What do you want me to be?  
  
You'll be on your knees  
  
Tell me  
Tell me it's not true
