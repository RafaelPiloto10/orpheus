You've got a body like the devil  
And you smell like sex  
I can tell your trouble, but I'm still obsessed  
Because you know you're so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
Yeah  
Come on  
Yeah  
  
You like the kiss of death  
Like the hand of fame  
I can tell your trouble  
But I still wanna taste  
Because you know your so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
because you know you're so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
So hott  
I wanna get you alone  
I wanna...get you stoned  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
See you again
