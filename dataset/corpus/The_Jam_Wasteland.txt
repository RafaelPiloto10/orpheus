Meet me on the wastelands - later this day  
We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe  
For there's not much else to do in this drab and colorless place  
We'll sit amongst the rubber tyres  
Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac  
People have no use for - amongst the smoldering embers of yesterday  
  
And when or if the sun shines  
Lighting our once beautiful features  
We'll smile but only for seconds  
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life  
A brave but useless show of compassion  
And that is forbidden in this drab and colorless world  
  
Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind  
The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war  
The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities  
Councils call homes  
  
And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen  
The holy Coca-Cola tins - the punctured footballs  
The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles  
We'll sit and probably hold hands  
  
And watch the rain fall - watch it - watch it  
Tumble and fall - tumble and falling  
Like our lives - like our lives  
Just like our lives  
  
We'll talk about the old days  
When the wasteland was release when we could play  
And think - without feeling guilty  
Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands  
Tumble and fall - tumble and falling  
Like our lives - like our lives  
Exactly like our lives
