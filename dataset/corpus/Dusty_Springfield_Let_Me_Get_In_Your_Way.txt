(Please)  
(Let me get in your way)  
Call me sad and blue  
All I need is your good lovin'  
Just to see me through  
Call me lonely, too  
You should never, ever make me  
Need you like I do  
Can't you see I'm not naggin', baby?  
This heart of mine is just saggin', baby  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' to say to me  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
I'm not asking you  
To move a mountain, swim a river  
Or walk on the moon  
Call me beggin', too  
For a little of the love I need  
So much from you  
Can't you see I'm not naggin', baby?  
This heart of mine is just saggin', baby  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
Oh, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me, ooh  
Oh, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have something you can say to me  
Baby, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
Baby, please, please, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have something you can say, baby
