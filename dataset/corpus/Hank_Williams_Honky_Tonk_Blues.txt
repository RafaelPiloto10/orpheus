Well I left my home down on the rural route  
I told my paw I'm going steppin' out and get the  
Honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes  
Woke up this mornin' wishin' I could lose  
Them jumpin' honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
Well I stopped into every place in town  
This city life has really got me down  
I got the honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got em,  
Got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm  
And scat right back to my pappy's farm  
And leave these honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
When I get home to my Ma and Pa,  
I know they're gonna lay down the law.  
About the honky tonk blues,  
Them jumpin' honkty tonk blues.  
Lord I'm suffrin' with the honky tonk blues.
