Why is my heart so light  
Why are the stars so bright  
Why is the sky so blue  
Since the hour I met you  
Flowers are smiling bright  
Smiling for our delight  
Smiling so tenderly  
For the world, you and me  
I know why my world is smiling  
Smiling so tenderly  
It is the same old story  
Through all eternity  
  
Love, this is my song  
Here is a song, a serenade to love  
  
The world cannot be wrong  
If in this world, there is you  
I care not what the world may be saying  
Without our love, there is no day  
So love, this is my song  
Here is a song, a serenade to you  
  
I care not what the world may be saying  
Without your love, there is no day  
So love, this is my song  
Here is my song, a serenade to you
