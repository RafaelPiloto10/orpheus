Annabelle Lee, Annabelle Lee,  
  
Oh the moon never beams  
Without bringing me dreams  
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee  
And the stars never rise  
But I see the bright eyes  
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee  
  
Were never apart for I gave her my heart  
She gave her heart to me  
And I love with a love  
That is more than just love  
My adorable Annabelle Lee  
  
Yes he gave his warm heart to sweet Annabelle Lee  
For he loved her so dearly you see  
To think of her charms  
Have been here in my arms  
To think she loves only me  
  
Heaven offers no more,  
I've been there before  
In the arms of my Annabelle Lee  
Annabelle Lee
