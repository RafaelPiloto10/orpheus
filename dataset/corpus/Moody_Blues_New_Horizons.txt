Well I've had dreams enough for one  
And I've got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
Where is this place that we have found?  
Nobody knows where we are bound  
I long to hear, I need to see  
'cause I've shed tears too many for me, me  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
On the wind soaring free  
Spread your wings, I'm beginning to see  
Out of mind far from view  
Beyond the reach of a nightmare come true  
Well I've had dreams enough for one  
And I got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday, someway
