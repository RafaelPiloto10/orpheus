Something I forgot that I used to know  
Keeps on coming back around.  
Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn  
Like a light from down the hall.  
Suddenly some old familiar music  
Songs I know I've never heard before.  
I gotta play along I can't refuse it  
I hear the call.  
  
We've all been so proud of our blindness  
No kindness to share  
  
[Chorus]  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say  
To bring us together.  
  
We can make it better  
We can make it right.  
  
We hide behind the veil of our own success,  
While we're following the rules.  
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands  
To the never changing truth.  
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,  
Justice needs to try her other arm.  
Some of us could push a little harder  
To sound the alarm.  
And I see children marching  
And I hear the drums again  
  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say.  
If we hope and pray,  
It will come, give it half a chance.  
Everyone, understand  
In our hearts and our mind,  
You know there's nothing left to hide,  
We're already there.  
  
I used to cry.  
Cry for the lost I was walking away.  
I used to try to find a reason.  
Then I looked inside,  
I used to mind every time I was walking away,  
I gotta find what I'm feeling  
To bring us together.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats till fade]
