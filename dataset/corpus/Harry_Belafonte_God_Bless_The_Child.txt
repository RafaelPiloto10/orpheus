Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the bible says and it still is news  
Mama may have papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That got its own, that got its own  
  
Yes the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got its own, that's got its own  
  
Money you've got lots of friends  
Crowding around the door  
When you're gone  
And the spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Rich relations give  
Crusts of bread and such  
You can help your self  
But don't take to much  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got its own, that's got its own
