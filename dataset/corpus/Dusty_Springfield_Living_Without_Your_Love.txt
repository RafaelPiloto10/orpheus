If I passed you on the street  
Would you look the other way  
Afraid that we would meet  
Could it be that it's down to tears?  
After all the love we knew  
It was so hard losing you  
Now I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you, ooh, oh  
  
I try to put the thoughts away  
But I see your face before me  
As you turn to walk away  
And I can force a smile  
'Cause it turned out so wrong  
After feeling so right so long  
And I'm just not ready for another day alone  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
Yeah, yeah  
I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love, oh  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside  
Lord knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
I'm, just living  
Oh, living without your love  
I'll get by  
But I'm paying, yeah  
Without your love  
I can't get back to much more love  
Oh no  
I'm not ready for  
I'm not ready for  
Love and loneliness  
Living, oh yes, I'm living without your love  
I'll just get by  
I'm just getting by  
I can't stand it much longer  
Ah, living, living without
