Think that I know you, but I just can't place the face  
Got something to show you, it can never be replaced  
Wherever we walk, wherever we fly  
Wherever we live, wherever we die  
Think that I know you, but I just can't say goodbye  
  
This is it  
Hey now, don't it make you feel better? Come and get it!  
This is it  
Here we go, we going to fly  
Come and get it!  
This is it  
Hey now, don't it make you feel better? Come and get it!  
This is it  
Here we go, we going high  
Come and get it!  
  
Remember the rising when the lightning filled the air  
No compromising in a strapped electric chair, you were there  
We never could walk, we always could fly  
We never could live, we always could die  
Think that I know you but I just can't talk, too high  
Think that I know you but I just talk too high  
Over your horse and ride  
  
Do you know a better way to make it all good inside?  
All the friends have died away, by a new law they abide  
And all Gods' children, there they go, judgement on their side  
Do you know a better way, to make it all good inside?  
And I cry does it make you feel better, sing it  
  
All Gods' children, there they go, taking the free ride
