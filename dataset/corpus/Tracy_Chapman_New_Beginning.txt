The whole world's broke and it ain't worth fixing  
It's time to start all over, make a new beginning  
There's too much pain, too much suffering  
Let's resolve to start all over make a new beginning  
  
Now don't get me wrong I love life and living  
But when you wake up and look around at everything that's going down  
All wrong  
You see we need to change it now, this world with too few happy endings  
We can resolve to start all over make a new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
The world is broken into fragments and pieces  
That once were joined together in a unified whole  
But now too many stand alone There's too much separation  
We can resolve to come together in the new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
We can break the cycle - We can break the chain  
We can start all over - In the new beginning  
We can learn, we can teach  
We can share the myths the dream the prayer  
The notion that we can do better  
Change our lives and paths  
Create a new world  
  
And Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
The whole world's broke and it ain't worth fixing  
It's time to start all over, make a new beginning  
There's too much fighting, too little understanding  
It's time to stop and start all over  
Make a new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
We need to make new symbols  
Make new signs  
Make a new language  
With these we'll define the world  
  
And start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over ...
