Being 'round you is driving me crazy  
Watching you run is making me lazy  
You're trying to buy a place in my head  
Telling me lines I've already read  
Speaking my name to try to confuse me  
Say it again you're starting to lose me  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
You're building my prison brick by brick  
Eating your words is making me sick  
You get what you want 'cause nothing is sacred  
You're reading my mind and leaving me naked  
You say I gotta give before I receive it  
One of these days I'll believe it  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me
