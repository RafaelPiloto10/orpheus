In the front row at the Melt Show  
I fell in love with you and that was three weeks ago  
We fooled around, you let me have it for free  
Yeah, it worked out, out real nice  
I showed you how to and you showed me paradise  
Now you're killing time and it's killing me  
Oh, and is this more than some old summer fling?  
Oh, this thing we have, will it mean anything?  
Oh, when October rolls around, will you sober up and let me down?  
Will you sober up and let me?  
Out in schoolyard, out the back door  
I used to love it but I don't believe in school no more  
You don't learn anything, you're just waitin' around  
With your big brains and your know how  
If there's was a reason you'd have figured it out by now  
A little gettin' some's good, while you're waitin' around  
Oh, is this more than some old summer fling?  
This thing we have, will it mean anything?  
Oh, when October rolls around, will you sober up and let me down?  
Will you sober up and let me?  
Now, my bad dream is my best friend  
You were here last night but now you're gone again  
I'm getting tired of you getting tired of me  
Oh, is this more than some old summer fling?  
This thing we have, will it mean anything?  
Oh, when October rolls around, will you sober up and let me down?  
Will you sober up and let me down?  
Will you sober up and let me?
