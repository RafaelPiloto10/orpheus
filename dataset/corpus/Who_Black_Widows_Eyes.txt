You jumped out of an alley  
With surprise in your black widow's eyes  
I was prepared to be unprepared  
Been preparing for lights  
  
I fell right in love with you  
Into a thousand parts I blew  
I fell right in love with you  
  
I was caught in a corner  
He recoiled from a broken romance  
Taking breath after once undead  
I had a firm grip on my pants  
  
I fell right in love with you  
Through a hundred hearts you flew  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Strange that when infatuation calls  
We think that we've got real love in our life  
It pumps like the pressure in a station hall  
As the express train thunders on by  
  
I fell right in love with you  
As the blood came blowing through  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Across the room  
I saw your eyes  
Black window looking back at me  
You held a gun  
As children cried  
You touched some wires  
They shattered me  
  
I was blown into a blue  
There'd been nothing I could do  
I fell right in love with you  
  
I rose up to the station  
Smelt your scent by the door  
You stood waiting so patient  
Just one wait, then no more  
  
I fell right in love with you  
There'd been nothing I could do  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Across the room  
I saw your eyes  
Black window looking back at me  
You held a gun  
As children cried  
You touched some wires  
They shattered me
