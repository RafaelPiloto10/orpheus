How many times must I tell you  
I will not pretend  
Will it ever end  
Guess there's a need to condemn  
What I defend  
  
Say what you will  
In for the kill  
I'll stand my ground  
At any sacrifice  
  
Tearing my heart out  
And serve it to you on a plate  
Bitter to the taste  
One bite is all you can take  
the rest's thrown away  
  
Left on my own  
Cold as a stone  
No matter what you imply  
I'll survive at any sacrifice  
  
I'm walking a wasteland  
Where beauty and truth can't be seen  
A never ending game  
The world keeps on turning but I  
will stay the same
