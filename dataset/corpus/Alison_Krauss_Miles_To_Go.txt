It's feelin' longer now than it ever has before  
Another memory is another slammin' door  
It's gettin' too dark now to see  
  
Every photograph is another lesson learned  
Every sleepless night is another page I've turned  
I wake up to fallin' dreams  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
  
If I had a chance, I must've missed it long ago  
If I could run away, I wouldn't have to let you go  
This angel's bound to stray  
  
Like an hourglass, I'm a soul to sinkin' sand  
You try to hold my heart and I will slip right through your hands  
Time just blows away  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And the tears forever flow  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And this angel's bound to stray  
It's another shade of miles and miles to go
