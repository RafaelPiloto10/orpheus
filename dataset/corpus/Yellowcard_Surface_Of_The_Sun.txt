This is a story full of restless nights  
Of do or do not 'cause there is no try  
Across a decade we flew high and we fell low  
And getting up when we're dragged down is all we've known  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
Here in this Angel City lights will shine  
(Lights will shine)  
And for a while we let ourselves go blind  
But now we know who loves and loves us not  
And they're worth every good thing we have lost  
  
(Ooh!)  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones(Born to be)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
We were born to be the ones  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
(Ooh!)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
  
And all the million miles to go  
Not over yet, not even close  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
(Ooh!)  
  
We were born to be the ones  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
(Ooh!)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun
