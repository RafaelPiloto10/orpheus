I'll worship at Your throne  
Whisper my own love song  
With all my heart I'll sing  
For You, my dad and King  
I'll live for all my days  
To put a smile on Your face  
And when we finally meet  
It'll be for eternity  
And oh, how wide You open up Your arms  
When I need Your love  
And how far You would come  
If ever I was lost  
You said that all You feel for me  
Is undying love  
That You showed me through the cross  
I'll worship You, my God  
I'll worship You, my God  
I love You, I love You  
Forever I will sing  
Forever I will be with You  
I'll be with You  
I'll worship at Your throne  
Whisper my own love song  
With all my heart I'll sing  
For You, my dad and King  
I'll live for all my days  
To put a smile on Your face  
And when we finally meet  
It'll be for eternity  
And oh, how wide You open up Your arms  
When I need Your love  
And how far You would come  
If ever I was lost  
You said that all You feel for me  
Is undying love  
That You showed me through the cross  
I'll worship You, my God  
I'll worship You, my God  
I love You, I love You  
Forever I will sing  
Forever I will be with You  
I'll be with You  
I'll worship You, my God  
I'll worship You, my God  
I love You and I love You  
Forever I will sing  
Forever I will be with You  
I'll be with You
