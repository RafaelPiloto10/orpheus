Here, a little sympathy, for you to waste on me I know you're faking it, but
that's OK  
And I  
Don't want to drag it out  
Don't want to bring you down  
I never wanted it to end this way  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
Here, a little jealousy, I hope you think of me  
Hope you wonder where I sleep at night  
Cause I feel like I'm inside out  
You got me upside down  
Maybe I was holding on too tight  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
So don't you say goodbye to me  
Just turn your back away and leave  
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret your only friend  
  
The two of us we dream like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us take breath like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us we dream like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us take breath like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
I guess that this is over now  
I guess it's called a falling out  
But every day I'm learning how to make it though this life I'm in  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
So don't you say goodbye to me  
Just turn your back away and leave  
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret your only friend
