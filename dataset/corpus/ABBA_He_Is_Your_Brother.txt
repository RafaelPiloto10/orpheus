Benny I was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
And my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
But then it happened one night  
As I got into a fight  
I could hear someone saying  
As though he was praying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
I was a woman, never thinking of others  
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way
