I see my own reflection in the window  
I hear the people carry'n on below  
I know the one I love is out there somewhere  
To me that somewhere's not far to go  
  
Ev'ry year I make my resolution  
To find my love and make her all my own  
But it looks like she decided not to show again  
And I'll be singing 'Auld Lang Syne' alone  
  
People grow accustomed to their lifestyles  
It's easier to settle in your ways  
I wish that I had someone to get used to  
To settle down until my dying days  
  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
All I wanted was an angel that I don't expect to see  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
  
It don't mean nothing if you're crying all the time  
And there's no one there to see your tears  
And it don't mean nothing if you're passing up your prime  
And I been passing mine for years  
  
And so, to my reflection in the window  
I'll raise my glass and make a toast to you  
I've never known a man to be heartbroken  
My someone that he never even knew  
  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
All I wanted was an angel that I don't expect to see  
Nothin' new for new year for me
