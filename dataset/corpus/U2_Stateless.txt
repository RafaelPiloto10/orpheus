I've got no home in this world  
Just gravity  
Luck and time  
  
I've got no hope in this world  
Just you  
And you are not mine  
  
Stateless  
Faithless  
Stateless  
  
There are no colors in your eyes  
There's no sunshine in your skies  
There's no race, only the prize  
There is no tomorrow, only tonight  
  
Stateless  
It's the difference  
  
You can cover the world with your thumb  
Still so big, so bright, so beautiful  
  
Faithless  
Stateless  
  
Push down on me  
Push down on me  
Push your weight down  
Your weight down on me  
Your weight (down on me)  
When your weight falls down on me  
Be the heavy hand  
The mortal sand  
Be the weight, heart, down on me  
  
Stateless  
Faithless  
Hey bliss
