Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Released as a uk b-side in november, 1973  
  
Sitting here on christmas eve with a brandy in my hand  
Oh i've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand  
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace  
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race  
  
And i keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise  
The bearded weirdy's just arrived  
  
  
Ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise  
The bearded wierdy's just arrived  
  
  
On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head  
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red  
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue  
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room
