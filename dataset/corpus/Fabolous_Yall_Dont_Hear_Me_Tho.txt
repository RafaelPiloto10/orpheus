[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Sometimes I amaze, sometimes I disappoint  
Sometimes I blow this paper like it's just a joint  
Sometimes I look at change like it's just some coins  
Like shaq at the line, you prolly missed the point  
It's perspective, which angle you looking from?  
When you take a chance, ever wonder who you took it from?  
I'm from brooklyn son, got no problem taking nothing  
So I figured I could take nothing and make it something  
Tell 'em faking ass niggas they won't make it frontin  
Tell 'em girls lose they clothes and get to shaking somethin  
Purple weed, gold bottles now let's laker something  
Cause y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking on loud  
Swagga to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks, I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low, don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really  
  
[Verse 2: fabolous]  
Might be how I'm feeling mixed with what I'm drinking  
Got me on some shit, that might be what the stink is  
You might just be cool it might be what you thinking  
It might be something in her eye but to me, she's winking  
Listen before ya dumb ass say some stupid shit  
And have my dog laying on your house on some snoopy shit  
Ball player swag, that's what out the hoop and shit  
Two chicks that hanging with mr cooper shit  
Eat with me if you hungry dawg  
But then again how loyal is a hungry dawg?  
That's saying hunger make your dog eat you alive  
You either starve to death or you eat to survive  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking on loud  
Swagga to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks, I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low, don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really  
  
[Verse 3: red cafe]  
Shakedown on sleep  
I'm getting to the money  
The way I'm counting sheep  
I be counting money  
Live from the roof  
Empire state  
Finna burn this bitch down  
Find the next fire escape  
I'm high so nothing ain't farfetched  
Out in houston with my rocket no...  
Fuck with that street fan  
Fuck with that loso  
Come to your city spend some tickets at the go-go  
Giving back to the hood be what I call it  
Smoke grand daddy kush  
I'm in orbit  
If they ain't with the family they weirdos  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking all out  
Swagger to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really
