Draggin' old Mustang '69  
Top dropped back an' lookin' fine  
Workin' the groove, backin' up with Scotch  
Lookin' like Sir Lancelot  
What it is, brother?  
What it is, kid?  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is?  
Lookin' to sway by the evenin' shade  
But I ain't ready to behave  
An' that ain't bad on the other hand  
Detroit rocks like the Rio Grande  
What it is, brother?  
What it is, kid?  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is?  
What it is? What it is?  
What it is? What it is?  
What it is? What it is?
