One two, one two three  
Well, I went and gave away my TV  
Told the man, "Cut off the phone"  
I put an ad in the paper, baby, gonna sell everything I own  
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through  
But there's just no getting over you  
Well, I went and bought myself a new straw hat  
One eye pokin' under the brim, I bought myself a little seaside shack  
In case I might just want to swim  
Done everything I know in the world to try to shake these blues  
But there's just no getting over you  
Well, I try and try but honey it ain't no use  
Cry and cry, I just can't turn you loose  
Why oh why, can't I get you off my mind?  
You got that hook so far in baby, I gotta get you off my line  
Well, I got some transcendental meditation, baby  
And I'm taking up Japanese, I signed up at the cooking school  
I'm going to pick up on some hard cuisine  
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through  
But there's just no getting over you  
Honey I, I tried and I tried baby it ain't no use  
Cried and I cried but I just can't turn you loose  
Why oh, why can't I get you off my mind?  
Honey, you got that hook so far in, I just got to get you off my line  
Oh, I have much and I'm a fool for you baby, lay back in, stand on  
Now listen to this [Incomprehensible]  
You know the way you do, honey  
Well, I just can't make it over, can't seem to make it baby  
No matter what I say or do baby, I can't make it over, ooh  
Well, there's just no getting over you, that's a truth
