When the visions around you,  
Bring tears to your eyes.  
And all that surrounds you,  
Are secrets and lies.  
I'll be your strength  
I'll give you hope,  
Keeping your faith when it's gone.  
The one you should call,  
Was standing here all alone.  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms,  
And hold you right were you belong.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you...  
This I promise you...  
I've loved you forever,  
In lifetimes before.  
And I promise you never...  
Will you hurt anymore.  
I give you my word,  
I give you my heart.  
This is a battle we've won.  
And with this vow,  
Forever has now begun...  
Just close your eyes,  
Each lovin' day.  
And know this feeling won't go away.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you...  
Over and over I fall...  
When I hear you call...  
Without you in my life, baby.  
I just wouldn't be living at all...  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms,  
And hold you right were you belong.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you, baby.  
Just close your eyes,  
Each lovin' day.  
And know this feeling won't go away.  
Every word I say is true...  
This I promise you...  
I promise you...
