Everything  
Everything reminds me  
Easily  
You walking out so easily  
No goodbyes  
Not even a tear for me  
Now you cry  
Youd like to have my company  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
No more lies  
I don't need this anymore  
I've heard it all  
Now I'm gonna close the door  
Seems to me  
Nothing comes that easily  
Time to leave  
Youll take it all and run from me  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone
