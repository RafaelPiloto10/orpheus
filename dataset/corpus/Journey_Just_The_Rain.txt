Once in your life you love  
Once in your life you try  
The one you're holdin'  
Is the one that tears you apart  
  
Deep in her arms you lie  
Deep in the night her eyes  
Tell your secrets  
To the one you try to deny  
  
Touch me, touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
  
Inside you keep on lyin'  
Inside your soul is dyin'  
You still can't hold back  
Still you can't say good-bye  
Touch me, touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain...  
No reasons why, no one's to blame  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
It's just the rain, It's just the rain,  
It's just the rain, It's just the rain  
Falling, falling, falling  
It's just the rain
