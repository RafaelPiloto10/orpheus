Chorus:  
Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en night,  
Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en night.  
  
Encourage your children to make up their own verses to reflect the costumes
they'll be wearing.  
Below are some sample verses for inspiration!  
  
I'm gonna be a ghost, gonna wear a funny sheet  
Gonna scare everybody, I meet along the street  
You'll see me at the door, with all my spooky friends  
Screaming for candy, with wide open hands.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a fairy princess, as pretty as can be  
Dancing from door to door, you'll really love me.  
I'm looking for a prince, who won't give me a fright  
We'll live happily ever after, well at least for tonight.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a cavegirl, living years ago  
Playing with the dinosaurs, it's fun to watch them go  
You'll see me on the street, with clothing made of fur  
With all my spooky monster friends, who are gonna cause a stir.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a witch, put snakes in my hair,  
Everyone will run away, but I don't really care.  
I'll look really freaky, riding on my broom  
My cat will be behind me, screeching at the moon  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a cowboy, a-ridin' on the range  
I'll be ridin' on my horse, and I'll be acting really strange  
I won't be making spooky sounds, I won't be saying 'boo'  
But I'll be riding  
  
Rap:  
Spooky, spooky, very spooky,  
Don't look at me cause I'm too kooky  
Kooky, kooky, very kooky,  
Give me a treat, give me a cookie  
Cookie, cookie, come and lookie,  
Look at the way I eat my cookie.
