When the whistle blows  
And the goodbye hugs are over  
Then the train pulls out of the station and rolls towards the dawn  
With that old suitcase in hand and a surefire plan gone over  
This time it will work it can't go wrong  
Cause I've got all of our dreams mixed up with my schemes  
Rollin' around in my mind  
I know the sun's gonna shine  
Shine on me this time  
In a week or two  
I'll be writing to you with good news  
And I can just see your smile as you read about all that I've done  
Cause I've got all of our plans right here in my hands  
And things are gonna work out just fine  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine  
Shine on me this time  
I've seen confusion in your eyes  
I've seen uncertainty and fear  
Keep on lookin' for tomorrow  
Soon it will be here  
This time, it's gonna be this time  
This time, it's gotta be this time  
This time, this time (it's never never)  
This time, this time (the day is coming)  
This time, this time (it's never never)  
This time, this time (the day is coming)
