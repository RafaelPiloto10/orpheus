I'm sitting here sad and lonely.  
Thinkin' 'bout my one and only.  
I been sittin' here cryin' my eyes out.  
Feelin' sorry for myself 'cause I just don't know what it's all about.  
No, I just don't know.  
  
But, I miss my baby.  
I'm lookin' for a lady.  
Said I miss my baby.  
I think I'm goin' crazy.  
Well, I miss my baby.  
I'll die without her maybe...yeah, yeah.  
I'm lookin' for my baby.  
Alright, 'n allright.  
  
I never had a lick of worry.  
'cause she was always in a hurry.  
She was eager just to please her baby.  
But, I miss her and it's drivin' me crazy.  
Oh so crazy.  
  
But, I miss my baby.  
I'm lookin' for a lady.  
Said I miss my baby.  
I think I'm goin' crazy.  
Well, I miss my baby.  
I think I'll join the navy...yeah, yeah.  
I'm lookin' for my baby.  
Alright, alright, yeah.
