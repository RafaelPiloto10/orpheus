I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now she's mine and I spend my times dreamin' about her  
  
Love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad  
  
She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money, no, no  
We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny  
  
Ah, I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad  
  
Whoo  
I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now she's mine and I spend my time dreamin' about her  
  
I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad
