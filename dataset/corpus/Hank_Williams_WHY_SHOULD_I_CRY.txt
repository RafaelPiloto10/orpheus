Why should I cry? I never done you wrong  
I kept my vows, you left me all alone  
You told me you loved me, you told me a lie  
Why should I pay? Tell me why should I cry?  
You knew I worshiped you right from the start  
Gave you my love, never thought that we'd part  
You didn't care enough to even say goodbye  
Why should I pay? Tell me why should I cry?  
You know I miss you, now that you're gone  
Life can be sad when you're livin' all alone  
But, darlin', I'll forget you, your memory will die  
Why should I pay? Tell me why should I cry?
