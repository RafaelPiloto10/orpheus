I'm staring at the gorund,  
I'm bloodless, thrown away from the sun  
What's lost cannot be found  
I can't return your tears  
If i ever live to be a thousand years  
I'm staring at the ground  
I never wished you a broken heart  
Coincidence put you down  
He won't withdraw those tears  
  
If you ever lived to be a thousand years  
What do I have to say to make you stay?  
What do I have to do to make you happy?  
I'm staring at the ground  
I wish I could bring the spring to your door  
To the coldest side of town  
I carry your wounded dreams  
Like the devil's deeds in the pocket of my jeans  
What do I have to say to make you stay?  
What do I have to do to make you happy?
