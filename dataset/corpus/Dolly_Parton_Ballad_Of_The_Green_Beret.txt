  
Fighting soldiers from the sky  
Fearless men who jump and die  
Men who mean just what they say  
The brave men of the Green Beret  
  
1st Chorus:  
  
Silver wings upon their chest  
These are men, America's best  
One hundred men we'll test today  
But only three win the Green Beret  
  
Trained to live, off nature's land  
Trained in combat, hand to hand  
Men who fight by night and day  
Courage deep from the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus  
  
Delta Force and CIA  
Marines and SOCOM clear the way  
Covert missions now in play  
Special OPS like the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus  
  
While back at home a young wife waits  
Her Green Beret has met his fate  
He has died for those oppressed  
Leaving her this last request  
  
2nd Chorus:  
  
Put silver wings on my son's chest  
Make him one of America's best  
He'll be a man they'll test one day  
So have him win the Green Beret  
Have him win the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus
