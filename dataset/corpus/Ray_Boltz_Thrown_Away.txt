Thrown Away  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Grandpa and me, every week or so  
Wed go walking down a country road  
Looking for something  
Others drove right past  
Maybe they were late  
And they were dogging the throttle  
Maybe they just  
Didnt notice the bottles  
Shining like diamonds in the grass  
We would pick them up  
And wed cash 'em in  
Hed look at me and Id look at him  
And hed say  
CHORUS:  
Thrown away  
Can you believe the things  
They toss aside  
And leave em where they lay?  
Oh, but they can be saved  
If you will take the time  
And try to find the good  
Along the way  
Oh, what this world throws away  
Many years later  
When my age had doubled  
I met a man and his name was Trouble  
He said, Son, Ill give you some advice  
A family is fine  
And theres a time you need them  
But sure enough there will come  
A time to leave em  
You know you only get one life  
He was a lonely man  
Without a single friend  
He looked at me and I looked at him  
And I said,  
CHORUS  
And maybe someday  
When the little ones have grown  
I may have a grandchild of my own  
And if I do, I can promise you  
One day well walk down a country road  
CHORUS
