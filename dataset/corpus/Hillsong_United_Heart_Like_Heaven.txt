Holy  
No measure knows Your worth  
Face down  
Where mercy finds me first  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If You sought perfection  
I'd die trying to reach it  
But this broken heart is all You want  
  
[Chorus]  
Singing holy  
Heart like heaven  
Singing holy  
God Almighty  
Own this heart broke sound  
Singing holy is Your Name  
Singing holy is Your Name  
  
[Bridge]  
Own the sound forever  
Heart and heaven together  
Singing holy is Your Name  
  
And if it lifts You higher  
Burn in me Your desire  
A passion worthy of Your Name  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I'll throw my weakness  
Into Your greatness  
If this broken heart is all You want  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You're worthy of all praise (2x)  
  
For You are worthy  
Jesus Saviour  
You are worthy  
King forever  
Hear my soul cry out  
Singing holy is Your Name
