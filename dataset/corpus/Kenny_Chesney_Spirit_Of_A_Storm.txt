There's a spirit of a storm in my soul  
A restlessness that I can't seem to tame  
Thunder and lightning follow everywhere I go  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul.  
  
There's a hurricane that's raging through my blood  
I can't find a way to calm the sea  
Maybe I'll find someday the waters aren't so rushed  
Right now they've got the best of me  
And oh, it's been a long, long time  
Since I had real peace of mind  
So I'm just going to sit right here  
In this old chair till this storm rolls by.  
  
Oh, maybe it's just the way I am  
Maybe I won't ever change  
So I'm just going to sit right here  
In this old chair and just soak up the rain.  
  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul  
Every time I think it's gone away  
Dark clouds gather, that old wind begins to blow  
The sun's going to shine someday I hope  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul, in my soul.
