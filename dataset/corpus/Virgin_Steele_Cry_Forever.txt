I should've known better than to look in your eyes  
'Cause that's what got me thinking of the love we had shared  
Your spell lives on forever- Oh, you captured my heart  
How could I forget you, or the love we had made  
Seems like only yesterday, when I held you in my arms  
And you would softly whisper: "I'll never leave"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cry forever- cry for the dreams we had  
Where did our love go, do you ever think of me?  
Cry forever- cry for the dreams we'll never share  
You made me love you, hen you turned your back upon me now  
Oh, I remember lying side by side  
Your heart gently beating, softly with mine  
Your face just like an angel, smiling up at me  
The hunger and the passion, when we'd set our love free  
Now the clock is slowly ticking in this empty room  
The images are haunting like a candle through the gloom  
Cry forever...  
I dreamed about you last night and the vision was so clear  
Of you and I together with no pain, lies or tears  
I woke up late this morning, with you still on my mind  
I could swear that you were with me, I was back there in time  
Pictures in the night, can't sustain the light of day  
I need someone to hold me, who'll never fade away  
Cry forever...  
Do you ever think of me.. at all?
