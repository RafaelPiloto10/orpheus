I know I'll never get over you  
So deep this feeling that I have for you  
Your eyes pierce through my heart  
Your smile tears me apart  
I knew it, it's so true  
I'll never get over you  
  
You touch me making my heart race  
So much was written on your face  
I knew when you arrived  
That no words could describe  
What your love made me do  
I'll never get over you  
  
Girl, you're so much heart and soul  
Girl, was a moonlit night you came into my life  
And now this feeling has grown  
And if you leave me alone I know  
I'll never get over you  
  
So hide the moments when I feel blue  
You warm the coldest feet  
Can cool me in the heart  
And all though love was new  
I'll never get over you  
My understanding grew  
But I'll never get over, never get over you
