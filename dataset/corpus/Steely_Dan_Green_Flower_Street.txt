Uptown  
It's murder out in the street  
Uptown  
It's murder out in the street  
That's where I found my mandarin plum  
That's where you'd be if you found one  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
Since may  
There's trouble most every night  
Where once we danced our sweet routine  
It reeks of wine and kerosene  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
There's a special place for lovers  
One we understand  
There where neon bends in daylight sky  
In that sunny room she soothes me  
Cools me with her fan  
We're drifting  
A thousand years roll by  
Lou chang  
Her brother he's burning with rage  
Lou chang  
Her brother he's burning with rage  
I'd like to know what's on his mind  
He says hey buddy you're not my kind  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street
