Slippin' and a-slidin', rockin' and a-riding  
Rollin' back to Lady Jane  
And can't you see the sun is shinin'  
Temperature's a-risin'  
Rood'n'doodee, what's your name?  
Seven-forty-seven, flying over heaven  
You could be a millionaire  
And you could be a Rockefeller  
Any kind of weather everybody, everywhere  
I wanna be your brother  
And I wanna be your friend  
I wanna be your brother  
Shake you by the hand  
Come on, everybody, gonna have a party  
Rock it all over the world  
Come on and shake it all over, over and over  
Down, down, come on and spread the word  
I wanna be your brother  
And I wanna be your friend  
I wanna be your brother  
And shake you by the hand  
I want the world to know  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
I want the world to know  
I wanna be your brother  
And I wanna be your friend  
I wanna be your brother  
Shake you by the hand  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
I want the world to know  
I wanna be your brother  
I want the world to know  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
I want the world to know  
I wanna be your brother  
I want the world to know
