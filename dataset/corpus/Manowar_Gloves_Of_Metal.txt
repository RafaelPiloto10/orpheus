Hear the pounding army of the night  
The call of metal summons us tonight.  
And gather we on this site  
To behold the power and the might.  
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night.  
  
Off with the lights, hear the screams  
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.  
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams  
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.  
  
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.  
We are together, we are all.  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
Hands high forever we'll be there.  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea.  
  
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.  
We are together, we are all.

Against the world we stand.  
Hands high forever we'll be there,  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight.  
  
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains  
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.  
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.  
Bound by metal we live the fight.  
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
With hands high forever we'll be there,  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight!
