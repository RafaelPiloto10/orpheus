In the justle and grind, workin' nine to nine  
Losin' my mind, watchin' Father Time  
It's the same ole same, this ball and chain  
With only one day to ease my pain  
'Cause Monday's just a bitch  
Tuesday's such a bother  
Wednesday's like watchin' dead flowers grow  
Thursday ain't for shit  
Friday's getting hotter  
But on Saturday night you know  
We let it rock  
And keep the drinks pourin'  
We let it roll  
Until the early morning  
We're underpaid, but we still give tanks and praise  
God bless Saturday  
They tell me I'm livin' the American dream  
Just workin' for the man  
But fifty two hours in a stamping plant  
Sometimes I don't understand  
'Cause Monday's just a bitch  
Tuesday's such a bother  
Wednesday's like watchin' dead flowers grow  
Thursday ain't for shit  
Friday's getting hotter  
But on Saturday night you know  
We let it rock  
And keep the drinks pourin'  
We let it roll  
Until the early morning  
We're underpaid, but we still give thanks and praise  
God bless Saturday
