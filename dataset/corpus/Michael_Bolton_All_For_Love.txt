Artist: Michael Bolton  
Song: All For Love  
  
The night becomes the dawn  
To prove that love goes on  
It's written in the stars and in my heart of hearts  
With you is where I still belong  
Through every page we turn  
Each lesson that we've learned  
Will finally set us free or bring us to our knees  
But love is right and never wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
We know we can say we gave it all  
We gave it all for love  
Each step of the way we gave our soul  
We gave it all for love. All for love  
  
In silent prayers I pray  
What words could never say  
To reach into your heart  
No matter where you are  
To promise we will find a way  
To walk the road we've known  
The road that leads us home  
A million dreams  
I've dreamed in every one I've seen  
The face of you and you alone  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
A lifetime goes by so fast  
For the secrets that remain  
Soon the future becomes the past  
When I hold you again.  
I'm gonna hold you forever  
  
In silent prayers I pray  
What words could never say  
To reach you through the dark  
To reach deep into your heart  
And promise we will find a way  
As night becomes the dawn  
To prove that love goes on  
Through every page we turn  
Each lesson that we've learned  
Will finally set us free or bring us to our knees  
But love is right and never wrong  
We give it all for love
