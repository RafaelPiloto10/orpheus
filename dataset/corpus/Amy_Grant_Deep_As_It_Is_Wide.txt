There's a place at the edge of the sky  
Where there's a love deep as it is wide  
The weak are strong, the hungry are all fed  
And there's a breeze from the angels flying overhead  
Oh yeah  
  
And there's a path, a glorious light  
That guides you up the mountainside  
And at the top, if you could you'd cry  
'Cause you see pure love for the very first time, mmm  
  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
And I hear, when you get to the river  
You look back for the very last time  
And when you cross, you get washed off forever  
Hurry up boy, eternity's on the other side, ohh  
  
Deep as it is wide, yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every nation, color and creed  
Like grace pouring out, far as the eye can see  
Singing praises up to a King  
'Cause He died, for a crown  
Deep as it is wide, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there and  
I believe there's a love  
I believe in a love, oh yeah  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide, oh yeah, oh  
  
There's a place at the edge of the sky  
Where there's a love, deep as it is wide
