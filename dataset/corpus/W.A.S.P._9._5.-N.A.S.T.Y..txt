One woman down my street is too hot for the average man  
Hard to handle, a fire in her eyes, wants the hot rocks right in her hand  
I know she's burning hot with love, a come on look and she ain't fooling  
And she knows just what it does  
She gave me a number to make me fell fine  
She said call me up baby it's gonna be  
  
9.5.- N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please  
N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please  
  
Ooh- no momma's baby, this child, she's a killer wrapped in high heel shoes  
Touch the skin, it burns like fire, I don't even care if I'm being used  
Threw me down and then she tore off my jeans  
She said come on baby I mean business  
I'm gonna show you what liberated means  
Do it to me baby, I'm losing my mind  
She said call me up honey, tonight I'm  
  
9.5.- N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please  
N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please  
  
Some bad habits are hard to break  
Like an earthquake coming, I gotta shake shake shake  
  
9.5.- N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please  
N.A.S.T.Y.  
You're everything I need  
Cause I want what you're giving  
I'm yours to do with what you please
