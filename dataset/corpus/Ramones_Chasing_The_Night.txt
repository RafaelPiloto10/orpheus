Standing here in front of the mirror  
Its gonna be all right tonight  
Feelin' hot yeah I'm on fire  
I'm never ever goin' to tire  
  
Tonight it's gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
  
Live my life as I choose  
I paid the price, paid my dues  
You know I need no alibi  
Daytime troubles fading  
Nights intoxicating  
Gonna have it all tonight  
That ain't no lie  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock all night  
Sleep all day  
It don't matter what they say  
Ain't never gonna change my ways  
And I won't be back till Monday  
  
Feelin' exasperating  
Excitement generating  
I'm never ever gonna tire  
City is overloading  
The circuits are exploding  
Ain't comin' down, no I'm too wired  
  
[Chorus]
