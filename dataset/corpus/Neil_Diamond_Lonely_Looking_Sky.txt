Lonely lookin sky  
Lonely sky, lonely looking sky  
And bein' lonely  
Makes you wonder why  
Makes you wonder why  
Lonely looking sky  
Lonely looking sky  
Lonely looking sky  
  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely night, lonely looking night  
And bein' lonely  
Never made it right  
Never made it right  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely looking night  
  
Sleep we sleep  
For we may dream  
While we may  
Dream we dream  
For we may wake  
One more day  
One more day  
  
Glory looking day  
Glory day, glory looking day  
And all it's glory  
Told a simple way  
Behold it if you may  
Glory looking day  
Glory looking day  
Lonely looking sky
