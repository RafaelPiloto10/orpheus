Hey girl, it's me, just called to tell you hi  
Call me when you get this  
Haven't talked lately, so hard to find the time  
Give the boys a big kiss  
Tell them that I miss them  
By the way, I miss you too  
I was thinking just today  
About how we used to play  
Barbie dolls and makeup  
Tea Parties, dress up  
I remember how we'd fight  
And make up and laugh all night  
Wish we were kids again  
My sister, my friend  
  
Oh yeah before I forget I met someone  
I think I really like him  
I was just wondering if I'm jumping the gun  
By going out on a limb  
And invite him home for Christmas  
To meet the family  
Seems like just yesterday,  
You brought home oh what's his name  
He had been drinking, what were you thinking?  
After dinner he passed out,  
We can laugh about it now  
'Cause we've learned a lot since then  
My sister, my friend  
  
Do you think you could come and  
See me sometime soon? (see me sometime soon)  
We could just hang out like we used to  
  
It's late and I should go,  
But I can't hang up the phone  
Until I tell you what I don't tell you enough  
Even though at times it seemed  
We were more like enemies  
I'd do it all again  
My sister, my friend  
  
Oh, my sister, my friend.
