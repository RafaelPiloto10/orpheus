Five miles outside of Vegas when we broke down  
Threw my keys inside that window  
And we never looked back  
  
We got all drunk and sloppy on a Greyhound bus  
We passed out cold so all them losers  
They were laughing at us  
  
I will never let them break your heart  
I will never let them break me  
  
We got lost in Phoenix  
Seemed like such a long time  
Seven months of living sweaty  
On those thin white lines  
  
I did some time  
For selling acid to the wrong guy  
Life just keeps on getting smaller  
And we never ask why  
  
Why there is no perfect place  
Yes I know this is true  
I'm just learning how to smile  
And that's not easy to do  
  
I know there will come a day  
When we can leave  
And just go running away  
(Oooh yeah)  
  
We were broke outside of Philly  
When the storms came  
I was working in New Jersey  
Hitching rides in the rain  
  
You was happy talking dirty  
At that phone sex place  
  
Life just keeps on getting weirder for us  
Everyday  
  
You say there is no perfect place  
I say I know this is true  
We are just learning how to smile  
And that's not easy to do  
  
We both live for the day  
When we can run away (hey...hey)  
Ah baby we can leave  
And run away (hey...hey)  
  
We can leave this place  
And run away (hey...hey)  
We can leave it all behind  
Just like we do everytime  
  
Yes we both live for the day  
When we can leave  
And just go running away  
  
No I will never let it break your heart  
No I will never let it break me  
  
Five miles outside of Vegas  
Five years down the line  
We got married in the desert  
In the sunshine  
  
I can handle all the hell  
That happens everyday  
When you smile and touch my face  
You make it all go away  
  
Yes I know there ain't no finish line  
I know this never ends  
We are learning how to fall  
And climb back up again  
  
I know there is nothing perfect  
I know there is nothing new  
We are just learning  
How to live together  
Me and you  
  
You know I live for the day  
When you say "baby let's just run away"  
  
Ah baby we can leave  
And run away (hey... hey)  
Yes we can leave this place  
And run away (hey...hey)  
  
Baby we can leave  
And run away (hey... hey)  
Yes we can leave this place  
And run away (hey... hey) [Repeat: x5]
