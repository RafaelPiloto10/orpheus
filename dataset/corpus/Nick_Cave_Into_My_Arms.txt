I don't believe in an interventionist god  
But I know, darling, that you do  
But if I did I would kneel down and ask him  
Not to intervene when it came to you  
Not to touch a hair on your head  
To leave you as you are  
And if he felt he had to direct you  
Then direct you into my arms  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms  
  
And I don't believe in the existence of angels  
But looking at you I wonder if that's true  
But if I did I would summon them together  
And ask them to watch over you  
To each burn a candle for you  
To make bright and clear your path  
And to walk, like christ, in grace and love  
And guide you into my arms  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms  
  
And I believe in love  
And I know that you do too  
And I believe in some kind of path  
That we can walk down, me and you  
So keep your candlew burning  
And make her journey bright and pure  
That she will keep returning  
Always and evermore  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms
