Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing  
"let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday  
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way

Yeah, rockin' around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday  
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way
