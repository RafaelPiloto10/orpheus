It was one of those great stories  
That you can't put down at night  
The hero knew what he had to do  
And he wasn't afraid to fight  
The villain goes to jail  
While the hero goes free  
I wish it were that simple for me  
  
And the reason that she loved him  
Was the reason I loved him too  
And he never wondered what was  
Right or wrong  
He just knew  
He just knew  
  
Shadow and shade mix together at dawn  
But by the time you catch them  
Simplicity's gone  
So we sort through the pieces  
My friends and I  
Searching through the darkness to find  
The breaks in the sky  
  
And the reason that she loved him  
Was the reason I loved him too  
And he never wondered what was  
Right or wrong  
He just knew  
He just knew  
  
And we wonder yes we wonder  
How do you make sense of this  
When the hero  
Kills the maiden  
With his kiss  
With his kiss  
  
Well it was one of those great stories  
That you can't put down at night  
The hero knew what he had to do  
And he wasn't afraid to fight  
The villain goes to jail  
While the hero goes free  
I wish it were that simple  
For me  
  
Were that simple for me
