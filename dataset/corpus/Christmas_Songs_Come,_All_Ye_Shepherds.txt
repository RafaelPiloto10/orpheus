Come, all ye shepherds, ye children of earth,  
Come ye, bring greetings to yon heavenly birth.  
For Christ the Lord to all men is given,  
To be our Savior sent down from heaven:  
Come, welcome Him!  
  
Hasten then, hasten to Bethlehem's stall,  
There to see heaven descend to us all.  
With holy feeling, there humbly kneeling,  
We will adore Him, bow down before Him,  
Worship the King.  
  
Angels and shepherds together we go  
Seeking the Savior from all earthly woe
