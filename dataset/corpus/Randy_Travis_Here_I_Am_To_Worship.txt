Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes and let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore you  
Hope for a life spent with you  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that you're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh, so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly you came to the earth you created  
All for love's sake became poor  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that you're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross
