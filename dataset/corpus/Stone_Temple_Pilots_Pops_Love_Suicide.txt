Can you figure out what I want  
Pull the trigger with a pop gun  
Mindless fools that aggravate it  
Pick at you in desperation  
  
Oh it's a love pop suicide  
Oh I'm in love pop suicide  
Oh I really don't know  
  
Pop life living it is so real  
Midwest farmers' kids are milkfed  
Breed and incubate what you see  
Ten years later here on t.v.  
  
Oh it's a love pop suicide  
Oh I'm in love pop suicide  
Oh I really don't know  
  
Father can't you love your woman  
Father can't you teach your children  
Long range love implosion short wicked  
Short wave mind explosion  
  
Oh I'm in love suicide  
About a pop star homicide
