I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side  
Never drop top forty cause I always rock be -sides  
G-rides with a hundred spokes to match  
We roll two deep...three freaks...four amps in the back  
  
I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang  
Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing  
I want to twang like Hang...rock like roll  
Got soul like Stevie when I'm under the sun and so  
  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
I never had a lot of money never made much sense  
Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent  
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed  
He's rockin' dickie's slippin lickin? honey?s steady  
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold  
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go  
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness  
  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
I see these people makin' money and it's funny to me  
Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me  
'Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more  
Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour  
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers  
  
Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror  
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt  
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt  
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my roap  
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because  
  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Some-some-some body's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
Feel this
