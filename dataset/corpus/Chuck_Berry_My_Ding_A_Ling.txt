My ding-a-ling-a-ling  
  
When I was a little biddy boy  
My grandma bought me a cute little toy  
Two silver bells on a string  
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling  
  
My ding-a-ling my ding-a-ling won't you play with my ding-a-ling  
My ding-a-ling my ding-a-ling won't you play with my ding-a-ling  
  
When I was little boy in grammar school  
Always went by the very best rule  
But every time the bell would ring  
You'd catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while climbing the garden wall,  
Slipped and fell had a very bad fall  
I fell so hard I heard birds sing,  
But I held on to my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers right at my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling  
  
Now this here song it ain't so bad  
Prettiest little song that you ever had  
And those of you who will not sing  
Must be playing with your on ding-a-ling
