Stand at the mirror and look at my face  
See all the changes I know somethings wrong  
But when I think back to the love that we had  
I look for escape 'cause I know that it's gone  
  
I always looked on the touch of our love  
As a soft stream running over me  
But I always knew there would be a way out  
But for you, not for me  
Just a felling  
  
Now all I see is the trace of a smile  
Memories forgotten a long time ago  
Never believed I could see you this way  
I don't know what changed you, I'll just never know  
  
I used to dream there was someone around  
Who was there just to watch over me  
Out in the crowds there was someone around  
Who was meant just for me  
  
Friends say "impossible"  
But I say it's got to be  
  
Just a feeling
