I knew all of this was coming  
Ain't that odd  
Some things come out of nothing  
As with god  
Not my intention to amuse  
Or confuse  
  
I've been down to the kitchen  
Played my part  
Mapped out all all contradictions  
Of the heart  
Then someone came and stole my shoes  
A situation I tried to diffuse  
  
Long way back clouds were forming  
If by choice  
Some things come as a warning  
Hear their voice  
I wish that I could change its hue  
Paint it blue  
But when I think what I could lose  
All other options disappear from view  
  
When I choose  
I choose you  
I choose you
