Sooner or later it's gonna get better  
Sooner or later I'm gonna get over her  
  
You know I can't go on like this  
It's just a matter time  
There'll come a day when I will wake up  
Without her on my mind  
  
Sooner or later it's gonna get better  
Sooner or later I'm gonna get over her  
  
They say that time will heal everything  
So I'm winding the clock  
And waiting for that glorious moment  
When my heartache will stop  
  
She let me go  
It took me by surprise  
I feel out of place  
Without her by my side  
  
Sooner or later it's gonna get better  
Sooner or later I'm gonna get over her  
Sooner or later  
Sooner or later  
Sooner or later
