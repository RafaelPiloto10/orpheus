Now I'm a sad one, and she was a bad one  
A mean, mean girl  
I never had one as greedy as that one  
A mean, mean girl  
  
Mean, mean, mean, mean girl  
I guess she's not the kind that I was looking for  
Mean, mean, mean, mean girl  
She said I was the first but there were many more  
  
She was a big one, a met-at-a-gig once  
A mean, mean girl  
I felt a sick one, she was a quick one  
A mean, mean girl  
  
Mean, mean, mean, mean girl  
I guess she's not the kind that I was looking for  
Mean, mean, mean, mean girl  
She said I was the first but there were many more
