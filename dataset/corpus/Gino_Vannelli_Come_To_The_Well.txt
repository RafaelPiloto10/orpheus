Come to the well she said  
Come eat my bread  
Come drink the water of life  
Enter my valley deep  
Let the angels weep  
Rejoice and touch the good earth tonight  
And there was gingham and silk  
Sage, honey and milk  
Sweetmeats, spirits and wine  
She bathed us in sweet balms of rose  
Lit candles of clove  
And lay her glisting body on mine  
We stayed locked in love  
In leaves of green and gold  
She touched, I trembled, we kissed  
I poured the contents of my aching heart and soul  
Soon she woke up with the sun  
Filled with seeds of worlds to come  
Come to the well she said  
Come and eat my bread  
Come and drink the water of life
