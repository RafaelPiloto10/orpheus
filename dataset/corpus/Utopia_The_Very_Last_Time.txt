Sometimes I wonder if I'm still alive  
How much abuse can someone stand and survive  
How long I've waited for this day to arrive  
When I won't be a fool no more  
Nobody knows how you push me around  
Nobody sees how you treat me like I'm your clown  
I never made a sound  
It's the very last time you will get on my case  
It's the very last time 'cause  
I won't be a fool no more  
It's the very last time you will step on my face  
It's the very last time 'cause  
I won't be a fool no more  
I still remember the look in your eyes  
Just a reflection of the things you despise  
But sooner or later I've got to get wise  
And I won't be a fool no more  
Nobody sees how you treat me like dirt  
Nobody knows just how badly a man can hurt  
You've got a lesson to learn  
I can still feel the sting of your words  
But I won't cry no matter how much it hurts  
My head may go crazy, my heart it may burst  
But I won't be a fool no more  
No I won't be a fool no more
