Oh, baby child...  
  
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight  
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon  
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room  
  
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help  
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else  
They say a secret is something you tell one other person  
So I'm telling you, child  
  
A man will beg  
A man will crawl  
On the sheer face of love  
Like a fly on a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest  
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success  
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief  
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief  
  
Over love...  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Love...we shine like a  
Burning star  
We're falling from the sky  
Tonight  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Oh, yeah!  
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie  
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change  
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
