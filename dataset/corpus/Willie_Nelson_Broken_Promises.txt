I made myself a promise, the day you put me down,  
That I wouldn't see you if you came around.  
But here you are, within my arms, the way you used to be.  
And I broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
They told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go:  
I made myself a promise that I'd only say hello.  
I knew you'd only hurt me, but it's such sweet misery,  
So I broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,  
And I know who that someone's bound to be.  
And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,  
And broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,

And broke the promise that I made to me.
