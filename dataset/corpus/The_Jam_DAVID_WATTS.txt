Am a dull and simple lad  
Cannot tell water from champagne  
And I have never met the Queen  
And I wish I could have all he has got  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
And when I lie on my pillow at night  
I dream I could fight like David Watts  
And lead the school team to victory  
Take my exams and pass the lot  
  
He is the head boy at the school  
He is the captain of the team  
His is so gay and fancy free  
And I wish I could have all the money he's got  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
And all the girls in the neighborhood  
Try to go out with David Watts  
The try their best but can't succeed  
For he is of pure and noble creed
