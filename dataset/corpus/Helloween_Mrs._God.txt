Mrs. God, am I right  
That's your real address  
This time, it's you  
Ready to confess  
Free the masculine world  
Cancel their humility  
  
Mrs God, can it be  
Can You be the light  
One dressed to kill  
  
Walk on, how you bite  
This will state and explain  
Why men are sometimes stumbling  
  
Mrs God, are You there  
Laughing at us is not fair  
Mrs God can You see  
All the shit You've done to me  
  
Mrs. God, may I say  
It's nothing of my kind  
We're so deceived  
You'd better left us blind  
  
Mrs God, we are cool  
Take it with the smile  
But don't be cruel  
That's heavy to defy  
In some hundred years  
God has always had the tears
