(feat. Ronnie Dunn)  
  
[Reba:]  
La's a fast horse daddy  
Everybody rides  
I'm sorry I haven't called home lately  
Out here time flies  
I met a boy a few weeks back  
He plays in a band  
He's a whole lot like you daddy you're gonna like him  
He's a good man  
At times lonley sneaks up on me  
But I'm getting by  
Yeah I know what you've always told me  
Cow girls don't cry  
  
[Chorus:]  
But does the wind still blow in oklahoma  
Out here the hollywood stars sure shine bright  
It's such a long way from home here in California  
Missin you and that blue wide open sky  
  
[Ronnie:]  
Out here it's all freeway fast cars  
Cold concrete  
You won't believe all the crazy people  
Bally girls sun sets free  
I met a girl you're gonna like her mama  
She has your hair  
Red as the telecross sunset  
Seems like an angel I swear  
I can't say I don't get lonsome  
But I'm alright  
Cow boys kinda go with homesick  
Like blue moons and whipperwill nights  
  
[Chorus:]
