Last night I dreamed an angel came he took my hand he called my name  
He bade me look the other way I saw a man I heard him say  
He said if I'd be lifted up I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then I saw the nail scared hands that bled for me  
  
(I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there)  
My life my heart I gave my soul was in his care  
  
When I awoke my heart beat sore and in the dark I saw a glow  
It was no dream he turned my way again I heard my Saviour say  
He said if I'd be lifted up...
