He was a man of miracles  
  
Fighting the solar windstorm  
A winged horse guides his way  
Oracle of the ancient midnight  
Calls forth everlasting pain  
  
And I know, yes I know  
He was a man of miracles  
Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights  
Of the northern lights  
  
Sorcerer of the dark moon  
Who dare incur his rage?  
First child of the scorpion  
Prophet of the crystal age  
  
And I know, yes I know  
He was a man of miracles  
Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights  
Of the northern lights  
  
He was a man of miracles
