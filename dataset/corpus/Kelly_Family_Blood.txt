They drill them to the ground,  
They take away their rights,  
They're making martyrs out of little children.  
Give a kid a gun, take away her Mum,  
They teach them how to kill when they hunger.  
Kill that man, kill that girl, kill anyone you want today.  
Blood is on the ground, they're shooting all around,  
They got an army bigger than D-day.  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.  
  
We're living in a time where loving is so hard,  
I can't even help my little brother,  
But silence is a crime when someone needs your help,  
God have mercy on me today.  
War is money, war is power,  
Blood is the river of the century.  
Leave them now, let them go,  
Set all the children free!  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.  
  
This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society  
Who are being deprived of their basis rights,  
The right to a peaceful home,  
The right to an education,  
The right to innocence,  
The right to health and food,  
To love and to be loved,  
The right to a joyful youth.  
And my heart goes out especially to my nephews  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.
