It's been a long time, baby, how've you been,  
But it sure feels good to see you again, my friend.  
I still remember just like yesterdays  
Though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away  
And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
I still remember when you didn't know my name.  
We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,  
God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways  
  
But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song  
I hope that you say nothing's changed  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Now dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever.
