[Interlude]  
Thank you. You're welcome  
Huh, all right  
(Where to sir?)  
Take us home [?]  
Wait a minute, I didn't say I was coming home with you  
Well I mean, you didn't necessarily say you wasn't  
Stop tryna be cute  
I'm just saying. I want you, it's clear that you want me  
Conceded  
Confident, there's a difference. And to deny our impulses is to deny the very
thing that makes us human  
Spare me the game. It's clear that you want it, the question is, do you
deserve it?  
I can show you so much better than I can tell you, that is if I let you  
Let you what?  
Take you there...
