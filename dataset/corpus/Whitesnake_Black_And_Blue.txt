You never call me, babe,  
Until your man is gone,  
I know it's you  
When I pick up the telephone  
  
You ask me how I am  
And if I'm doing well,  
When all you want from me  
Is just to ring your bell  
  
Take your time, we can do some lines,  
'Cause it's alright  
We can feel fine drinking midnight wine,  
'Cause it's alright  
  
Black and blue, black and blue,  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
  
You got the key to love  
Dressed in your innocent smile,  
You know you touched me baby,  
So won't you stay for a while  
  
And take your time, we can do some lines,  
'Cause it's alright  
We can feel fine drinking midnight wine,  
'Cause it's alright  
  
Black and blue, black and blue,  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
Black and blue, black and blue,  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
  
Take your time, we can do some lines,  
'Cause it's alright  
We can feel fine drinking midnight wine,  
'Cause it's alright  
  
Black and blue, black and blue,  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
Black and blue, black and blue,  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
I said come over here, baby,  
And love me till I'm black and blue  
  
Black and blue
