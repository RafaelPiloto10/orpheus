Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
Did you ever in good time think  
my life had gone amiss?  
Now I feel I've been unfair  
'cause I catch you hanging there.  
Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
My damnedest try to make it work,  
I knew it never would.  
Now there's nothin' wrong with you,  
and there's nothing you could ever do.  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory.  
I'm sorry, there's another face  
one that's close to me.  
You know 'bout what I learned  
and there's no stone left unturned.  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory. (Sigh)
