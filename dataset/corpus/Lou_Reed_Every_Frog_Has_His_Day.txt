[King:]  
Oh mellifluous dwarf  
Prince of all the jesters  
Funny little thing you are  
Make me laugh  
As God's voluminous star  
[Hop Frog:]  
Gracious majesty  
Today is not made for laughter day  
This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets  
Then comic ruin or suicidal jests  
[King:]  
I'll be the judge of that thank you  
Make me laugh le petite cur  
Drink some wine  
Lest you foul sweet time  
[Hop Frog:]  
Drink upsets me  
Please your liege  
This would mark the death me  
[King:]  
I said drink you scabrous whore  
Are you deaf as well as short?  
[Tripitena:]  
Kingdom's Sire  
Big as you are  
Save such  
Bile for larger foes  
[King:]  
Make me laugh  
'Fore I stretch your neck like a giraffe
