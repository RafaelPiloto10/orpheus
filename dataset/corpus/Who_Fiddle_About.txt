Uncle Ernie:  
  
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie  
I'm glad you won't see or hear me  
As I fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about !  
  
Your mother left me here to mind you  
Now I'm doing what I want to  
Fiddling about  
Fiddling about  
Fiddle about!  
  
Down with the bedclothes  
Up with the nightshirt!  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about !  
  
You won't shout as I fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about !  
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.
