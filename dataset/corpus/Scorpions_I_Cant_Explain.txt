I got a feeling inside  
It's a certain kind  
I feel hot and cold  
Deep down in my soul  
  
I said I can't explain  
I'm feeling good enough baby  
  
I'm dizzy in my head  
And I'm feeling blue  
Things you say but maybe they're true  
Getting funny dreams again and again  
I know what it means but  
  
I can't explain  
I think it's love  
I'm trying to say to you  
When I feel blue  
But I can't explain (can't explain)  
Just hear what I'm saying baby (can't explain)  
  
I'm dizzy in the head  
And I'm feeling bad  
Things you say got me real mad  
Getting funny dreams again and again  
I know what it means but  
  
I can't explain  
I think it's love  
I'm trying to say to you  
When I feel blue  
But I can't explain (can't explain)  
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain)  
  
I'm dizzy in the head  
And I'm feeling bad  
Things you say got me real mad  
Getting funny dreams again and again  
I know what it means but  
  
I can't explain  
I think it's love  
I'm trying to say to you  
When I feel blue  
But I can't explain (can't explain)  
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain)  
  
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)  
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)  
She drive me out of my mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mind (can't explain)  
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)  
You drive me out of my mind (can't explain)  
  
Oh yeah, I can't explain  
I can't explain baby
