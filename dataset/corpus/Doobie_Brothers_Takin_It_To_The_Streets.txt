You don't know me but I'm your brother  
I was raised here in this living Hell  
You don't know my kind in your world  
Fairly soon, the time will tell  
You, telling me the things you're gonna do for me  
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Take this message to my brother  
You will find him everywhere  
Wherever people live together  
Tied in poverty's despair  
You, telling me the things you're gonna do for me  
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the  
You, telling me the things you're gonna do for me  
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets  
Takin' it to the streets
