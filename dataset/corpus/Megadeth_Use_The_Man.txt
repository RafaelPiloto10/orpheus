I heard somebody fixed today  
There was no last goodbyes to say  
His will to live ran out  
I heard somebody turned to dust  
Looking back at what he left  
A list of plans and photographs  
Songs that never will be sung  
These are the things he won't get done  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands  
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
Just one shot to say goodbye  
One last taste to mourn and cry  
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim  
Just one shot to do him in  
He hangs his head and wonders why  
Why the monkey only lies  
But pay the pauper, he did choose  
He hung his head inside the noose  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands  
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
Cryptic writings on the wall, the beginning of the end  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
