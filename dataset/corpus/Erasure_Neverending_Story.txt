Turn around, look at what you see,  
in her face, the mirror of your dreams  
Make believe I'm everywhere, hidden in the lines  
written on the pages is the answer to a neverending story, neverending story.  
  
Reach the stars, fly a fantasy.  
dream a dream, and what you see will be.  
Lives that keep their secrets, will unfold behind the clouds.  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story.  
neverending story  
story  
neverending story  
  
Go! Show no fear, for she may fade away.  
In your hand, the birth of the new day.  
Lives that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds.  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story.  
Neverending story  
Neverending story  
Neverending story
