I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
  
Exhibition is the name  
Voyeurism is the game  
Stereoscopic is the show  
Viewing time makes it grow  
  
I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
  
My facade is just a fake  
Shock, horror, no escape  
Sensationalism for the feed  
Caricatures are what you breed  
Breed, breed, breed, breed  
  
I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I don't care  
I like to make people stare  
  
Anti-art was the start  
Establishments like a laugh  
Yes we're very entertaining  
Overtones can be betraying
