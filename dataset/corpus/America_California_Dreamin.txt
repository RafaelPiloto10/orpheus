All the leaves are brown  
And the sky is gray  
I went for a walk  
On a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm  
If I was in L.A.  
California dreamin'  
On such a winter's day  
I stopped into a church  
(Stopped into a church)  
I passed along the way  
(Passed along the way)  
You know, I got down on my knees  
(Got down on my knees)  
And I pretend to pray  
(I pretend to pray)  
Oh, the preacher likes the cold  
(Preacher likes the cold)  
He knows I'm gonna stay  
(Knows I'm gonna stay)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
All the leaves are brown  
(The leaves are brown)  
And the sky is gray  
(And the sky is gray)  
I went for a walk  
(I went for a walk)  
On a winter's day  
(On a winter's day)  
If I didn't tell her  
(If I didn't tell her)  
I could leave today  
(I could leave today)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day
