Standin' on the outside  
Lookin' in  
You know it's been a long time,  
Don't know where to begin  
So much I want to say,  
so much I want to do,  
Friends are tellin' me  
It's time that you broke through.  
  
I've been through the hard times  
Of searchin' souls,  
You know it's been a hard climb  
From rock and roll.  
Now I feel a need in me,  
so hard to explain,  
Now I've seen the joy and light,  
And I want to remain.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I kicked away them blues.  
  
All the phony faces  
Stand in line.  
All the back-slappers  
Know my name this time.  
Now that I've turned the lock,  
now that I've opened the door,  
I won't be on the outside,  
not anymore, not any more.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I pushed away them blues.  
  
Now that I've turned the lock,  
now that I've opened the door,  
I won't be on the outside, not anymore.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just wanna sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I kicked away them blues.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
Standin' on the inside,  
I kicked, kicked, kicked it,  
Standin' on the inside,  
Standin' on the inside,  
I kicked, kicked
