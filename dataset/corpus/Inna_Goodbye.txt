No one cares  
Nobody's wrong,  
No one see  
I'm not so strong.  
Everytime I hope I dreaming...  
(I'm missing you...)  
  
I'm touching you  
But you can't feel,  
I'm scream at you  
But you can't hear.  
I just need to be around you...  
(I'm lost without you...)  
  
You are so special,  
So give me so passion.  
I need to tell you,  
I'm watching you.  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...  
  
I am crying  
For so long,  
I can't breath  
Without your love.  
It's so wrong that I'm without you...  
(I'm missing you...)  
  
I'm touching you  
But you can't feel,  
I'm scream at you  
But you can't hear.  
I just need to be around you...  
(I'm lost without you...)  
  
You are so special,  
So give me so passion.  
I need to tell you,  
I'm watching you.  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...  
  
(Haaaaa...)  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...  
  
Goodbye, you all,  
Goodbye, my friends,  
So goodbye, my baby.  
You, my baby...  
You, my baby...
