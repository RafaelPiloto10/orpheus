Dustland fairytale beginning  
Just another white trash  
County kiss  
Sixty one  
Long brown hair and foolish eyes  
He looks just like you want him to  
Some kind of slick chrome American prince  
A blue jean serenade  
And Moon River what'd you do to me  
And I don't believe you  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the minute that I turn away  
I got my money on a pond tonight  
  
Change came in disguised of revelation  
Set his soul on fire  
She said she'd always knew he'd come around  
And the decades disappear like sinking  
Ships we persevere god gives us hope  
But we still fear  
When we don't know  
The mind is poison castle in the sky  
Sit stranded vandalized  
The draw bridge is closing  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the ending were they turned the page  
I threw my money and I ran away  
Straight to the Valley of the great divide  
  
And were the dreams roll high  
And were the wind don't blow  
Out here the good girls die  
And the sky won't snow  
Out here the bird don't sing  
Out here the field don't grow  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the good girls die  
  
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep  
Its such a bitter form of refuge  
Ah don't you know the kingdoms under siege  
And everybody needs you  
Is there still magic in the midnight sun  
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one  
In the of the cadence in the young mans eyes  
And were the dreams roll high
