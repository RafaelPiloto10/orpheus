Ain't got no hope  
Got no idea  
What to do  
Or why I'm here  
Wanna get my face  
On your TV  
I wanna be heard  
I want to be seen  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't got nothin'  
No  
Nothing  
Nothin' to show  
Make me a c-lebrity  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
(I wanna be on your screen)  
Then you can see  
I'm a c-lebrity  
  
I wanna get my features  
In magazines  
See this creature on every street  
On every screen  
Write my life story  
Before I'm twenty one  
I got to tell the world  
They may say I'm dumb but er  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
(I wanna be on your screen)  
Then you can see  
I'm a c-lebrity  
  
I wanna be a star  
In a Broadway musical  
They're gonna love me  
I can't sing or dance at all  
Some may say I'm lackadaisical  
And if I was real good  
I'd stand no chance at all  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
(Yeah I wanna be on your screen)  
Then you can see  
I'm a c-lebrity  
Then you can say  
You knew me one day  
Then you will see  
I'm a c-lebrity  
  
C c-lebrity  
Wanna be a c c c-lebrity  
Make my dream come true  
C c-lebrity  
Wanna be a c c c c-lebrity  
I wanna be heard  
I want to be seen  
On every TV screen
