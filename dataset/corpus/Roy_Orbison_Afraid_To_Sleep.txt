The night is still the wind is chilled  
I hear the rain falling on my window pane  
Can't close my eyes, afraid to sleep  
Cause when I do I would only dream of you  
I'm trying to forget that we ever met  
But how can I forget and dream of you?  
Afraid to sleep because I'd dream of you  
Afraid to sleep because I'd wake up feeling blue  
If I stay awake forever,we'd never be together  
So I'll close my eyes and go ahead and dream  
Sweet dreams  
Sweet dreams  
Sweer dreams....
