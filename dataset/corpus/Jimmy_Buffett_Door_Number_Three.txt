Oh I took a wrong turn, it was the right turn  
My turn to have me a ball  
Boys at the shop told me just where to stop  
If I wanted to play for it all  
I didn't know I'd find her on daytime TV  
My whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
I chose my apparel, wore a beer barrel  
And they rolled me to the very first row  
I held a big sign that said "Kiss me I'm a baker,  
and Monty I sure need the dough!"  
Then I grabbed that sucker by the throat  
Until he called on me  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
And I don't want what Jay's got on his table  
Or the box Carol Merrill points to on the floor  
No, I'll hold out just as long as I am able  
Until I can unlock that lucky door  
Well, she's no big deal to most folks  
But she's everything to me  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
Oh Monty, Monty, Monty, I am walking down your hall  
God be, I lost my seat but I'm not a man to crawl  
No I didn't get rich you son of a bitch  
I'll be back just wait and see  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
Yes my whole world lies waiting behind door number three
