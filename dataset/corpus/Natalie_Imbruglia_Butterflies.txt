Swallow purple terror candy  
Don't forget to breathe  
Sickened by the wanting  
And drowning from the need  
This dichromatic vision  
Of one who does not care  
To sipping cocktail sedatives  
Two months to hide somewhere  
  
Butterflies, butterflies  
Cut the stomach out and hand it over  
Butterflies, butterflies  
My heart will be the bridge that you walk over  
  
The wolf has caught the chicken  
And now I feel unsteady  
Emotions on the blink again  
So kick me when you're ready  
Here lies a violet coffin  
The death of my control  
Along with all my skeletons  
They put them in the hole  
  
Butterflies, butterflies  
Cut the stomach out and hand it over  
Butterflies, butterflies  
My heart will be the bridge that you walk over  
  
Sickened by the notion  
I give myself again  
Choking on the bullet, the gun that's found a friend  
So raise your glass to sorrow  
And drink to all the pain  
Tie a silver ribbon around  
The pieces that remain  
  
Butterflies, butterflies  
Cut the stomach out and hand it over  
Butterflies, butterflies  
My heart will be the bridge that you walk over
