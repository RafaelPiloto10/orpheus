We all want peace we don't want misery  
So many of us won't let us be these things  
But we only are confused  
We feel stronger as we grow older  
But still we feel bemused  
  
Always asking questions  
We're always asking questions  
  
And the temptation is to just step back  
Well we give what we lack  
We will always be asking questions  
Why rich?  
Why poor?  
  
Always asking questions  
We're always asking questions  
  
Why this?  
Why that?  
We're always asking questions  
Why this?  
Why that?  
Always asking  
Don't stop asking  
  
Don't stop asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
In answer to this question is just shut up  
You don't know  
I don't know  
Nobody knows  
This is an answer to every question  
This is a place to begin  
  
Always asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
Why this?  
Why that?  
Why this?  
Why that?  
  
Always asking questions  
(why this why that?)  
Always asking questions  
(why this why that?)  
Always asking questions  
(why this why that?)
