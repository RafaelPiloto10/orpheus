I wake up in the morning  
And I look out at the sun  
Then I think I'll get up, go out a while  
And I get out on the run.  
Then I say, "My boy, you got to slow down  
And have yourself some fun."  
So I lay around and I smoke a while  
And I never get nothing done.  
  
I don't care, my needs are few,  
What in the world am I gonna do  
With a million dollars from I don't know who  
When in the world, will I get through  
With living in such great expectations  
With loving, some call it infatuation.  
  
I go outside and I walk a while  
Singing in the street.  
I blow a kiss, I give a smile  
To every one I meet.  
I buy myself a beer or two  
Just to leave my stone behind.  
Sometimes I get so drunk  
I can sing just like a child, yeah.  
Ooh, ooh.  
  
I get drunk and I laugh a lot,  
There's something that I hear.  
My brain gets loose, my soul gets hot,  
The music hits my ears.  
I hear the music...  
Lord, it sounds so sweet!  
  
Music's hot and I don't mind  
If I dance a step or two.  
I do a twitch, unwind my spine  
I set my eyes on you.  
I watch you move, you move so fine,  
So fine I never knew  
Making love while dancing  
Is an easy thing to do.  
  
Yes, it's easy It ain't hard!  
Yes, yes it's easy It ain't hard!  
Oh, oh, it's easy Oh no, no, no!  
Oh, it's easy Come on...
