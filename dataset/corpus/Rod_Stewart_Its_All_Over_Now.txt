Baby used to stay out all night long  
She made me cry  
You know she done me wrong  
She held my eyes open and that's no lie  
  
Tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Listen  
She used to run around with every single man in town  
Spent all my money playing her fast game  
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried  
  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Ain't no lie  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Well I used to wake the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I got worried she'd ease my aching head  
But now she's here and there with every single man in town  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
But then I used to love her but it's all  
But then I used to love her but you know  
But you know it's all over now  
But then I used to love her but you know it's all over now
