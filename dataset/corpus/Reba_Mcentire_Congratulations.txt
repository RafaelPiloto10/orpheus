Congratulations  
You made a fool out of me  
I hope you're happy  
So now just let me be  
  
I might be slow to lovers  
But I catch on eventually  
Congratulations  
You made a fool out of me  
  
Anticipation  
You kept me waiting in line  
Your situation did not allow you time  
So I'd sit home alone  
Pretending someday you'd be mine  
Congratulations  
You made a fool of me this time  
  
Then he played it smart  
You stole my heart  
And tore my world apart  
Guess you always knew  
I'd be the perfect fool  
Congratulations baby  
You win, I lose  
  
Imagination  
The way I dreamed it could be  
Ooo, the sweetest sensation  
Of how you made love to me  
But now the vision's gone  
It's time to face reality  
Congratulations  
You made a fool out of me  
Congratulations  
You made a fool out of me
