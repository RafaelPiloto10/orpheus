Way down in Columbus Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee  
Way down in Columbus Stockade friends have turned their backs on me  
Go on and leave me if you wish to never let me cross your mind  
In your heart you love another leave me little darlin' I don't mind  
Way down in Columbus Georgia...  
[ fiddle - guitar ]  
Way down in Columbus Georgia...  
Leave me little darlin' I don't mind leave me little darlin' I don't mind
