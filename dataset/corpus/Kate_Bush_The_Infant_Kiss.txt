Say good night-night  
I tuck him in tight.  
But things are not right.  
What is this? An infant kiss  
That sends my body tingling?  
I've never fallen for  
A little boy before.  
No control.  
  
Just a kid and just at school.  
Back home they'd call me dirty.  
His little hand is on my heart.  
He's got me where it hurts me.  
Knock, knock. Who's there in this baby?  
  
You know how to work me.  
All my barriers are going.  
It's starting to show.  
Let go. Let go. Let go.  
I cannot sit and let  
Something happen I'll regret.  
Ooh, he scares me!  
  
There's a man behind those eyes.  
I catch him when I'm bending.  
Ooh, how he frightens me  
When they whisper privately.  
("Don't Let Go!")  
  
Windy-wailey blows me.  
Words of caress on their lips  
That speak of adult love.  
I want to smack but I hold back.  
I only want to touch.  
  
But I must stay and find a way  
To stop before it gets too much!  
All my barriers are going.  
It's starting to show.  
Let go. Let go. Let go.  
(Don't let go!)
