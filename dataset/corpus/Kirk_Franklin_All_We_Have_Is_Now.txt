Finally I see what's right in front of me, the chance to be free  
From all the troubles that this life could bring if only we would sing...  
I've been living for tomorrow so long I can't recall the feeling I had when I
was with you  
  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I missed the reason why I'm here.  
Everything is meaningless except a life that is confident in you.  
That you would walk beside me in all the things I see and in all I do.  
It's because of you.  
  
No more living for tomorrow.  
Today's the day that I will be the one to change the world.  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I know the reason I am here.

Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I know the reason for today. I'm living for today.
