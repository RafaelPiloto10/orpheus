One, you come to my room for a little game  
Two you, I'll do very erotic things  
  
I wanna make love, babe, very slowly  
Three times in a row, all night I'll go  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Body next to mine  
Love dance syncopated time  
Sugar rush keeps me high  
Sweet kiss on my thigh  
I wanna make love, baby, very badly  
Feels good in the air every time you're here  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating  
Love, I am saving for you  
Hear what I'm saying  
You I am craving  
Love is here waiting for you  
All day you're staying  
Please no delaying  
Patiently waiting for you  
Don't keep me waiting  
No time for playing  
Sitting here waiting for you  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Come one over  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me feva
