You shot your mouth off like a kid  
Who's scared to have a heart  
Your loosing grip of what really matters  
Cause you don't know where to start  
You wake up in the morning  
With a starfuck for a friend  
The things you do are so in tune  
With what you said you hate  
What's giving you the will to live  
Is it looking for revenge  
The only laugh that you've got left  
Is hiding from the pain  
What must have happened to your soul  
Is skinning you alive  
The thing you fear most is love  
And that's buried deep inside  
So deep inside  
  
Don't loose your head  
Cause I can't do the time  
Don't loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
The heart your building out of rock  
Is turning into sand  
Cause you never took the time to think  
What it means to be a man  
You act like you got the answer  
When the question's never asked  
I've been to where your coming from  
But the postcards weren't so bad  
The knife I carry has been sharpened  
On the mouths that won't keep shut  
I'll stab at you in the darkness  
Cause I'm trying to she'd some light  
Your point of view is so meaningless  
If you ever had one at all  
All you seem to care about  
Is who's gonna take the fall  
  
Who's gonna take the fall for you  
  
Don't loose your head  
Now I can't do the time for you  
Don't loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Don't loose your head  
Cause I can't do the time  
Don't loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Don't loose your head  
If you can't do the time  
Don't loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Don't loose your head  
You can't pay the price  
Don't loose your head  
You know I can't do the time
