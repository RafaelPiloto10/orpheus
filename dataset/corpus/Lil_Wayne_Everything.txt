I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father  
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions  
  
What it be like up there baby boy,  
Aye this here ya son hollerin' at ya  
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya  
But I know you watchin', peepin down on how I'm livin'  
Aye, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin'  
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit  
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk  
Say, I'll never forget the time  
That you caught me smokin' herb in the house  
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out  
But you just talked it over with my mom  
And got it situated in due time  
Told me get the paper instead of high  
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog  
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog  
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me  
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me  
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin  
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know  
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
  
I know you see my daughter growin' up and bad as ever  
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her  
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman  
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'  
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child  
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile  
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it  
But I know they love it way more than they hate it  
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these  
Bitches,  
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'  
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective  
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection  
And you see I left school behind and chose C-M-B  
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough  
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely  
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you  
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you  
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes  
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog  
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog  
So I live my life in dedication of you dog  
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within  
Make me want to grab that gun and burst again  
But I know they got a reason why I'm here  
And I know they got a reason why you gone  
And therefore, I'm succeedin' on my own  
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart  
I can't forget you kept it real from the start  
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me  
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me  
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said "they's my peoples"  
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you  
  
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know  
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
  
I know I can't be close to you (dog)  
I know you watching over me dog  
But the shit's that it hurt and burn deep  
Its alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
Rabbit, nigga, its your son  
I'm down in your hole and your down  
You see Cita straight, mom straight  
Your mom straight, I mean everything going right  
B and Slim nigga, is the realist niggas I ever met dog  
And plus now I'm on some squad shit  
My niggas, they keep it real with me  
I keep it real with them  
My little girl growning beautiful as ever man  
You need to see her dog, she bad though man  
Anyway dog, aight holla!
