Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack  
But that was all he missed and he aint coming back  
  
At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car he made a stop  
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top  
  
Next stop Chi-town Lido put the money down, let it roll  
He says one more job oughta get it  
One last shot before we quit  
One for the road  
  
Lido whoa-ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waiting for another go  
Lido whoa-ooo  
He says one more job oughta get it  
One last shot before we quit  
One more for the road  
  
Lido been running, having great big fun, till he got the note  
Saying tow the line or blow it and that was all she wrote  
Hed be making like a V line heading for the borderline, going for broke  
Saying one more hand oughta do it  
This job, aint nothing to it  
One for the road  
Lido whoa- ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waiting for another go  
Lido whoa-ooo  
One more job oughta get it  
One last shot till we quit it  
One more for the road  
  
Lido whoa-ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waitin for another go  
Lido whoaa-ooo
