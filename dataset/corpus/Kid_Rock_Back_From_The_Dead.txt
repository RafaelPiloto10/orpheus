Back from the dead second L.P. here we go  
Comin at ya from the R.O.M.E.O.  
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys  
Hat turned back in some Airwalk jimmys  
  
Never slackin hoes I be mackin  
Not wacked I don't try to act black when  
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts  
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt  
  
Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone  
Hit bound from the Mo-town allen  
Fuck a 40 I drink it by the gallon  
I started out in Mount Clemens as a D.J.  
  
Park parties gettin drunk on Sunday  
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip shit up  
An now I've toured this nation  
Pimp of the nation  
  
Pullin hoes  
Rock the set in each city then step  
Me, Blackman and Funk Daddy Def Stef  
Bitches, they think I'm sexist  
  
But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast  
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries  
And gimme a plate of that pussy on the side  
Triple x on the set showin no class  
  
Just a foul mouthed little fuckin smart ass  
No fool I went 2 high school dumb ass  
Smoked dope and I flunked every class  
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash  
  
Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed  
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed  
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin grass  
Now I reside on the eastside lovin it  
  
Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it  
Flex, sex, run of the next  
Flippin and trippin and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2  
Front an get around 2 the  
  
2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme  
I'm shakin and takin and breakin I rip the mic like  
Every time fuck I don't eat no manwich  
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich  
  
Somebody said I'm the best in the Mo-town  
But this town ain't shit but a ghost town  
Who ever said it they lied they fessed  
Bitch I'm the best in the mother fuckin midwest  
  
Want to be heard when I rap so I yell it  
Sport a Tigers cap like my man Tom Selleck  
One bad bitch I smoke hash from a stick  
Got more cash than fuckin White Boy Rick  
  
My first LP wasn't pushed for shit  
So Jive Records yo, go and suck a fat dick  
'cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw  
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like Hee Haw  
  
Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it  
That's how we do it when we roll down Gratiot  
In my Grand Marquis I pimp to the beat  
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat
