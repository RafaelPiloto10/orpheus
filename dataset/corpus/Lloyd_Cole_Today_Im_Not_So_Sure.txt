Didn't I promise always to  
Shelter and protect you  
Didn't I answer - Yes I do  
Well, today I'm not so sure  
Didn't the stars shine awful bright then  
Didn't I look into your eyes and  
Didn't I swear I'd always be there  
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Today I'm not so sure  
Today I'm not so sure  
Wasn't the world much younger then  
Isn't the word indifferent  
Which Best describes this man in descent  
Caught beteween love  
And what I meant  
Didn't I promise always to  
Shelter and protect you  
Didn't I answer - Yes I do  
Well, today I'm not so sure  
Didn't the stars shine awful bright then  
Didn't I look into your eyes and  
Didn't I swear I'd always be there  
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Today I'm not so sure
