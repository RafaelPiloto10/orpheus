One man does his work  
He's not satisfied not at all  
Feels like that he's being used  
His self respect starts to fall  
His frustration  
Running very very high he takes it out  
On the ones he loves, because it's safe  
And who they gonna tell  
And he hates that cold-bloodedness  
That runs inside  
  
Oh yes  
It's hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
Hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
  
Sister,  
She's got a lot of pride  
You can see it when she walks into the room  
But she's young  
And she's unaware  
Of what a brutal world can do to you  
So she loves a man  
He lies like a dog  
Tears her little world all apart  
So the walls go up  
For the rest of her days  
And there ain't no man can touch this  
Girls heart  
  
Oh yes.  
It's hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
Hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
  
So we walk  
From the front porch to the back yard  
Just to laugh and say hello and  
Say goodbye  
But some days are hard, like a  
Soldier's steel-toed boots  
And the rent we pay to stay here  
Gets high  
  
Oh yes.  
It's hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
Hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times
