Ooh, hoo  
Get up in the morning  
'Bout a quarter to nine  
Get home in the evenin'  
Too tired to make time  
Give me the lovin'  
I've been waiting for all day  
You're always a little too tired  
To ever look my way  
  
You got me hungry for your love  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
I ache inside  
With a lovin' desire  
But you're too tired, baby  
To light my fire  
I work in this house all day  
And I get tired too  
There ain't a day goes by  
I ain't willing to make love to you  
  
I'm hungry for your love  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table, ah  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
Hey, sometimes in the middle of the day  
I get lovin' you on my mind  
But as soon as you get home  
You read the paper  
Ain't got the time  
  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, who you been doin'?  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
I said I'm hungry for your lovin'  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me is the crumbs off the table  
Hungry for your love  
But you
