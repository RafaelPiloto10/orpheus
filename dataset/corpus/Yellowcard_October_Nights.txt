Warm October nights  
You came and cuddled next to me, baby, yeah yeah yeah  
Our noses brushed so close  
I wished it was our souls  
Drifting off to sleep  
I could hear the little snores you made  
Watching eyes shut tight  
Like doors to something sweeter where you rest  
  
Tear me off a piece of blanket  
Keep me warm and we can make it  
Here's my heart, I'll let you break it  
Touch your skin and I can't take it  
  
Light will creep in soon  
And I still haven't slept a wink, baby, yeah yeah yeah  
I wish the sun would hide his head  
So I could watch you dream some more  
Wish the sun would hide his head  
So I could watch you dream some more  
  
I want to watch you dream some more  
I want to watch you dream some more girl  
I want to watch you dream some more  
I want to watch you  
  
Tear me off a piece of blanket  
Keep me warm and we can make it  
Here's my heart, I'll let you break it  
Touch your skin
