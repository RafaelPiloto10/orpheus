My days have grown so lonely  
For you I cry, for you dear only  
Why haven't you seen it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
  
I spend my days in longin'  
I'm wondering why it's me you're wronging  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
  
I can't believe it  
It's hard to conceive it  
That you'd throw away romance  
Are you pretending  
It looks like the ending  
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear  
  
My life a hell you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender  
Myself to you body and soul  
  
What lies before me  
A future that's stormy  
A winter that's gray and cold  
Unless there's magic the end will be tragic  
And therefor a tale that's so often told  
  
My life revolves about you  
What earthly good am I without you  
Oh I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul
