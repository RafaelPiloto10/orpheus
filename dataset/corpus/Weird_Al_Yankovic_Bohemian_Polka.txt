Is this the real life  
Is this just fantasy  
Caught in a landslide  
No escape from reality  
Open your eyes  
Look up to the skies and see  
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy  
'Cause I'm easy come, easy go  
Little high, little low  
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me  
To me  
  
Mama, just killed a man  
Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead  
Mama, life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama, ooo  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  
  
Too late, my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama, ooo  
I don't want to die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a mam  
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the Fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning - very, very frightening me  
Galileo, Galileo  
Galileo, Galileo  
Galileo figaro - Magnifico... Hey! Hey! Hey!  
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me  
He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?  
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go  
Will not let you go - let him go  
Will not let you go - let him go  
No, no, no, no, no no no no no!  
  
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me  
For me  
  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh, baby - Can't do this to me, baby  
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here  
  
Nothing really matters  
Anyone can see  
Nothing really matters  
Nothing really matters to me Anyway the wind blows - Hey!
