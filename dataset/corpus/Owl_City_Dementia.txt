Dementia, you're driving me crazy  
  
This is driving me crazy  
Dementia, Dementia, Dementia  
Every light in the night flickered in and out  
Every bone in my back shivered up and down  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every voice from my head shouted yes and no  
Every freight train that fought fought to stop and go  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Be surprised I'm a ghost keeping out of sight  
  
Open up your eyes you're a star in the summer night  
This is love this is war, it's insanity  
Dementia you're driving me crazy!  
Dementia, you're driving me crazy!  
This is driving me crazy  
Every tear in my eyes dripping wouldn't drop  
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop  
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every hand let me go that I try to hold,  
Every warm heart it loved left me feeling cold  
Keep the pace just in
