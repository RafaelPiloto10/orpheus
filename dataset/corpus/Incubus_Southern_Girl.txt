Is everything a baited hook?  
And are there locks on all doors?  
If you're looking for an open book  
Look no further  
I am yours  
  
We'll behave like animals  
Swing from tree to tree  
We could do anything that turns you up and sets you free  
  
You're an exception to the rule  
You're a bonafide rarity  
You're all I ever wanted  
Southern girl, could you want me?  
  
Come outside and walk with me  
We'll try each other on to see if we fit  
And with our roots become a tree  
To shade what we make under it.  
  
We'll behave like animals  
Swing from tree to tree  
We could do anything that turns you up and sets you free  
  
You're an exception to the rule  
You're a bonafide rarity  
You're all I ever wanted  
Southern girl, could you want me?  
  
You're an exception to the rule  
You're a bonafide rarity  
You're all I ever wanted  
Southern girl, could you want me? [Repeat: x7]  
Southern girl
