One and the same, one and the same  
I wish I could see beyond the filthy blue horizon, see what lies ahead of me  
Perhaps I'd see the path of my own destruction  
And avoid my destiny, she said Heaven and Hell is one and the same boy  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, was one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true  
  
I wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion  
Who are you girl, I'm a man, now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction  
So I'm gonna do you the very best way I can  
  
She said Heaven and Hell is one and the same, boy  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true  
  
Wish I could find some time to stop and smell the roses  
My landlord won't let me be, my head is full of paranoia  
New roses, tryin' to consume my identity  
  
She said heaven and hell is one and the same, boy  
She told me heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle, yes we do  
She told me heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true, it just can't be true  
  
Children grow and women produce and men go work and some go stealin' (repeat
X1)  
Heaven and Hell (children grow and women produce), here on Earth (and men go
work and some go stealin') X7
