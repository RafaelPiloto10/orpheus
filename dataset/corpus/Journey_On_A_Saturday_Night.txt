Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright  
Yes she did, well come to bed and turn out the light  
She's sleeping there, she's dreaming through her life  
Yes she is  
Well you know you've done no wrong  
All you done is sing this song  
You sing this song, yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
That's when the bad man meets his fate  
Sitting there, you're feeling only second rate  
You're sorry now, you've come a little bit too late  
Yes you did  
But when you come around  
You only bring you down  
You feel a clown, yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright, yeah  
Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright  
You know she said, you've got to see the coming light  
You know you are, you're riding through your life  
Yes you are  
Well you know you've done your best  
All you need's a little rest  
You've done your best, yes  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Saturday night  
Saturday night
