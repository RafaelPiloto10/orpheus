Did you get your race card?  
I didn't get my race card  
Did you get your race card?  
Hell no, I didn't get my race card!  
Did you get your race card?  
Homeboy, where'd you get your race card?  
Did you get your race card?  
White boy, what is a race card?  
  
Please don't believe the hype  
Everything in the world ain't black and white  
Everybody ain't a stereotype  
Just because I look wrong, I'm about to do right  
Please don't believe the hype  
Everything in the world ain't black and white  
Everybody ain't a stereotype  
Just because I look wrong, I'm about to do right  
  
Black as midnight, or bright as Snow White  
You'd better do me right, or I'ma have to take flight  
Put you on ice, blast on you twice  
If you're a zebra, better come out them stripes  
Just because I'm dressed like I'm straight out of jail  
Make more money then them white boys at Yale  
And got more sense than your fucking President  
That college graduate? He can't pay his rent  
But don't call me brother, man  
Unless your ass got my money in your other hand  
Pull that black man shit, that white man shit  
But see a suit and tie, and I'll still get your ass euthanized  
'cause I never got my race card in the mail  
Is that the reason why my life still hard as Hell?  
I've been to jail, just like Martha Stewart  
And we both told the judge that we didn't do it  
  
Did you get your race card?  
Hell, no, I didn't get my race card!  
Did you get your race card?  
Everybody, show me your race card!  
Did you get your race card?  
Yo, what the hell is race card?  
Did you get your race card?  
Can anybody tell me what is a race card?  
  
Please don't believe the hype  
Everything in the world ain't black and white  
Everybody ain't a stereotype  
Just because I look wrong, I'm about to do right  
Please don't believe the hype  
Everything in the world ain't black and white  
Everybody ain't a stereotype  
Just because I look wrong, I'm about to do right  
  
Did you get your race card?  
Did you get your race card?  
Did you get your race card?
