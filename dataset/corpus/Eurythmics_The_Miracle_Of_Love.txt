How many sorrows  
Do you try to hide  
In a world of illusion  
That's covering your mind?  
I'll show you something good  
Oh I'll show you something good.  
When you open your mind  
You'll discover the sign  
That there's something  
You're longing to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
The miracle of love  
Will take away your pain  
When the miracle of love  
Comes your way again.  
  
Cruel is the night  
That covers up your fears.  
Tender is the one  
That wipes away your tears.  
There must be a bitter breeze  
To make you sting so viciously  
They say the greatest coward  
Can hurt the most ferociously.  
But I'll show you something good.  
Oh I'll show you something good.  
If you open your heart  
You can make a start  
When your crumbling world falls apart.  
  
[Chorus]
