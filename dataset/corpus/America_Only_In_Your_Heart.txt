Mary, have you seen better days  
And will you find different ways  
And does he really mean that much to your heart  
Carry, all of the weight you can find another man  
And lead him directly there to the source  
You've got to chart his course  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
Wake up from an elusive dream  
You've got to change the scene  
It's getting so hard to see the end  
Break down all of the walls you can  
You need a helping hand  
I'm sure there's someone there just for you  
He's trying to make it too  
  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
Only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
You can't disregard your friends  
But life gets so hard when you reach the end  
Mary, have you seen better days
