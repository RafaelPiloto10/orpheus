So whatcha doin' tonight?  
Have you heard that the world's gone crazy?  
Young Americans listen when I say there's people puttin' us down  
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy  
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days  
Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun  
Quick trick plans, take the money and run  
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done  
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun.  
Whatcha doin' tonight, I got faith in our generation  
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes  
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination  
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules  
  
Come on take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools  
No more big shots, crackpots bending the rules  
A fair shot here for me and for you  
Knowing that we can't lose  
  
And we'll be rockin' in Paradise  
Rockin' the Paradise tonight  
Rockin' in Paradise  
Rockin' the Paradise tonight  
Tonight, tonight...
