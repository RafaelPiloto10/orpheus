How can I make it through the day  
Without you  
You have been so much a part of me (and if you'll go)  
I'll never know what to do  
  
How can I carry on my way  
The memories  
When all that is left is the pain in my history  
Why should I live my life today  
  
[Refrain]  
I can't live out on my own (I can't do anything at all)  
And just forget the love you've always shown  
And accept the fate of my condition  
Please don't ever go  
For I cannot live my life alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go out my way  
Say you'll never go  
For we can still go on  
And make it through  
Just say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go away  
  
How can I make my dreams come true  
Without you  
You were the one who gave love to me (and don't you know)  
Your are my fantasy  
  
(Repeat Refrain)  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
