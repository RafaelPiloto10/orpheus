The mist is slowly lifting  
The sound of life misplaced your mind  
You're sitting, spellbound through out time  
I hope that you remember what you find  
Singin' more of a lifetime  
  
You put it down-all that I'm thinking  
but take a long and distant search, when all is right  
you take for granted  
You can't look down but you're no worse.  
Singin' more of a lifetime  
  
The countless visions that are drifting  
The silver dreams you hate to lose.  
There's no harm. We've all been waiting.  
well keep your faith. Do what you choose.  
Singin' more of a lifetime
