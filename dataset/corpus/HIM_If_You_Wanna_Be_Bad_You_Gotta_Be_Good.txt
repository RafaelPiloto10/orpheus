She got a nasty reputation and a talent for sin  
She's the kinda trouble I like to be in  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna be your slav  
She's the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave  
So give it what you want boy  
Let's make it understood  
That if ya wanna be bad ya you gotta be good  
  
She says there'll be no lying  
No foolin' around  
No seven day weekends  
No nights on the town  
Well that's the way I want it  
That's the way it's gotta be  
If you're looking for trouble better get it from me  
So get on your knees boy and do what you should  
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good  
  
Let's make a night to remember  
From January to December  
Let's make love to excite us  
A memory to ignite us  
Let's make honey baby soft and tender  
Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender  
Let's make a night to remember all life long
