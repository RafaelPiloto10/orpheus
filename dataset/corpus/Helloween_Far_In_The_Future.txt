Can you hear - isolated  
Can you see - aberrated  
Can you sigh, I'm frustrated  
Make my day  
Can you feel animation  
Shall I bring you salvation  
No, I hate this temptation  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Meet you somewhere  
Far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
I'll wait  
Wait  
  
Hear my voice, I don't care what they're saying  
Feel my touch, I think you're only sleeping  
They say you're like blind  
They say you're like dead  
Still the day will come, I may stop weeping  
  
I play you heavy metal  
Soul, punk, dance to unsettle  
One sign please, one reaction  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Wake up somewhere far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
I'll wait for you  
I'll wait for you  
  
One of us is dying  
One's left behind  
Two of us are crying  
One loud and one in mind  
When your heart stops beating  
I'll go your way  
When you yet start speaking  
You made my day, day, day  
Got to pray, pray, pray  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Meet you somewhere far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
Far in the future  
There hides another life  
Far in the future  
We let it all revive  
I'll wait  
Wait  
Wait
