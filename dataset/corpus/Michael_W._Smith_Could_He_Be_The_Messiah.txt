Been here for days, I'm amazed (at) this teacher, carpenter, preacher  
Lost in the crowd, I hear him now, He's praying and He's saying, "God feed
them all"  
Five-thousand men, all of His friends are worried find bread and hurry  
Five loaves and fish, what can He wish, He's praying still He's saying, "God
feed them all"  
  
[Chorus]  
Could He be the Messiah?  
Miracle man, part of the plan  
Could He be the Messiah?  
Life in His hand,  
I understand He could be  
  
Meet for our needs fully He feeds our hunger older and younger  
Twelve baskets more, can we ignore, He shows us that He knows us, is He the
Christ?  
God in His eyes, I realize His power, need of the hour  
Jesus is His name, they say He came to feed us and to receive us, is He the
Christ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It is He the Messiah!  
Miracle man, part of the plan  
It is He the Messiah!  
Life in His hand  
I understand it is He  
  
[Chorus]
