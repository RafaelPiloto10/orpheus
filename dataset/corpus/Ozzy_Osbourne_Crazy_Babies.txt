Crazy  
Babies  
  
Crazy babies never say die  
Born to live on a permanent high  
Flying high above the world below  
They'd better come down soon or everyone will know just why  
Nobody's gonna change them, change them  
They've gone over the top  
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them  
They're never gonna stop  
  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
  
Crazy  
Babies  
  
When they were born they were born to be wild  
Some say I'm another devil's child  
Crazy babies in a world of their own  
I am a crazy babe you'd better leave me alone tonight  
  
Nobody's gonna change me, change me  
I'm gonna do this 'til I die  
Nobody's gonna tame me, tame me  
So you better not try  
  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
  
Crazy  
Babies  
  
No use talkin 'bout if they'll last  
Where they're goin' or about their past  
They're just the result of our Society  
So frustrated just like you and me, that's right  
  
Nobody's gonna change them, change them  
They've gone over the top  
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them  
They're never gonna stop  
  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk
