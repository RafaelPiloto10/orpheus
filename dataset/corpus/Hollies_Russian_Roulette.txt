Back street dive down in New Orleans  
Gambler shows his face  
The place was full of jacks and queens  
But I never came up with that bread-winning ace  
Whisky's cheap at twice the price  
When it kills the pain of bad tumbling dice  
The scene's all set for an IOU  
Give it one more spin then that's me I'm through  
The wheel's like a chamber in Russian roulette  
I'm takin' a chance and I'm gunnin' for red  
The wheel's like a chamber in Russian roulette  
I'm takin' a chance and I'm gunnin' for red  
Lost my shirt headed for the bar  
Gonna drown my sorrows in a whisky jar  
Head hung low because I got beat  
I see a hundred dollar bill layin' at my feet  
chorus  
Headed for the tables I'm wearin' my shades  
Got to find me a lucky green top,  
Can't be one I've played  
My hands are shakin' don't wanna lose my cool  
Should I keep the big see or gamble like a fool?  
chorus
