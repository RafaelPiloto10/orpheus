First, I'll acknowledge  
All trust has been broken  
A successful recovery  
I pray for us at night  
  
Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
Just tryna make it right.  
  
Make it right  
Make it right  
Make it right  
This time I'll do you right  
  
Missing your good intentions  
Missing you from a distance  
Hope you did the same  
  
I know that I caused a problem  
Know that I left you livid  
Pushed you far away  
  
Learned it don't pay to lie  
Cause I don't wanna see you cry  
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast  
I'ma hold it back inside  
  
But now that I'm back around ya  
Nothing else really matters  
Hope you feel the same

Make it Right  
Make it right  
Make it right  
This time I'll do you right  
  
I'm going through all the motions  
Trying to find a reason  
That we ended that way  
  
Nothing in life is perfect  
We'll be changing like the seasons  
That's what they used to say  
  
If it's going to sleep alone at night  
I don't wanna close my eyes  
Wanna give you all I have to give  
I'm not holdin back this time  
  
Now that I'm back around ya,  
Nothin around me matters  
Hope you feel the same

Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
And tryna make it right.  
  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
This time I'll do you right  
  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right
