Silver leaves are spinning round  
Take my hand as we go down and down and down  
Looking for water  
But I lost God in a New York minute  
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it  
(Looking looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
(Looking looking looking)  
I can't breathe the air  
Can't raise the fight  
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night  
And I'm  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
  
Take my hand as we go down and down  
Leave it all behind nothing will be found  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking everywhere  
Looking for water  
Looking here and there  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
  
I can't live in this cage  
I can't eat this candy  
To the ends of the Earth  
To this pain in my head  
The look in your eyes  
That never means never  
The dawns early light  
Baby dumb is forever  
  
(Looking looking)  
(Looking looking)  
  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water
