So fine  
So fine, yeah!  
And babe you're mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you  
Oh, there's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you  
Because you're  
So fine  
So fine  
And every time we meet,  
My heart skips a beat.  
You're in my first cup of coffee,  
Gonna be my last cup of tea  
Because you're  
So, fine!  
And babe you're mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you
