Parking lot, movie screen. I can't feel anything  
Cigarette, beat up tv, I can't feel anything.  
Now that I'm,  
I'm in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now  
Hang around with the people I used to be  
Hang around on a corner waiting to go, have a seat  
Now that I'm  
I'm in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now  
Fifty cents, or a dollar three  
I don't owe you anything.  
Spent a life on a heart  
That would rather not feel anything  
I can try. I can see.  
I can want it to be  
I can laugh. I can feel.  
I can't see anything without dreaming  
It's just like a dream  
I can feel  
I can't see anything that seems real  
Now that I'm  
I'm in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now
