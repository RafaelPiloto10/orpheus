What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
What do you get when you kiss a guy?  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia.  
After you do, he'll never phone you.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
Don't tell me what is all about,  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out,  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You get enough tears to fill an ocean  
That's what you get for your devotion.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow.  
So, for at least until tomorrow,  
I'll never fall in love again!  
I'll never fall in love again!
