Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love  
But I guess I guess I guess is all good  
You can play the game, I'mma still do my thang  
Ain't no better way for it to be put  
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering why you always call my
name  
You think I'm gonna wait around  
I ain't got all day  
  
You don't need another lover  
Don't you let it go  
I already got it covered, let the others know  
  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
  
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
  
Think I give a damn boy don't you know who I am  
I ain't runnin' 'round kissing no dude  
Think somebody else like me gon' come around  
Boy you got it misunderstood  
Put it in your face but you wreckin' us yet  
Like you can't recognize a good thing  
  
Now that you got a chance  
Tell me what it's gon' be?  
  
You don't need another lover  
Don't you let it go  
I already got it covered, let the others know

Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it

You say it's my fault, OK I get it  
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it  
See you put up your wall  
You know you did it, the rise and the fall, just admit it  
You say it's my fault, okay I get it  
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it  
It's the the rise and the fall  
It's the the rise and the fall  
And you could have had it all  
  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump on it, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump on it, jump on it
