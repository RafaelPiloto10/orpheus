Farewell my lovely Johnny, a thousand times adieu  
You are going away from the holy ground and the ones that love you true  
You will sail the salt seas over and then return for sure  
To see again the ones you love and the holy ground once more  
  
You're on the salt sea sailing, and I am safe behind  
Fond letters I will write to you, the secrets of my mind  
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore  
Still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more  
  
I see the storm a-rising, and it's coming quick and soon  
And the night's so dark and cloudy you can scarcely see the moon  
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore  
And still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more  
  
But now the storms are over, and you are safe and well  
We will go into a public house and we'll sit and drink our fill  
We will drink strong ale and porter and we'll make the rafters roar  
And when our money, it is all spent, you'll go to sea once more  
  
You're the one that I adore  
And still I live in hopes that you'll see the holy ground once more
