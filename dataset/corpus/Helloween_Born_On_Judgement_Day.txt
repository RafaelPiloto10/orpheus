My mother died close to me  
And while I lie sobbin' here  
This world's going down with fear  
Armies of minions is all I see  
Creatures in anguish no place to flee  
Living their nightmares the fall from grace  
And so I'm standing here  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born on Judgment Day  
And I have no words to say  
Don't know good or bad  
Kinda feel so sad  
But, still, I sing this song for you  
  
There's no one beside me  
I'm shuddering wearily  
Utterly destitute and all  
Nobility has left mankind  
Turned into vultures, bewildered eyes  
  
Shoved to the abyss, a twisting whirl  
Under the blood red sky  
  
[Chorus: x2]
