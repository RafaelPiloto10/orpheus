Dear Jo:  
I don't know where to begin so I'll just hello  
Dear Jo:  
Is it so much better now you're on your own?  
(Is it alright?) you never believed in yourself  
(Is it alright?) but now that you're free, does it help?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?  
  
Dear Jo:  
Are you living it up every place you go?  
Dear Jo:

Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?

And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?
