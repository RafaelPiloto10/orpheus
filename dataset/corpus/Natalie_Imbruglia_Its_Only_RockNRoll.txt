If I could stick my pen in my heart  
I would spill it all over the stage  
  
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya  
would you think the boy is strange ?  
Ain't he strange  
  
If I could win ya, if I could sing ya  
a love song so divine,  
  
would it be enough for your cheating heart  
if I broke down and cried ?  
If I cried  
  
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it  
I know it's only rock'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do  
  
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it  
I said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely ?  
  
If I could stick a knife in my heart  
suicide right on stage  
  
would it be enough for your teenage lust  
would it help to ease the pain ?  
Ease your brain ?  
  
If I could dig down deep in my heart  
feelings would flood on the page  
  
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya  
would ya think the boy's insane ?  
He's insane  
  
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
