All friends are gone, my heart, it burns like fire  
When the night comes falling, falling from the sky  
I was so wrong, how could I loose my desire  
How many times can we say goodbye  
Love is a sacrifice  
You have to head between the lies  
  
[Chorus: ]  
If I'll never see the sun again  
If I'll never have your helping hand  
If I'll never see a children smile  
My would is lost  
If we don't try  
  
I'm so alone - I cannot stand it forever  
Sometimes I feel, like I can't stand the pain  
All that I want, we can't do it together  
Only with you, I feel like I'm born again  
No matter what I do  
I do it baby just for you  
  
[Chorus: ]
