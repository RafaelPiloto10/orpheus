Whilst flying through an azure cloud  
A crystal girl i'd spy  
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue  
And stuttered as she sighed  
I wish to sing the chicken song  
Ching-a-ling song is fine  
I'd give my jewels and caviar  
To make this daydream mine  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling  
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah  
While stepping through a heaven's eye  
Two lover souls we spied  
They wished the cloud boys sang to me  
  
A cheerful happy cry  
We love to play our love-strong hearts  
No better do we know  
No gifts of money do we give  
For love is all we own  
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling  
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
