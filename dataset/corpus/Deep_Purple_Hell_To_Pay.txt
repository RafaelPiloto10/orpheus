Big Betty or Two-tone Annie his hair was never right  
He used to be cool with a glint in his eye but he lost it overnight  
Spinning would change and things are rearranged and then Annie says to me  
Nothing wrong with the way it was that's the way it's meant to be  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
  
Annie was a die-hard rebel in the good old days of way back when  
The cigarette was cool and all the kids in school could read and count to ten  
Annie once said he had a few to bribe of that there was no doubt  
He never could make us understand what the rebellion was all about  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, yeah, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
  
Two-tone Annie drew up battle plans for making love not war  
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets and behind the garden door  
It came to nothing when it all went down and the band began to play  
Another plan put your head in the sand live to fight another day  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell
