Yes I come around  
Never know a little sooner  
Casts a spell on me  
Casts a spell on me  
Casts a spell on me  
Casts a spell on me....  
Gypsy woman  
Gypsy woman  
Gypsy woman....  
  
Well, you were out trying to turn the tide this morning  
Now mama don't you lie  
You knew it was in the moon and you knew it was in the sky  
Oh, gypsy woman  
Tell me please, gypsy woman  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'  
Casts a spell on me, mama  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'  
Oh, gypsy woman  
  
Mama, everytime you turn around the fire  
Mama, keep me inbetween the devil and the sky  
And every time you look my way  
Mama how you hypnotize  
Tell me please, gypsy woman  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'  
Casts a spell on me, mama  
Casts a spell on me  
That gypsy woman casts a spell on me  
  
But if you come runnin' with desire  
Oh, gypsy woman knows how to get your blood hot higher  
  
Well, asked your daddy  
Your papa wouldn't deny it  
Asked your mama  
Lord, she was quick to agree  
I didn't have to fight your brother  
And your sister's still standin' in line  
Oh, please tell me gypsy woman  
How do you hypnotize me?  
  
We're gonna go down to the river  
Walk in the water  
Oh, we're gonna get all clean  
Then we're gonna do, gonna do  
Exactly darlin' what you  
Came and set your mind on  
  
Casts a spell on me  
Casts a spell on me...  
  
Well, you were out trying to turn the tide this morning  
Now mama don't you lie  
You knew it was in the moon and you knew it was in the sky  
Tell me please, gypsy woman  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'  
Casts a spell on me, mama  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'.....
