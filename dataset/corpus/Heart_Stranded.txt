Standing here helpless  
Where do I go  
If you leave me alone  
Where do I turn now  
If it don't work out  
As far as I can see  
This isn't the way  
You said it would be  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me  
  
Wasn't it you who brought me here  
To the place that lovers go  
Just look at these arms  
Reaching out to you  
Said that you always care  
I just turned around  
And there's nobody there  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
Stranded  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
Stranded
