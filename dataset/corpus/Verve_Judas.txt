Feelings  
Only feelings  
Just let 'em, let 'em go  
  
Feelings  
Only feelings  
Just worthless, so I let 'em go  
  
New York, I was Judas  
She said 'A latte, double shot for Judas'  
Cry for the things that happen, people need to know  
And for a dream to happen  
You gotta let it go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go aha  
Gotta let it go  
  
You let it go  
You let it go  
  
But there must be  
Some answer  
I keep seeking, cause I gotta know  
We are numbered, and we are labeled  
Do we ever, break our home  
  
I knew it, before you said it  
There's no need for, need to wait  
Need to wait  
  
You let it go  
I'm running  
In the sky  
Slipping round  
Hold me up high  
I I I, high high high  
High, high, high  
  
Woohoo  
Still holding on, you know the dreams have just begun  
The dream's just begun  
The dream's just begun  
I know you're still holding on  
Because the dream has just begun
