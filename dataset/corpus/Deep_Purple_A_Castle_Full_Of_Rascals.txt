Nothing here for me today  
Garbaggio from the men in grey  
Don't do this  
You can't do that  
What's the point  
What's the matter, anyway  
Fat cat's licking cream  
Dirty business  
Hard and mean  
Narrow eyes and hungry days  
There's got to be  
A better way  
  
Something here about my face  
Something make you think  
I got time to waste  
What you doing  
Standing here  
Why don't you call  
Someone who cares  
Fat cats all the same  
Easy answers just a game  
Another day nothing changes  
There's got to be a better way  
  
A glistening of questioners  
Prepared the inquisition  
While jackals in the shadows  
Manoeuvre for position  
  
A fundament of righteous men  
A barrow ideals  
The carriage of misjustice  
Crushes all beneath it's wheels  
Conspiracies of silence  
Within the temple walls  
Graveyards full of promises  
Tha no one can recall  
  
A castle full of rascals  
A fortress full of thieves  
A parliament of silver tongues  
That latter to deceive  
  
Oh my darling Carolina  
If you get the chance  
To walk behind here  
She's so clean  
You see no splash  
Just the Texas chainsaw massacre  
Fat cat's got to go  
I'm Rockin' and rollin'  
From my headache to my toes  
She's trying to set the world on fire  
Up there in her Ivory tower
