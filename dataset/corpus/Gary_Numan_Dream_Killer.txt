So I've seen my future  
And I've seen dream killers  
And I've seen you everytime.  
So I've heard opinions  
And I've heard dark rumours  
And I've heard you everytime.  
You hurt my feelings  
You hurt my family  
You hurt my reasons to try  
I can't forgive you  
I will remember  
I'll pay you back one cold day.  
So I've seen my weakness  
And I've seen my heart break  
And I've seen you everytime.  
So I've heard promises  
And I've heard every lie  
And I've heard you everytime.  
You lied to father  
You lied to mother  
You lied to brother and me  
I used to dream, now  
I forget how to  
So should I learn how to lie?  
You take my picture  
You take my ghosts and laugh  
You take my reason  
You take my soul away.  
You take my heartbeat  
You take my innocence  
You take my dreams and  
You'll take my life away.  
So now I'm old news  
And you would change me  
But I'm so tired of this  
There is no comfort  
In fame when it dies  
And I'm so tired of it.
