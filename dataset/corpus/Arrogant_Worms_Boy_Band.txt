You know something girl? I'm thinking about you right now.  
You don't want to know what I'm thinking, girl.  
Or... or do you?  
Girl, you think I'm the bomb,  
But I'm old enough to be dating your mom. And I did.  
She wasn't that bad, but you're grounded if you tell your dad  
That you like the way we dance, with rock-hard abs and plastic pants.  
You give us teddy bears,  
And in return we shave our chest hairs. Yeah, we're so manly.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
Never see a dime for selling out to the man.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.  
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.  
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.  
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.  
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)  
And we're appearing at a mall near you, right beside the food court.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
No one likes us here, but we're big in Japan.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Throw your hands up in the air,  
And wave them around like you just don't care.  
You just don't care, you just don't care,  
Now bring your hands down from the air.  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid and the music's bland.  
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.
