I lost my girl on Monday  
Looking for some sympathy  
I went to church directly  
The lord was not there for me  
Didn't go to work on Tuesday  
Got to drinking around noon  
I lost my heart to a mean bartender  
She knocked me off my stool  
Now the world's spinning 'round too fast, lord  
Won't you let me off on the corner?  
You know a man could take to sinning  
All he needs is a little push in that direction  
I lost my job on Friday  
Said a lack of discipline  
I went to church directly  
Peter said he was not in  
I hit the bar on Sunday  
Looking for some discipline  
I sold my soul to the mean bartender  
She said I'm born again  
Now the world's spinning 'round too fast, lord  
Won't you let me off on the corner?  
You know a man could take to sinning  
All he needs is a little pushing  
You time it just right  
You could send me to the lions tonight
