There's a hidden meaning in everything he says,  
Every close encounter, every kiss, every caress.  
Even the truth has got that bitter taste of a lie.  
Well, I can read his lips but I can't read his mind.  
I can see him dance away now oh oh -- oh oh oh.  
He was one of the kind that seems so hard to find.  
There's a change of weather, now he leaves me far behind.  
That I don't matter to him came as such a surprise.  
Well, I can read his lips, I thought I read his eyes.  
And I can see him dance away now...
