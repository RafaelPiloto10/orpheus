For too long she was feeling  
That her love had lost it meaning  
She was looking for a reason  
Not to breakaway  
But I don't think she can take it  
  
She'll be strong enough for two although  
It's hard for her to do  
She'll breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
It's a secret she's been keeping  
It's been eating at her heart  
Wish I could find the words to tell you  
But I don't know where to start  
And when she looks into the future  
She sees too many problems  
There are so many reasons  
She should pack up the past  
And breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway
