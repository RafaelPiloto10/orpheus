(sopranos)  
Hark! How the bells  
Sweet silver bells  
All seem to say,  
"Throw cares away."  
Christmas is here  
Bringing good cheer  
To young and old  
Meek and the bold  
(Altos)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
(Tenors)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
That is their song  
With joyful ring  
All caroling  
One seems to hear  
Words of good cheer  
From ev'rywhere  
Filling the air  
  
(tenors)  
O how happy are their tones  
(rest of people)  
O how they pound  
Raising the sound  
O'er hill and dale  
Telling the tale  
(together)  
Gaily they ring  
While people sing  
Songs of good cheer  
Christmas is here  
(sopranos)  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
(rest of people)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, ding, dong  
On, on they send  
On without end  
Their joyful tone  
To ev'ry home  
  
(repeat from the beginning)  
(sopranos)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong.  
(bass)  
Bohm
