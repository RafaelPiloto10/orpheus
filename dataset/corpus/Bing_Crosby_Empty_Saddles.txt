There's something strange in the old corral  
There's a breeze, though the wind has died  
Though I'm alone in the old corral  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do you ride tonight?  
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago  
Are you on the trail of buffalo?  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do you ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo  
Are you headin' for the Alamo?  
  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do you talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do you walk tonight?  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
My tears will be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,  
There's no song, still I hear guitars,  
There is no dust, still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars
