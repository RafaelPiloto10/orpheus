To spend one night with you in our old rendez-vous  
And reminis with you, that's my desire  
To hear you whisper low, just when it's time to go  
Oh, cherry 1 love you so, that's my desire  
We'll sip a little glass of wine  
I'll gaze into your eyes devine  
And feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine  
To meet where gipsies play, down in some dim cafe  
And dance till break of day, that's my desire
