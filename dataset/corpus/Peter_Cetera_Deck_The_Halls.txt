Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Tis the season to be jolly  
Don we now our gay apparel  
Troll the ancient Yuledite carol  
See the blazing youle before us  
Strike the harp and join the chorus  
Follow me in merry measure  
While I tell of yuletide treasure  
  
Fa la la la la, la la la la  
  
Fast away the old years passes  
Hail the new, ye las and lasses  
Sing we joyous, all together  
Heedless of the wind and weather  
  
Fa la la la la, la la la la
