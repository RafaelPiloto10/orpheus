In your Easter bonnet  
With all the frills upon it,  
You'll be the grandest lady  
In the Easter parade!  
  
I'll be all in clover,  
And when they look you over  
I'll be the proudest fella  
In the Easter parade!  
  
On the avenue, fifth avenue,  
The photographers will snap us  
And you'll find that you're  
In the rotogravure.  
  
Oh, I could write a sonnet  
About your Easter bonnet  
And of the girl I'm taking  
To the Easter parade!  
  
Oh, I could write a sonnet  
About your Easter bonnet  
And of the girl I'm taking  
To the Easter parade!
