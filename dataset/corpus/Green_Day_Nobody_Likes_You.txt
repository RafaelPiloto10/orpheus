I fell asleep  
While watching Spike tv  
After 10 cups of coffee  
And you're still not here  
  
Dreaming of a song  
But something went wrong  
And you can't tell anyone  
Cuz no one's here  
  
Left me here alone  
When I should have stayed home  
After 10 cups of coffee  
I'm thinking  
  
Where'd you go?  
  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you (where'd you go?)  
They're all out without you  
Having fun (where'd you go?)
