(Dolly Parton)  
He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack  
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack  
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew  
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday  
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made  
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing  
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown  
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone  
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back  
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring
