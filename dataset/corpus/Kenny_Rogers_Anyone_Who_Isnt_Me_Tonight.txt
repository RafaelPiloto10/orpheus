When you made love to me tonight  
I felt as if I'd died and gone to heaven  
And if that's how it feels to die  
Then lay me in your arms I'm through with livin'  
I'll get down on my knees and thank the good lord up above  
That I'm the lucky girl you chose to love.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight.  
  
You've got the kind of body  
That was made to give a man a lot of pleasure  
And what you're giving me tonight  
Is more than anything on earth can measure  
  
Every inch of you that's woman makes me that much more a man  
I've just about enjoyed all that I can stand.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight...
