I'll stay a while, but I won't stay long.  
No I won't, it's been too long since I've been next to my lover,  
I sure had fun, but now I'm thinking ahead  
'Cause of her call and the letter I read,  
It's been too long since I've been next to my lover, hey hey hey hey,  
Even a drivin' wheel must come to rest some time.  
Even a drivin' wheel must come to rest some time.  
It's been too long since I've been next to my lover, o woh woh woh yeah,  
It's been too long since I've been next to my lover, o woh woh woh yeah,  
It's been too long
