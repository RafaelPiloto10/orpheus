I see people walking down the street  
Got their heads so high  
They can't see their feet  
With their blinders on  
They walk the endless mile  
Working for that perfect life of style  
  
But I'm lookin' for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'm still climbing oh yeah  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
I hear people talkin' all day long  
Got their minds made up  
They can't do no wrong  
With their hearts so cold  
They never ever feel  
Losing touch with everything that's real  
  
But I'm lookin' for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'm still climbing ooo yea  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
Oh in the darkest hour  
Feel I'm sinkin' low  
But I'll reach higher  
  
Now I'm lookin' for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And I'll be climbing  
Oh I'm still climbing  
Oh yeah  
  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'm still climbing ooo yea  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'm still climbing  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life  
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
