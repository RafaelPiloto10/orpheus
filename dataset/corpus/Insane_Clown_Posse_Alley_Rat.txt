Gang bang. Pissed off. Swang thangs. Shit talk. Southwest. Street hood. Spit
on. Ripped  
Off. No hoes. Pro wings. No real. Gold rings. Lips swoll. Chin rocked. Eyes in
them "O"  
Rings. Street clown. No joke. Voodoo. No hox. Never die. can't croke. Strokes
for them old  
Folks. Smoke dope. Pop pills. Lift axe. Chops kill. Drink blood. Drip spills.
Grab the mic  
And drop skills chased off. Broke down. People up Folk down. Full moon. Choke
sound. On the  
Murder-go-round. No love. No slack. Pie face. Slap back. Heffer,let me tap
that. Like you a  
Chip munk and...  
[Chorus]  
I'm an alley rat, an alley rat  
I only want to be where the scrubs be at.  
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it.  
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it  
I gotta get it...  
Last place. don't care. Scrub life. I'm there. Red mist. I wear. Wet blood.
Big smear. Just  
Know. Dark nights. Warm glow. Street lights. Breakin in. Tied tight. I'm
taking all I like.  
No look. Fuck style. Never calm. Buck wild. Jumpin off. Rooftops. Face
painted. Fake smile.  
(Who? What? What chuck? Nevermind. What the Fuck?)  
Now I'm ridin up stuck underneath an ups truck.  
(What you see? I looked around. Tell me. Thought I seen a clown)  
No peep. Not a sound. No one lookin. Never found. Fuck jobs. Fuck rules. Fuck
church. Fuck  
School. Fuck court. Fuck jail. Hospitals and funerals (fuck em)  
I ain't goin I'm hoein you hoes out. When I die, bury me with my dick in your
mouth  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I'm an alley rat, an alley rat  
I only want to be where the scrubs be at.  
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it.  
I gotta get it, I wanna get it, the lot I gotta get it  
I gotta get it...
