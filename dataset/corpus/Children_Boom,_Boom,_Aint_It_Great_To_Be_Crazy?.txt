A horse and a flea and three blind mice  
Sat on a curbstone shooting dice  
The horse he slipped and fell on the flea  
"Whoops," said the flea, "There's a horse on me!"  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
  
Way down South where bananas grow  
A flea stepped on an elephant's toe  
The elephant cried, with tears in his eyes  
"Why don't you pick on someone your own size?"  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
  
Way up North where there's ice and snow  
There lived a penguin and his name was Joe  
He got so tired of black and white  
He wore pink slacks to the dance last night!  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
  
Eli, Eli had some socks  
A dollar a pair and a nickel a box  
The more you wear 'em the better they get  
And you put 'em in the water and they don't get wet!  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
  
Called myself on the telephone  
Just to hear that golden tone  
Asked myself out for a date  
Said be ready 'bout half-past eight!  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
  
Took myself to the picture show  
Sat myself on the very last row  
Wrapped my arms around my waist  
Got so fresh I slapped my face!  
  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?
