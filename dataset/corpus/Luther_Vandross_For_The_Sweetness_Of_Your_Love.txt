What's your name?  
Girl what's your number?  
I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw you  
And I couldn't get you off my mind  
You reminded me of candy  
So you be my Mary Jane  
And I'll be your Sugar Daddy  
And we can make sweet love all the time  
  
I'd travel to the farthest star  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
'Cause sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar  
(Is the sweetness of your love)  
My rocket would only stop  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
And all I ever think about  
(Is the sweetness of your love)  
  
If you call for it, I'll deliver  
I'll bring you anything  
So fast it'll make you shiver  
Whatever it is, from A to Z  
Hey, let me prove that I can love you  
I'll do a dance for you  
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you  
Of whomever you dream, I wanna be  
  
I'd take my money out the bank  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
I'd buy you a great big diamond ring  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
'Cause Ooo baby, I'd do anything  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
  
I'd go ten rounds with Sugar Ray  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
And I'd eat my Wheaties everyday  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
BANG! ZOOM! And he would fly away  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
  
You could be lost in danger with a stranger  
Caught up in mystery  
A one night insanity, girl  
And quite an emotional tragedy it would be  
Then I'd come running just to save you  
I'd be your hero guy  
In a flash, in a minute I'd be there in no time  
And you'd be forever loving me
