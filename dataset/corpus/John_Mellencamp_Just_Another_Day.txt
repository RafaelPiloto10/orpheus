Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato  
Call me up every single day  
They don't work and they don't want to  
Come on down to some damn cafe  
  
Bobby Doll tells me  
"Live in the moment"  
Don't get too far ahead-  
Don't live in the past  
I blink my eyes  
And the moment is over  
I guess another day  
Has passed  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato  
Always there with their free advice  
They've got pearl handled pistols  
Underneath their vests  
They want me to go out drinking  
With them tonight  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
You got to clean white sheets in the morning  
Conversation all afternoon  
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato, baby  
And me and you  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day
