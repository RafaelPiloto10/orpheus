So this is Christmas and what have you done,  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.  
  
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,  
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.  
  
And so happy Christmas for black and for white  
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
And so this is Christmas and what have we done  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
War is over if you want it, war is over now.
