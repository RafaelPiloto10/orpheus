Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Noel, Noel  
  
The first Noel  
The angel did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
  
In fields where they  
Lay a keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the east  
Beyond them far  
  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
This by the light  
Of that same star  
Three wise men came  
From country far  
  
To seek for a King  
Was their intent  
And to follow the star  
Wherever it went  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
Born Noel
