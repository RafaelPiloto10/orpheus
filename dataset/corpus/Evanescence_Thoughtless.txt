All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumping through the pages of my fantasies  
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  
I'll see you try to take a swing at me  
Come on, gonna put on the ground, ground, ground  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies  
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown  
I'll kill and rape you the way you raped me  
And I'll pull the trigger  
And you're down, down, down  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? what the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying while you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
All my friends are gone,  
They died  
They all screamed, and cried  
I'm gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down and  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will no be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming
