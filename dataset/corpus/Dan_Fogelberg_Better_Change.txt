I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
There's an angel on your shoulder  
And a devil at your feet  
And that door you see before you  
Could be poison tasting sweet.  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
You gotta tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
You better tear them down.  
Tear them down!
