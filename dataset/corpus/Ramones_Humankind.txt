Humankind, it's not fair, why should we all live in fear  
Humankind, it's a test, to see who's the very best  
Humankind, don't know why, no one cares who lives or dies  
Humankind, don't look at me, look at yourself, what do you see  
  
People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi  
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more  
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a Cadillac  
People - starrin' at your clothes - I can't take it anymore  
  
Humankind, it's a shame, some don't even know their name  
Humankind are so strange, some need to be rearranged  
Humankind, don't know why, no one cares who lives or dies  
Humankind, don't look at me, look at yourself, what do you see  
  
Beg. The humankind during intro part  
Tell me, tell me, who's to blame, for people acting this way  
Tell me, tell me, what's so wrong, if humans just got along  
Tell me, tell me, tell me please, if psychiatric help is what we need
