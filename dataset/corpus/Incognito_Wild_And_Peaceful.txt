There is no greater feeling to unfold  
Guided by the inspiration love is bold  
It is the fire burning in your soul  
It is the story waiting to be told  
Wild and peaceful  
Rare and free  
Wild and peaceful  
Rare and free  
  
You came and took away my emptiness  
Put in its place a gift of tenderness  
  
Wherever your river will flow  
You know my love will follow  
Wherever your river will flow  
You know my love will follow  
Through the jungles of your mind  
  
You are the treasure waiting to be found  
You are the wings that take me heaven bound  
Wild and peaceful  
So rare and free
