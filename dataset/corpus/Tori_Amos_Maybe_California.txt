Hey Mrs. C, please don't jump why not?  
Nothing is making sense anymore to me  
I don't know when I stopped making him smile  
Now the kids see me crying all the time  
  
From one mother to the other  
They'll never get over this for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So let's be strong for you and  
Me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
I'm feeling so (mad dear)  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
As mothers we have our troubles  
You'll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So let's be strong you and me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
I'm feeling so (mad dear)  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
Until then there will be starlight shining down  
For every tear and every child
