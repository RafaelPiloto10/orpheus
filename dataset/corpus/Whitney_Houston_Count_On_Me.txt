[Chorus]  
Count on me through thick and thin  
A friendship that will never end  
When you are weak, I will be strong  
Helping you to carry on  
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid  
Please believe me when I say, count on  
  
I can see that it's hurting you, I can feel your pain  
It's hard to see the sunshine, through the rain, oh  
I know sometimes it seems as if, it's never gonna end  
But you'll get through it  
Just don't give in cause you can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can count on me  
  
I know sometimes it seems as if, we're standing all alone  
Be we'll get through it, 'cause love won't let us fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place inside of all of us  
Where our faith in love begins  
You should reach to find the truth in love  
The answers there within, oh  
I know that life can make you feel  
It's much harder than it really is  
But we'll get through it, just don't give in  
  
[Chorus]
