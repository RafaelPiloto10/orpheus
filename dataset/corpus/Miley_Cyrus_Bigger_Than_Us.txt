(L. O. V. E. Love, L. O. V. E...)  
  
I see your face, I look in your eyes,  
What you feel is no surprise,  
Everyone needs something to believe in,  
Tell me your dreams, I'll tell you mine,  
In our hearts we'll look inside,  
And see all of the colors of the rainbow,  
I know!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We all want to believe in love,  
We all want to believe in something,  
Bigger than just us,  
We all want to be a part,  
Of the greater picture,  
That's hangin' in our hearts,  
Yeah it's bigger than us!  
  
I want to see beyond my own little world,  
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy,  
See the world with clarity,  
Oh-oo-oh,  
We all have a long way to go,  
But I know,  
We're getting closer everyday,  
Everyday!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We all want to believe in love,  
We all want to believe in something,  
Bigger than just us,  
We all want to be a part,  
Of the greater picture,  
That's hangin' in our heart,  
Yeah bigger than us!  
  
It fills the universe,  
It lights the skies above,  
It rescues our hearts with love,  
  
(L. O. V. E, love)with love! (l. O. V. E, love)  
That's what's bigger than us! (bigger than us, c'mon)  
  
It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us  
  
It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us  
(Whoo!)  
It's love, it's love! (it's love, it's love!)  
  
We all want to believe in love,  
  
We all want to believe in something,  
  
Bigger than just us!
