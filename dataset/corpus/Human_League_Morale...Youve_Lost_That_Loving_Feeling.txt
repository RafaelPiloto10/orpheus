Don't talk  
Close the door  
You've been here before  
  
Your shape dim  
I'm an old man now  
The air's thin  
The walls very damp now  
And if I don't go  
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room  
With a view of the corner  
  
I don't forget  
The light growing weak now  
Experience is useless  
Unless you can learn  
And I've never met anyone  
Who used their knowledge  
To avoid those mistakes made again and again  
  
And if I don't go  
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room  
With a view of the corner  
  
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips  
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips  
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)  
But baby, baby I know it  
  
You've lost that loving feeling  
Woah, that loving feeling  
You've lost that loving feeling  
Now it's gone, gone, gone  
Woah-woah  
  
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you  
And girl you're starting to criticize little things I do  
It makes me just feel like crying (baby)  
Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying  
  
You've lost that loving feeling  
Woah, that loving feeling  
You've lost that loving feeling  
Now it's gone, gone, gone  
Woah-woah  
  
Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you  
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah  
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day  
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away  
  
Bring back that loving feeling  
Woah, that loving feeling  
Bring back that loving feeling  
Now it's gone, gone, gone  
And I can't go on  
  
Baby (baby), baby (baby)  
I want you please (woooo)  
Please (woooo)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
Now it bring it on back (bring it on back)  
Bring it on back now (bring it on back now)  
Now bring it on back
