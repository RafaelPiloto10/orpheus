[Verse 1]  
I've made them love, I've made them cry  
But now the rain clouds are lonely inside  
They don't know how it feels to know how I feel  
I try to escape from everything that is real  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation  
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind  
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing  
Day by day creating in my imagination  
  
[Verse 2]  
The well has run dry of all my ideas  
Silence so loud, have to cover my ears  
I'm closing the door, it's hurting too much  
I'm runnIng away from everything I can touch  
  
[Chorus 2]  
To hide in my imagination, there is always magic waiting  
Never counting time, always on my mind  
There's a place that only I see, far away from all that I see  
Inch by inch creating, in my imagination  
  
[Verse 3]  
I can stop it all from hurting  
With this mind, I can stop the world from turning  
Don't know how it feels to know how I feel  
I try to escape from everything that is real  
  
[Chorus 1]
