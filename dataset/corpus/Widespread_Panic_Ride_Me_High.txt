Low-down way you're feeling, the sexy things you do  
Baby, baby, baby, let me talk to you  
I just love to whisper in your sexy ear  
Tell you that I love you, take away your fear  
Destroy your inhibitions, ridin' back the day  
Low-down, slow down, keeping low down in that funky way  
  
Higher, higher, higher, how high can you go  
Ride me high this morning, ride me high some more  
  
The way you move your body, it is a crying shame  
I won't tell nobody if you will do the same  
If you leave tomorrow, one thing that's for sure  
The more you get, the more you've got, the more you want some more  
  
Higher, higher, higher, how high can you go  
Ride me high this morning, ride me high some more
