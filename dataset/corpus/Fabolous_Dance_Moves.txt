Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool  
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out.  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
The nfl must think I'm a damn fool  
Every time I touch down, I bust a dance move  
They use to have a movement, now they can't move  
Used to be on that glizzy like van couv  
Bout' to make em'? Move, L. A to st. Lou  
Say you got them toys, that santa story just ain't true  
Say you get this money, I'm no snitch I can't tell  
Call me mc Hammer, name a bitch that I ain't nail  
Can't touch this, you know that you can't touch this  
All black jewelry, now that shit do it justice  
Stand back while I bust this, you look like you does this  
Come and rub my hair girl, teach me how to Douglas.  
  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool  
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move.  
  
Yeah lot of strong  
All up in they V. I  
Smokin' on what seems to be loud  
I'm lookin' like Mr. Miya  
Lot of shones  
Nigga can't you tell that we high?  
And before I leave, I'll peace out  
Let me see that camel, 3 times  
Slight work though, nightwork though, my girl don't  
Y'all girl go where my girl go and you her alone.  
2 nights, made a hundred grand  
Pair of Nikes like one to ten  
It was hustle time and y'all walked it out  
When the money right, y'all runnin' man  
Pullin up the whole?  
Geechin' out with no cataract  
If you could understand what this watch cost  
You would understand why I try and adapt  
Me and him cannot shake hands, why trap when I'm a free man?  
You so a loss, you a robot, who done told y'all niggas to break dance?  
  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
