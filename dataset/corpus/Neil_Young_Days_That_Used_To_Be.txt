People say don't rock the boat,  
Let things go their own way  
Ideas that once seem so right,  
Now have gotten hard to say  
I wish I could talk to you,  
You could talk to me  
'Cause there's very few of us left  
My friend  
From the days that used to be.  
  
Seem like such a simple thing  
To follow one's own dream  
But possessions and concession  
Are not often what they seem  
They drag you down  
And load you down  
In disguise of security.  
But we never had  
To make those deals  
In the days that used to be.  
  
Talk to me, my long lost friend,  
Tell me how you are  
Are you happy with  
Your circumstance,  
Are you driving a new car  
Does it get you where you wanna go,  
With a seven year warranty  
Or just another  
Hundred thousand miles away  
From days that used to be.
