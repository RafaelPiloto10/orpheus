Before I fly and wave goodbye  
I say to you "days with you are the best years of my life"  
But if I don't see you anymore  
Keep my words safely stored  
And i'll be back I promise once more  
  
Chorus:  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Till I see you again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
  
Remember me 'cause I care  
Where you are and how you fare  
Get in touch if the wind blows in your face  
I guess it's been too much fun  
We've shared and we've won  
Yes the best is yet to come  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
That one word hurts so bad  
You leave the best you've had  
But you keep the faith and pray to return  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye
