Ow, people gather round me, it's whom it may concern.  
I'm not trying to run your life.  
  
But you're never too old to learn, huh.  
  
Stop worrying about your neighbors and the fancy things they got.  
'Cause if you do you'll find it sure, you're gonna wind up on the spot.  
  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Jone: Get you down, oh down.  
  
One more time.  
  
Don't let the Joneses  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Woo, woo oh oh oh  
  
Huh, you may not believe it but nine times out of ten it's true.  
The people you're trying to keep up with  
  
Are trying to keep up too.  
  
Remember that old saying, "All that glitters ain't gold".  
Take heed, don't ignore it until your money time will hold. Oh  
  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Hear me now, now.  
  
Don't let the Joneses  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Who-har-har-who-who, Who-har-har-do-do-do-do  
  
You're lying to yourself but you don't even know it.  
You're so busy following the Joneses, you ain't got time to show it.  
Keeping up with the Joneses, it'll only makes your life a mess.  
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and getting deeper in debt.  
  
You better leave  
The Joneses alone.  
Tell 'em one more time.  
You better leave, oh leave  
The Joneses alone.  
  
Otis: Joneses got a new car today.  
Here's what you should say  
Harray for the Joneses!  
Instead you worry till your whole head turns gray.  
Worry 'bout the Joneses.  
  
Melvin Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay.  
So leave Jo-Jo-Joneses alone.  
Listen, your car might be old, but remember it never fails to get you where
you want to go.  
  
Oh, don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Hear me now, now.  
  
Don't let the Joneses  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Do do do do do do  
  
You're doing fine.  
Don't let the Joneses get you down.  
Now listen, if you see something you want and you know you can't afford it,  
The very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it.  
The Joneses have been a downfall for many persons, you see.  
So people, take my advice and let the Joneses be. Ow.  
  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Jones  
Don't let the Joneses  
Get you down, oh down.  
  
Hear me now, now.  
  
Don't let the Joneses

Get you down, oh down.  
  
You're doing fine.  
Don't let the Joneses get you down. (Who)  
You're doing fine.  
Don't let the Joneses get you down. (Who)  
  
Do do do do do do  
Boom-boom-boom-boom
