From the way that you acted  
To the way that I felt it  
It wasn't worth my time  
And now it's sad cause all I missed  
Wasn't that good to begin with  
And now I've started you begging  
Saying things that you don't mean  
It isn't worth my time  
A line's a dime a million times  
And I'm about to see all of them  
  
Goodbye to you  
You're taking up my time  
  
You call my name when I wake up  
To see things go your way  
I'm coughing up my time  
Each drag's a drop of blood a grain  
A minute of my life  
It's all I've got just to stay down  
Why the fuck am I still down  
I'm hoarding all that's mine  
Each time I let just one slip by  
I'm wasting what is mine  
  
I'm about to see a million things  
I thought I'd never see before and I  
I'm about to do all the things I've dreamed of  
And I don't even miss you at all
