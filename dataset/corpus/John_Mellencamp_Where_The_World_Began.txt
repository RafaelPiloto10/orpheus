I'm tired of being grateful for a chance to take a dive  
I'm sick of everything I do just to keep myself alive  
When you cut away the skin that bears the brand  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Saw the man in Jamaica, he had a shadow on his back  
I recalled the ring of fire, and he wore his suit of black  
When the legend and the ocean meet the sand  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Everyone is so fabulous, hey, we all got our gun  
Old Snakey's not a sinner, no, he just shows us how it's done  
When you separate the wretched from the damned  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began
