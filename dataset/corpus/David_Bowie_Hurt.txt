I hurt myself today  
To see  
If I still feel  
I focus on the pain  
The only thing that's real  
The needle tears a hole  
The old familiar sting  
Try to kill it all away  
But I remember everything  
  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
  
I wear my crown of shit  
On my liar's chair  
Full of broken thoughts  
I cannot repair  
Beneath the stain of time  
The feeling disappears  
You are someone else  
I am still right here  
  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
If I could start again  
A million miles away  
I would keep myself  
I would find a way
