Ray: When Uncle Sam called us up,  
We hit that Eastern Sand,  
Fought like Hell for three long years,  
In that South Asian Land,  
Clint: We met a few foreign ladies,  
Drank a lot of Lukewarm beer,  
(Ray spoken) oh I remember,  
But tonight in this old Tuscan bar  
(Ray) You know what? Its so damn good to see you here.  
Chorus:  
Both: Beers to you, old Amigo, For all the good times,  
And heres to all the women, that we've been through,  
Lets set 'Em up my compadre,  
Ray: Barstool to barstool  
Clint: Shoulder to shoulder  
All right! Beers to you!  
Clint: Ray, you remember back in Phoenix,  
When we walked into that fight?  
Ray: Uh huh,  
Clint: we whipped them local boys (aww did we!),  
Then we bought 'em drinks all night,  
Ray: And when my lovin' wife left for points unknown,  
You were there to fill my glass,  
And it proved to me, A womans love can fade,  
With the taste of Coors,  
And good friends always last,  
Chorus:  
Both: Beers to you, old Amigo, For all the good times,  
And heres to all the women, that we've been through,  
Lets set 'Em up my compadre,  
Ray: Barstool to barstool  
Clint: Shoulder to shoulder.  
All right! Beers to you!  
Clint: Hey Ray, lets have one more,  
Ray: Alright, Clint, its my turn to buy,  
Clint: In that case lets have two,  
Ray: I just remembered, I got a date, two barstools down,  
Clint: You mean that little Redhead?  
Ray: Mmhmm.  
Chorus:  
Both: Beers to you, old Amigo, For all the good times,  
And heres to all the women, that we've been through,  
Lets set 'Em up my compadre,  
Ray: Barstool to barstool  
Clint: Shoulder to shoulder  
All right! Beers to you!  
Beers to you!
