I was on my way to school  
I do'z me,  
I hopped out the drop  
Grabbed my juicy,  
I hopped, skipped and  
Jumped past the  
Hoopdies, But wait  
I forgot to grab my loose  
Leaf, I doubled right back, b-  
Back like who's that  
I did a little dance like  
Cat booom boom cat  
I love how the  
Jocks be watching me me,  
So I grab my crotch and say hehe!  
I be like bum diggity bum  
When I pop my gum,  
They lookin dumb  
Digetty dumb,  
Think they stopin something  
I said excuse me honey,  
I'm b-bugs bunny,  
Elmer Fud aint got my carrots  
So he aiint got nothing for me!  
Cause we the mean girls  
Y-yes we so fetch  
And when we in the yard  
Be jumping double dutch  
We back to the future,  
Pearl ya with da best.!
