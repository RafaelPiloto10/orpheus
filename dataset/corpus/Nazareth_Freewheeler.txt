I'm a freewheeler, an underground dealer  
The kind of guy you never get to know  
So you can quit thinking about stoppin' my drinkin'  
You know I'll go the road I choose to go  
  
I'm a freewheeler, living undercover  
When things get hot I have to move out fast  
When they know I'm lyin', the women come cryin'  
But still I go the road I choose to go  
  
No-one's ever going to re-arrange me  
No-one's ever going to try to change me  
You know I'll go the road I choose to go  
  
I'm doin' fine, takin' my time  
I don't want to settle down  
No,no,no
