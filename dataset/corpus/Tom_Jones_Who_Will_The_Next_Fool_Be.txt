After you get rid of me  
Who will the next fool be?  
I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know...  
There's things he'd like to know  
About the girl I love so  
After all is said and done  
You won't be satisfied with anyone  
So after you get rid of me  
Who will the next fool be?  
Will he believe all of those lies?  
And end up like me, with tears in his eyes?  
I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know...  
And I'd like to be the one to tell it so  
After all is said and done  
You wouldn't be satisfied with anyone  
So after you get rid of me  
Who will the next fool be?
