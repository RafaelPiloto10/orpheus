How can a non-musician discuss the future of music  
From anything other than a consumer point of view?  
These people make decisions for the bulk of us  
Without consulting any of us  
Sales and distributions of our futures  
If this world were fair and right  
They'd give up the car keys this very night  
Damn, hit it  
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Flash forward, 2045  
What did you stand for in the life of your prime  
When faced with the final judgment of today  
Who profited from the game  
That you and your niggas play  
Radical man, save a life  
Come on, take a stand, give that money back  
Let's make a plan, the brand new currency  
Taking care of one another you and me  
Radical, radical  
Flash backward, 1999  
In a world shockful of viruses  
How'd y'all stay alive?  
Depending on this so-called man  
For everything you got comes from his hand  
Food, water, the clothes you wear  
How many of y'all niggas really care?  
We don't care  
Let's define this word, nigga  
Someone who stays high  
Watching their life go by  
Someone content with riding it behind, nigga  
They come in all colors, white, black, Puerto Rican  
But the main niggas we speakin' 'bout  
Wear suits and buy and sell corporations  
With only one thing in mind  
Break it up  
That is the destruction of the  
So-called radical man by 2045  
Let's get radical  
Let's get radical  
Watch me now  
Schooled in the art of digital games  
When the war broke out they called your name  
Everyone of color put on the front line  
Holocaust Avenue, 2009  
Get an education, good job, who says?  
Fool with the gold fronts drinkin' Alize  
They don't play by the rules makin' no sense today  
Gotcha on line so you think it's okay  
Better built cell block, mos def say  
That's where you gonna stay, nigga  
Where you gonna stay, nigga?  
Oh my God, it's the Green Mile  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical man  
What's up, y'all? What y'all wanna do?  
Ain't nobody up in that crew know  
How to really run that computer  
And make it flow  
If you ain't born with it  
You know, talkin' about the to and fro, hit me  
Come on, you know way down  
What George say, fall around, alright  
We claim Miles Davis, not Michaelangelo  
We playin' D-flat in the funk  
You better act like you know  
We don't care what Albert Einstein did  
I'd rather know, rather know  
How they built the pyramid, hey  
James Brown, Chuck D. and Jimi  
Turn me up louder now  
And I don't think y'all hear me  
2045, we will stay alive  
2045, God is on our side  
The whole pop scenario is just nothin'  
But a dream  
The day you wake up is the day  
You get the real cream, nigga  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
This is the funk the industry most fears  
All of us getting together  
In a locked board of directors  
I don't think so  
Ain't nobody runnin' this  
It's all about DNA, the radical man  
Where will you be in 2045?  
30 million people right now  
Are being wiped off the face of the planet  
By a disease they claim has no cure  
In the matter of a blinking eye  
All of us right now can testify  
Take a stand, radical man, oh
