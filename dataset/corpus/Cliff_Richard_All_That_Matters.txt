The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All the rest is just vanity  
That time will shatter  
The only treasure in the life we live  
Is in the measure of the love we give  
All that matters in the end will be  
The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All that matters  
Every heart must change it's shape  
To fit the space that the lifetime makes  
Some regrets and some mistakes  
We touch happiness  
But we can't hold her  
Feelings come and disappear  
I've known the laughter  
I've cried those tears  
I should know better after all these years  
But I'm no wiser,  
I'm just older  
The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All the rest is just vanity  
That time will shatter  
The only treasure in the life we live  
Is in the measure of the love we give  
All that matters in the end will be  
The love in you and the love in me  
Oh, oh  
That's all that matters  
All that matters  
Love is the treasure  
It's all the question of priority  
We've got so much  
That we just don't need  
If it ain't got nothing  
Then it's a luxury  
We can learn to live without it  
The love in you and the love in me  
Reprise
