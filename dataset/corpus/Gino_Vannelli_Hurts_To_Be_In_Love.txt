More and more  
Your kiss is like a half opened door  
I can't get in  
You stop me just before I begin  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you never get enough  
Oh it hurts to be in love  
This endless urge  
Keeps my body right on the verge  
We touch and then  
I wanna do it all over again  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you only want me half as much  
I tell you it hurts to be in love  
I'm always worried you think I'm pushing too hard  
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me I'm going to far  
We touch and then  
I wanna do it all over again  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you only want me half as much  
I tell you it hurts to be in love  
It hurts  
Baby it hurts  
It hurts
