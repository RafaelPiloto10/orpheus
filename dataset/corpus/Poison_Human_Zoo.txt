Well you just step right up, you sexy thing  
Tell me what's been goin' on in that funky little brain  
Come dance with the devil  
You want it when it's gonna cost you  
'cause nothing comes for free  
When you're living in a human zoo  
  
Chorus  
Dance sister dance through the human zoo  
You're such a mess now, girl  
Look what they've done to you...  
In the human zoo  
Look what they've done to you  
  
All love lost, in a fit of rage  
Sell your soul for revenge and seal your fate  
Welcome to the nightmare  
I've been expecting you  
Say anything you like, baby  
Just don't let me hear your point of view  
  
Chorus  
Dance sister dance through the human zoo  
Dance sister dance through the human zoo  
You're such a mess now, girl  
Look what they done to you...  
In the human zoo  
Look what they done to you  
Look what, look what they done, baby  
They made a mess of you  
  
Harmonica solo  
  
Bridge  
Hanoi rocks and saigon rolls  
Just drop the bomb then watch it explode  
Sign of the times read "too young to vote"  
But old enough to die for you  
We got the medication you need  
Just don't let us hear your point of view  
  
Chorus  
Dance sister dance through the human zoo  
Dance sister dance through the human zoo
