When was the point that you showed-  
Move on to another love  
Laughing with kindness  
When did you decide to break  
How much more will it take for two people to be happy?  
But you lied  
Looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
With no shame  
As if we were still the same  
But now I'm back in the game  
I'm over you  
  
When did you decide to go?  
Were you ever going to let me know?  
I was deciding  
When did you decide to change?  
What did I do that made our situation weary?  
  
When you lied  
You looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothng to hide  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now I'm back in the game  
I'm over you  
  
Who was the one to tell?  
I thought I knew you way too well  
But I didn't  
The thought of you thinking of him  
Assumptions made on a whim  
Drives me crazy  
  
'Cause you lied  
Looked me staight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
(But I know you did)  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now I"m back in the game  
I'm Over you
