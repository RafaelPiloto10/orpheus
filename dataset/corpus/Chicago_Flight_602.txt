You are, you are on a plane now  
And on your way up north  
Canada is so far from where you want to be  
Be in California, with sunshine in your heart  
  
But you know there are people  
That you have to be  
Have to be  
Have to be what they say you are  
  
What you always wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Wanted to be just a man  
Fulfilled but a little more free  
  
A little more free  
You are, you are in a hotel  
And in your room alone  
Lying there, but not knowing where you're s'posed to be  
  
Be thinking of be-3s and Leslies going round  
And you know there are people  
That are going to be  
Going to be  
  
Going to see what they say you are  
What you've always wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
I only wanted to be just a man  
  
Fulfilled but a little more free  
A little more free  
A little more free
