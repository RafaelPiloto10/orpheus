You met her in a Turkish town  
But you didn't want to bring her here  
You didn't want her hanging around  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
So you left her there  
  
You're a whole different person  
You're a whole different person  
You're a whole different person  
When you're scared  
  
The eagle screams on Friday  
The Colts are doomed this year  
The fat's finally in the fire  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
Dangerous creeps are everywhere  
  
You're a whole different person  
When you're scared  
  
We have ways to make you talk  
You won't like at all  
If you can't run, walk  
If you can't walk crawl  
But don't look down  
It's a long, long fall  
And you loved her in a Turkish town  
But you didn't want to bring her here  
You didn't want her hanging around  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
So you left her there  
  
You're a whole different person  
You're a whole different person when you're scared
