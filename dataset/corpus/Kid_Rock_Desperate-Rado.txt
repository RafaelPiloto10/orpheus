Back in the mother fuckin saddle  
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin for a battle  
Out on the plains I'm just a loner  
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin me a boner  
  
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley  
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me  
And we didn't even fuck  
I gave my last gold tooth 'n gold nugget to get my dick sucked  
  
3 days out on the frontier  
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer  
I need a slut for a service  
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous  
  
Man I gotta get my rocks off  
'cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft  
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a desperate rado  
Didn't take any practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote  
Horny as a toad trippin off peyote  
Holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack  
  
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack  
And to the law I'm no stranger  
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger  
And then Tonto tried to get down  
  
So I boned his bitch slit he's throat and then I skipped town  
That's the way I run my show  
Paint towns red  
Fuck hoes and then I lay low  
  
I know you think I'm archaic  
But my dick's like a sword  
I see pussy and want to slay it  
Out on the plains it gets linely  
  
Sometimes I feel homely  
New faces  
New towns no one knows me  
Guns cocked in my holster  
  
You see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster  
I'm always lookin for the quick buck  
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt  
Some say my head's hollow  
  
Fuck em... I'm just a  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Desperate rado  
Trottin through the bad lands  
A desperate rado  
Tokin down with all the cowhands  
A desperate rado  
Didn't take much practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow  
In any town I can be found at the local bordello  
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,  
  
And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons  
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin  
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin  
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand  
  
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand  
I'm a low down buckaroo  
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too  
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad  
  
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had  
Known as the ruff ridin Texan  
A bad buck from the day of my inception.  
And I was raised in the poor house  
  
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house  
Now since the day I left the corral  
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal  
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside  
And told me that high was the best way to ride...  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Now I'm a desperate rado  
Always lookin for a fight  
A desperate rado  
Puffin on a peace pipe  
I'm a desperate rado  
On the run from the law  
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw
