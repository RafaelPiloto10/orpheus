Let's fall apart together now  
Zipping cupid in a body bag well-worn  
Next to the mausoleum he was born in  
Picking up the pieces of this gory glory of it all  
From eve to morn, for eve to mourn  
  
[Chorus]  
Have no fear  
There are wounds that are not meant to heal  
And they sing in venere veritas  
Come inside let the fire burn you alive  
And sing baby sing  
There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all  
In venere veritas  
  
Let's fall apart together now.  
  
There is a method to our sadness  
As we drag the mirror ball and chain  
Through the twilight again dressed up in shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We are begging for a reflection  
From an unshuttered heart  
To blind and chase us over the edge  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the wounds that are not meant to heal at all  
  
Let's fall apart together now  
Let's fall apart together now
