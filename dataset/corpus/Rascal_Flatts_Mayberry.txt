Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster  
Than it did in the old days  
So naturally, we have more natural disasters  
From the strain of a fast pace  
Sunday was a day of rest  
Now, it's one more day for progress  
And we can't slow down ?cause more is best  
It's all an endless process  
  
[Chorus]  
(Well) I miss Mayberry  
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke  
Where everything is black and white  
Picking on a six string  
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name  
Watching the clouds roll by  
Bye, bye  
  
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting  
Through the trees as the wind blows  
That's when I climb up here on this mountain  
To look through God's window  
Now I can't fly  
But I got two feet that get me high up here  
Above the noise and city streets  
My worries disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt road  
Not even listed on a map  
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole  
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bye, bye  
(I miss Mayberry, I miss Mayberry)
