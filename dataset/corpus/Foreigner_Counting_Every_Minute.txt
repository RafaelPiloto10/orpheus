Gonna break these chains  
Gonna set myself free  
Gonna turn on the mains  
Feel the power inside of me  
Gonna burn all night--gonna burn all day  
You'll see me coming  
From miles away  
  
Feel me in the air  
Feel me all around you  
Gonna show you how I care  
Teach you something new  
I'm gonna take my time  
Make love to you  
Yeah I know I can satisfy you  
That's what I intend to do  
  
Now I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
I'm calling for you, honey  
Come and get it while it's hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm living it  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Feel me getting closer  
I'm almost there  
Can you fell my fingers  
Running through your hair  
Can you feel my hands  
Draw you closer to me  
Can you hear that clock tick, tick, ticking baby  
I'll soon be there to set you free  
  
I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Don't fool around come and  
Get it while it's hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm living in it  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Counting every minute  
Every single minute  
I'm calling for you, honey  
Come and get it while it's hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm gonna give it  
I'll give it to you honey  
I'll give you everything  
I've got  
  
Yeah I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Don't fool around come and  
Get it while it's hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Baby don't be timid  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
  
I'm calling for you honey  
Come and get it while  
It's hot  
  
I'm counting  
Every single minute  
I'm waiting for you baby  
Give you everything I've got
