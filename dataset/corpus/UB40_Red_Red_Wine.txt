Red, red wine goes to my head,  
Makes me forget that I still need her so  
  
Red, red wine, it's up to you  
All I can do I've done  
Memories won't go, memories won't go  
  
Life is fine every time,  
Thoughts of you leave my head  
I was wrong, now I find  
Just one thing makes me forget  
  
Red, red wine, stay close to me  
Don't let me be alone  
It's tearing apart my blue heart  
  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,  
You keep me rockin' all of the time  
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand,  
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand  
Red red wine, you make me feel so sad,  
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
  
Red red wine, you give me holy pahzing  
Holy pahzing, you make me do my own thing  
Red red wine, you give me not awful love  
Your kind of lovin' like a blessing from above  
Red red wine, I loved you right from the start,  
Right from the start, and with all of my heart  
Red red wine in an eighties style  
Red red wine in a modern beat style  
Yeah  
  
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind  
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind  
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine  
You make me feel fine all of the time  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
The line broke, the money get choked,  
Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat  
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you,  
Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth  
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you till I die,  
Love you till I die, and that's no lie  
Red red wine, can't get your off my mind  
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find,  
I'll surely find. Make no fuss, just leave us
