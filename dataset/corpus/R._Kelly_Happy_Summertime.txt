Happy summertime Niggas ahh yeah

Come here girl let me push up on ya

Big chips at the bar spending  
GT with the wheels spinning  
Let's get somewhere and get high  
For the rest of the night  
Sex and then gone get a bite  
Oh take with a thug baby and if you want it (if you want it)  
You can get it pumping
