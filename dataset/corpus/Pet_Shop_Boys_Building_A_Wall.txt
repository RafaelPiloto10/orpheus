[Repeat: x2]  
Protection (prevention)  
Detection (detention)  
There's no where to defect to any more  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I'm building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
Back then on a bomb site  
We were spies among the ruins  
Such precocious barbarians  
On TV we saw  
Cold War

Protection (prevention)  
Detection (detention)  
There's no where to defect to any more  
  
I'm leaving the world  
It's all wrong  
Not so much what many are doing  
Much more what's within us  
  
I'm building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
Jesus and the man from Angol  
Caesar conquered Gaul  
Scouting for Centurians  
On a Roman war  
  
Through the woods, the trees  
And further on, the sea  
We lived in the shadow of the wall  
Sand in the sandwiches  
Wasps in the tea  
It was a free country  
(who do you think you are, Captain Britain?)  
  
I'm building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
I'm losing my head  
Well, why not?  
More work for the undertaker  
Means there's less for me  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I'm building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in
