Candles burnin' low  
Lots of Mistletoe  
Lots of snow and ice  
Everywhere we go  
Chior singing carrols  
Right outside my door  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I see your smilin' face  
Like I've never seen before  
Though I love you madly  
It seems I love you more  
The little cards you give me  
Will touch my heart for sure  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I feel like runnin' wild  
Those angels and a little child - hay hay hay  
I got you 'neath the misltetoe  
I kiss you once and then some more  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
And a happy happy New Year - ooooohhhhhh  
Let's deck the halls with holly  
Singing "Silent Night"  
Fill the trees with angels hair  
Pretty pretty lights  
Go to sleep and wake up  
Just before daylight  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love -ohoohoohooho
