My new purple shoes  
Been amazin' the people next door  
And my rock 'n roll forty fives  
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor  
  
I got a way with the girls on my block  
Try my best to be a real individual  
And when we go down to smokies and rock  
They line up like it's some kind of ritual  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place  
  
I like the good things in life  
But most of the best things ain't free  
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife  
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy  
Young and you're crazy...  
  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place
