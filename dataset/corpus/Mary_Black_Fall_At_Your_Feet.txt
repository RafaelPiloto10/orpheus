I'm really close tonight  
I feel like I'm moving inside him  
Lying in the dark  
I think that I'm beginning to know him  
Let it go  
I'll be there when you call  
  
Chorus  
  
And whenever I fall at your feet  
Won't you let your tears rain down one me  
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain  
  
Don't hide it from me now  
There's something in the way that you're talking  
Words don't sound right  
I hear them all moving inside you  
You know - I'll be waiting when you call  
  
Chorus  
  
The finger of blame has turning upon itself  
And I'm more than willing to offer myself  
Do you want my presence or need my help?  
Who knows where that might lead  
I fall, I fall  
  
Chorus
