The concentration drifts in out of me  
Conversation slides away  
Turn and face the change in apathy  
Take a rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Slave or sympathy, it atrophies  
Save but ancient hearts  
Hiding scars and knives in symphonies  
Still we rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust
