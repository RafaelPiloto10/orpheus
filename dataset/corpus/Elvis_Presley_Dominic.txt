Dominic, Dominic why are you stallin'  
Don't you hear love callin' to you  
Moo, moo, move your little foot do  
  
Dominic, Dominic pick one of them ticker  
There's acres and acres to choose  
Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse  
  
I, I, if I had your trouble  
Life would be double good sweet  
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet  
  
Listen Dominic, Dominic when will you hunger  
You ain't gettin' younger my friend  
Love, love, love 'em all right to the end  
  
I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn  
It's time to take the old bull by the horn  
Come on Dominic, Dominic, they're itchin' and twitchin'  
Better start pickin' some woo  
Moo, moo, move your little foot do!
