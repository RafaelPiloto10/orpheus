I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' 'bout half past dead  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"  
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No" was all he said  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Picked up my bag, went lookin' for a place to hide  
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side  
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown"  
She said, "I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say  
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day  
"Well Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"  
He said, "Do me a favour, son, won't you stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog  
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog"  
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, I'm a peaceful man"  
He said, "That's OK, just feed him when you can"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time  
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one  
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me
