One life to live  
No time to pretend  
No wins no loss  
No heroes in the end  
No dreams no plans no promises  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights  
One kiss  
One softly whispered yes  
No talk oh no, no tears  
No hearts to repossess  
No names no chains no hostages  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights  
Slip under the cover  
Of the night  
Young lover, young lover, young lover  
Everything's all right  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights
