Crazy as I may  
Make my way  
Through this world  
It's for no one but me to say  
Which direction I should turn in  
  
Because I am the captain of this ship  
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips  
The same as it was  
We should be forever again  
You give  
But you don't know  
Away you give  
And you  
You give  
To roll me back again  
You give  
For me again  
You leave  
  
And people say  
Oh look at the way  
The girl dances her life away  
Oh even more then that  
All the crazy, crazy things she does  
  
She sings  
I am the captain of this ship  
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips  
Just the same as it was  
Away to me  
And I  
Coming back to you  
  
Why should I  
Bend myself around to make you smile  
Why should I  
Wear your blinders to give you style  
Why should I compromise my high  
So that you can  
You give and roll  
The hand is back again  
And reign me along  
You give, play  
I won't be here too long  
You give  
So wait and see  
Waiting me along  
You give the reigns  
To roll me back again  
You give  
Play me around  
You give  
And why, why  
You give, play  
Play me again  
By your side  
We're the same as we were  
And wait  
Dance, dance, do your thing  
You while away
