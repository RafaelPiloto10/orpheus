You can count on me, girl  
You can count on me  
I won't ever let you down  
You can count on me  
  
You say you want a working man  
To bring the money home  
Someone to be good to you  
And never do you wrong  
  
A man that wants to settle down  
And put his feet on solid ground  
You want a love that's safe and sound  
You can count on me  
  
You say you're looking for a man  
To be there when you call  
Someone who will stand by you  
And never let you fall  
  
A man that you can call your own  
A man that you can trust alone  
To love when the children's grown  
You can count on me
