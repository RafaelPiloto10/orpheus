want to learn how to tie your shoes?  
It's a very easy thing to do  
Just sit on down and I'll give you the scoop  
What's that?  
It's called the loop de loop  
You gotta take a lace in each hand  
You go over and under again  
You make a loop de loop and pull  
And your shoes are looking cool  
You go over and back, left to right  
Loop de loop and you pull them tight  
Like bunny ears or a Christmas bow  
Lace them up and you're ready to go  
You make a loop de loop and pull  
And your shoes are looking cool  
You make the loop de loop and pull  
And your shoes are looking cool
