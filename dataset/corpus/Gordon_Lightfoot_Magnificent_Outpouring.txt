It is said that all the good things  
Must come to him who can pretend  
He doesn't have to wait  
For as surely as the light of day  
Must come to drive the night away  
The needles and the pins  
That's where the line begins  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds  
  
There are times when I have told you  
That there must be two of us  
To try to work things out  
But if I can't see you every day  
Then I must hide my thoughts away  
And see you when I can  
And try to understand  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds  
  
So let us treat our love likeany game  
To fan the flames would really be a sin  
For as surely as the snow must fall  
I shall be waiting for your call  
Pretending it is spring  
And you'll be mine again  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds
