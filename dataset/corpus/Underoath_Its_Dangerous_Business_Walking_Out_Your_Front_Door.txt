I've been up at this all night long  
I've been drowning in my sleep  
I've prayed for your safe place  
And its time for us to leave  
  
Time is running on empty and the gas is running out  
I've decided that tonight is the night  
That I set love aside  
Full speed ahead this seems to be the place  
I've seen this once before  
Planned perfection sought in my dreams  
Hoping this would take you home  
  
My knuckles have turned to white  
There's no turning back tonight  
So kiss me one last time  
  
Around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow  
The people will all gather  
To remember such a day where the flames grew as high  
As trees  
And the world stopped for you and me  
  
My knuckles have turned white  
There's no turning back tonight  
So hold on tight  
Kiss me one last time  
Shut your eyes  
  
I will now bring new meaning to the word alone  
Endless nights of dreaming of life  
And the days we should have spent here  
  
Drowning in my sleep I'm drowning in my sleep  
  
Glass shatters and comes to a halt  
I thought we'd be there by now  
I thought it would be so much quicker than this  
  
Pain has never been so brilliant  
I made sure you were buckled in  
Now you can walk hand in hand with him
