Every night it's the same  
I hear you callin' my name  
You're lyin' next to me  
I give into your charms  
You disappear in my arms  
I realize it's just a dream, but  
  
[Chorus]  
Desperately, I long to feel your touch  
But you left me all alone in love  
  
And now I  
Shake the sleep from my head  
And try to crawl out of bed  
Today is just another day  
I make the coffee for one  
I turn the radio on  
Pretend that everything's ok, but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now I  
Know there's no reason to smile  
It's gonna take me awhile  
'Cause I still love you desperately  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now I  
Watch the sun goin' down  
There ain't nobody around  
I feel a night in the breeze  
I keep on tellin' myself  
I don't need nobody else  
And I can do as I please, but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now  
Every night it's the same  
I hear you callin' my name  
I still love you desperately  
I still love you  
I still want you  
I still love you desperately
