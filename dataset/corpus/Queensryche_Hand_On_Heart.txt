All eyes were staring  
You floated through the room.  
Armed with your razor smile  
Cutting to the bone.  
My voice fell useless  
You flashed a quick "hello."  
Feeling the fool,  
Could you tell it showed?  
  
But that was "sometime ago."  
A memory vague and fading slow,  
Of somewhere I'd been.  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and choice, will keep us together.  
  
I don't know if I,  
Can reach that high.  
It's a long way to fall  
Hauntingly holding  
My fate with a gaze.  
Like a child, mesmerized  
By the candle's flame.  
Oh what lies behind those eyes  
I could only guess.  
That certain way you stood  
Apart from the rest.  
  
Now where is "sometime ago?"  
When everything moved in slo-motion.  
Caught by my watering eye  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising, I'll never go.  
Hand on heart  
For reasons you'll never know.  
  
Together through thick and thin  
Lose or win, I'll be there for you.  
Strange how the mind changes  
Time and time again.  
Things once important, now  
Pale in comparison.  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising, I'll never go.  
Hand on heart  
For reasons you'll never know.  
  
I promise girl, hand on heart.
