Come and rest here  
Come and lay your burdens down  
Come and rest here  
There is refuge for you now  
  
You'll find His peace  
And know you're not alone anymore  
He is near  
You'll find His healing  
You're heart isn't shattered anymore  
He is here  
  
Breathe in  
Breathe out  
You will  
You will find Him here  
  
I will rest in You  
  
You will find Him  
You will find Him here  
You will find Him  
You will find Him here
