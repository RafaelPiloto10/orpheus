There' s nothing I would rather do,  
Take my praise to You,  
Cause Your love brought me to this place  
And I, just can' t contain my praise  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m gonna tell the whole world,  
That there' s no one else like you,  
Jesus You are the one for me  
I' m gonna shout you' re praises  
And tell of all the things you' ve done  
Jesus You are the one for me  
  
There' s something I just have to do,  
That is to lift my hands to You,  
Coz Your love has brought me to this place,  
And I, just can' t contain my praise  
  
(repeat chorus)  
You' re the one for me,  
Jesus you are the one for me,  
You' re the one for me,  
You' re everything I need
