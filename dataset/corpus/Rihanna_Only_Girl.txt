[Verse:]  
I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride Be thinking of me, doin' what you
like  
So boy forget about the world cuz it's gonna be me and you tonight  
I wanna make a bed for ya, then imma make you swallow your pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world  
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love  
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only girl in the world...  
Like I'm the only one that's in command  
Cuz I'm the only one who understands I will make you feel like a man  
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world  
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love  
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only one...  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Want you to take it like a thief in the night  
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right  
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin', you can come inside  
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world  
  
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love  
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only girl in the world...  
Like I'm the only one that's in command  
Cuz I'm the only one who understands, like I'm the only one who knows your
heart, only one...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Take me for a ride  
Oh baby, take me high  
Let me make you rise Oh make it last all night  
Take me for a ride  
Oh baby, take me high  
Let me make you rise  
Make it last all night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world  
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love  
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only girl in the world...  
Like I'm the only one that's in command  
Cuz I'm the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man  
Only girl in the world...  
Girl in the world...  
Only girl in the world...  
Girl in the world...
