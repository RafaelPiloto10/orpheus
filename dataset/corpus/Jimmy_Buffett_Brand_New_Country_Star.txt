Well, he out grew his sequin suit  
Sold his Trailways bus  
Let his hair get a little too long  
Duck tails bit the dust  
His custom made, pearl inlaid guitar  
slipped from his hands  
And in it's place a new electrical one  
He had flown in from Japan  
  
'Cause he's a cheeseburger eatin'  
Abandoned Sunday meetin'  
Brand new country star  
He rides around in a Lincoln Continental  
No steer horns on his car  
Oh the record man say he's the livin' end  
They're gonna spin him right to the top  
Yea, he's a hot roman candle from the Texas panhandle  
  
He can either go country or pop  
Got a good ole' friend name of Texas Ben  
Tells him all the spots to play  
And a sweet little lady, he calls her sexy Sadie  
She's with the boy night and day  
They're gonna open up a chain of fancy bowling lanes  
The first one in his old home town  
And on ribbon cutting day they'll come from miles away  
The folks will all gather round
