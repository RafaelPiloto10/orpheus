Lord, I am not my own, no longer my own,  
Living now for You, and everything I think  
All I say and do is for You, my Lord.  
  
Now, taking up the cross, walking on Your paths,  
Holding out Your truth running in this race,  
Bowing every day, all for You, my Lord.  
  
And what I have vowed I will make good.  
Every promise made will be fulfilled  
'Till the day I die, every day I live  
Is for You, is for You, is for You,  
Is for You, is for You, is for You,  
  
Earth has nothing I desire that lives outside of You,  
I'm consumed with You. Treasures have no hold,  
Nothing else will do, only You, my Lord.
