Well, it's happening  
Never planned on this  
You've got something I need  
Kind of dangerous  
And I'm losing control  
I'm not used to this  
What you want from me  
I'm not used to this  
  
I can't shut it off  
This thing I've begun  
And it's hard to tell  
Just where it's coming from  
And it's hard to see  
What I'm capable of  
And it's hard to believe  
Just what I've become  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, can we stop?  
Me, I'm not  
Hey, can we stop?  
Me, I'm not  
Hey, can we stop?  
Me, I'm not  
Hey, can we stop?  
Me, I'm not  
  
I can swallow it down  
Keep it all inside  
I define myself  
By how well I hide  
I feel it coming apart  
Well, at least I tried  
I can win this war  
By knowing not to fight  
  
If I take it all back  
Someway, somehow  
If I knew back then  
What I know right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)  
  
(Me, I'm not)
