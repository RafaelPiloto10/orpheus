The mama pajama rolled out a bed  
And she ran to the police station  
When the papa found out he began to shout  
  
And he started the investigation  
It's against the law  
It was against the law  
What the mama saw  
It was against the law.  
  
The mama look down and spit on the ground  
Every time my name gets mentioned  
The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy,  
I'm gonna stick him the house of detention."  
Well I'm on my way.  
I don't know where I'm going  
I'm on my way I'm taking my time  
But I don't know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you, me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you, me and Julio down by the school yard  
  
In a couple of days they come and  
Take me away  
But the press let the story leak  
And when the radical priest  
Come to get me released  
We was all on the cover of Newsweek  
  
And I'm on my way  
I don't know where I'm going  
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time  
But I don't know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you, me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard
