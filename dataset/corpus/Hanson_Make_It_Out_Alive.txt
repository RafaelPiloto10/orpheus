The more I love you  
The more I believe in you  
The more I need you  
The more I'm needed too  
And I surrender  
What I thought I knew  
The look in your eyes  
I know my games are through  
  
'Cos you've been holding on  
And I've been holding back  
  
[Chorus]  
We may not make it out alive  
Whoa  
What does it matter if you're here by my side?  
We may not make it out alive  
What does it matter?  
It's just a matter of time  
  
The resignation sneaking up on me  
Was I mistaken to let you get to me?  
Overtaken in ways I've never known  
So please don't break me  
We've still got a ways to go  
  
'Cos we're still holding on  
Just hoping for the best  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just a matter of time  
  
This memories that we've got  
Do not amount to much  
But I'm so glad that we've got them  
We cannot be what we're not  
But it's too late to get  
Or she'd a tear for the doubt  
Oh yeah  
  
We're just holding on  
Bracing for the worst  
Yeah  
Come on girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just a matter of time  
Oh yeah
