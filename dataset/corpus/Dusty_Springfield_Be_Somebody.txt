I can tell by lookin' in your eyes, yea man  
There is something on your mind  
Restless so long  
It's time to let you go  
There's a dream out there  
I know you got to find  
So, if you take the love that I will give to you  
Then I won't feel like I'm losin' you  
  
I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Be somebody strong  
To me, you'll always be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
You'll never do wrong  
Never do wrong  
Always be strong, strong, oh  
Be strong, yeah  
  
People change  
It happens all the time  
Still, it hurts to say goodbye  
So, if my tears are gettin' in your way  
I'm imagining how your wings learn to fly  
So, shine your light for all the world to see  
Share the love you feel  
But save the best for me  
  
I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Be somebody strong  
To me, you'll always be somebody  
Ooh, you can be somebody  
You'll never do wrong  
Always be strong  
  
If you need me you can count on me  
I know, I know  
You can be somebody, ooh  
You can be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Ooh, somebody strong  
In my heart you'll always be somebody, oh  
You can be somebody  
I know it, I know it, I know it  
Oh, you'll never do wrong  
You can fly, you can fly, oh, fly
