Don't like goodbyes, tears or sighs  
I'm not too good at leavin' time  
I got no taste for grievin' time, no, no, not me  
You've been my near ones, always my dear ones  
I never thought that I would find  
Another love, a different kind but it came to be  
Well, if you think I'm tellin' you lies  
Go try your luck and look into her eyes  
But remember, you must remember she's mine  
And my world overhead has a clear new shine  
Don't want to leave you, sorry to grieve you  
It's travelin' time and I must move on  
Found the girl to lean upon  
And if I could arrange it  
Would I care to change it? Not me
