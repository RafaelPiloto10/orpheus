Agnetha We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie  
So what's the use to pretend  
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy  
You've got to face it my friend  
  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
  
How I love you, girl  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see  
That's the way we whirl  
You had your hopes and your high expectations  
  
Somehow it doesn't seem right  
I'm getting fed-up with your acquisitions  
I'm not your angel in white  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
We're gonna make it together  
  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
How I love you, girl  
  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see  
That's the way we whirl  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss
