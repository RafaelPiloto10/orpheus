CHORUS:  
Boys go and shine up your shoes  
Girls run and powder your nose  
?Cause tonight you'll be shakin?  
From your head down to your toes  
Well feeling you're cool is as good as lookin? it  
Thinkin? your?re cool is as good as knowin? it  
Playin? it cool is as good as blowin? it  
You know you can't spend a dollar  
If you ain't got a dime  
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
So go read up your books and sharpen your hooks  
Then all you need is money and a mouth full of honey  
And if you play your cards right after dancin? all night  
You won't have to walk home alone  
You won't have to walk home alone  
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool  
But if that lady has a love noose  
She might never let you go  
And if you think that maybe you're too young  
And you just can not cope  
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears  
And cut a hole right in the rope  
Snip a hole right in the rope  
Chorus  
Well feeling you're cool is as good as lookin? it  
Thinkin? your?re cool is as good as knowin? it  
Playin? it cool is as good as blowin? it  
You know you can't spend a dollar  
If you ain't got a dime  
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning  
You can't remember what you did  
Just ring up some of your friends  
And they'll tell you just how low you slid  
Oh don't be ashamed of anything you hear  
After all you can't be blame  
When you're drinking so much beer  
Hey don't you worry  
That what you did just wasn't right  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night  
Chorus x 4
