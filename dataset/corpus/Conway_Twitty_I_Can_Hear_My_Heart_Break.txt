I'm surrounded by silence tormented by dreams  
Tortured by sweet words that you didn't mean  
It's the stillness it's the silence that I can hardly take  
For I can hear I can hear my heart break.  
  
Now these arms are mighty lonesome guess they're missing you  
And I have to admit it honey I miss you too  
I sit here in the silence half asleep half awake  
And I can hear I can hear my heart break.  
  
Empty days without number lonely nights I can't bear  
That old world's gone right on by me who's to know who's to care  
I keep listening for your footsteps little sound you used to make  
And I can hear I can hear my heart break.  
  
My heart break...
