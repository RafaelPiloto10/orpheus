Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you no  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleepin'  
Every dream I dream is you somehow  
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me  
Well darlin' I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you  
It's no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
  
Have I told you how the nights are long  
When you're not with me  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you  
It's no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
My sweet darling, I'm telling you now.  
Darling, I'm telling you now.
