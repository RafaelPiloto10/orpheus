I want more than me and you  
The more I want the more it scares me  
I will put my faith in you  
won't you be my missionary  
I can't ... can't get back to the baseline  
Had too much of waiting up  
Had too much of things I tell you  
It's the only way and it's love  
Fill my cup oh I've said too much  
I can't... can't get back to the baseline (2x)  
I've been on freight train buzz  
So I'm trying to tell you  
the only thing I need is your love  
But I can't...(4x)  
I can't back to the baseline  
It's the way of feeling good  
It is all that's necessary  
I guess that it's from above  
I'm no fool but I guess too much  
I can't... can't get back to the baseline (2x)  
(Repeat chorus)  
Fare you well and I will choose  
When I've found it I will tell you  
I belong to the same as you  
won't you be my missionary  
I can't... can't get back to the baseline (2x)
