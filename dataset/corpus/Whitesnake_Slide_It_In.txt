You talk too much, never saying what's on your mind,  
It's written on your face, I lead the world you hide behind.  
I know what you want, I can see what you're looking for,  
I know what you want from me,  
An' I'm gonna give you more.  
  
I'm gonna slide it in right to the top,  
Slide it in, I ain't never gonna stop.  
Slide it in, right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in, slide it, in baby.  
  
Sometimes you seem just like a stranger to me,  
But, all the games you play make it so easy to see.  
You're looking for love, tho' you try to deny,  
The things you put me through  
Tell me what I've got to do to you.  
I'm gonna slide it in, right to the top,  
Slide it in, I ain't never gonna stop.  
Slide it in, right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in.  
  
You talk too much, always treating me so unkind,  
I know what I've got to do, to get me some peace of mind.  
  
I'm gonna slide it in, right to the top,  
Slide it in, I ain't never gonna stop.  
Slide it in, right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in,  
Slide it in, right to the top.  
Slide it in, I ain't never gonna stop.  
Slide it in, right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in, slide it, slide it in, slide it in, right
to the top, baby.
