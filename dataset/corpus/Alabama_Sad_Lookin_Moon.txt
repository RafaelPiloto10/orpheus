Written by randy owen, teddy gentry, and greg fowler  
I thought that you could fly, i thought that you had wings  
I guess that i believed you'd never say goodbye  
But my world stopped turnin' 'round, the stars turned upside down  
It knocked me to the ground on my knees  
  
[Chorus]  
Now there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me  
There's a sad lookin' sky as far as i can see  
I always believed and i thought the stars could see  
But there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me  
  
I shared with you my dreams, i gave you everything  
I opened up my heart and i gave you my ring  
Well i spent days and nights just thinkin' about the time  
When you would be mine all my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a sad lookin' moon  
A sad lookin' moon  
There's a sad lookin' moon  
Shinin' down on me
