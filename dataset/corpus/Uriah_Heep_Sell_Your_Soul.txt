I got a solid silver reason  
I got something you'll never buy  
I've spent my life playing rock 'n' roll  
I wouldn't tell a lie  
  
Well, if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
There's a thunder, see it and wonder  
How to play the game, it's easy  
  
You know, we're gonna live forever  
You know we're never gonna die  
You see it's written across the sky tonight  
I'm gonna tell you why  
  
Because they've covered up the exits  
We got a spotlight just for you  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Hear me calling, stars are falling  
Taking me away  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Stand up, shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up, shout it out  
Rock 'n' roll  
  
Can't you feel we're gettin' stronger  
gettin' stronger every day  
There ain't nothing gonna stop us  
Oh, there ain't no way  
  
It's like a rolling ball of thunder  
You know, it's never gonna stop  
You know, it's gonna drag you under  
See me soaring, thunders roaring  
Things afraid again  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Stand up, shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up, shout it out  
Rock 'n' roll  
  
I got a solid silver reason  
I got something you'll never buy  
I've spent my life with rock 'n' roll  
Oh no, would I lie?  
  
But if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
There's a thunder, see it and wonder  
How to play the game, it's easy  
  
It's gonna drag you under  
Gonna take your heart and soul  
You gotta stand up  
You gotta shout, shout, shout, shout, shout it out  
?
