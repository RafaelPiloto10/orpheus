Look at yourself...  
If you had sense of humor  
You would laugh to beat the band...  
Look at yourself  
Do you still believe the rumor  
That romance is simply grand?  
Since you took it right on the chin  
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin  
My mental state is all a-jumble  
I sit around in sadly mumble  
Fools rush in, so here I am!  
Very glad to be unhappy  
I can't win, but here I am  
More than glad to be unhappy  
Unrequited love's a bore and I've got it pretty bad  
But for someone you adore  
It's a pleasure to be sad...  
Like a straying baby lamb  
With no mammy and no pappy  
I'm so unhappy  
But, oh, so glad!
