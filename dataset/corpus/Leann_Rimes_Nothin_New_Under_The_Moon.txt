Nowhere to go  
All night took everything  
Another nice try with Mr. Wrong  
Late night TV on my horizon

Just one more night to get through

Same old dance, same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
But there was nothing new under the moon, 'till you

Nothin' new under the moon, 'till you  
Nothin' new under the moon  
  
There was nothing new under the moon, 'till you
