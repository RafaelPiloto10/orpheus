The train was leaving at 10 after 10  
I got to the station just in time to check in  
I've been luggin' my bags all around  
I'm trying hard to never knock people down  
But I see I left a few on the ground  
And as the train pulls away I can hear the conductor say  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
I'm not to blame (echo)  
Right track wrong train... Train  
I read my schedule but my train wasn't there  
They read my ticket, it said going nowhere  
Everybody had the same tatooed face  
All the women and men just dressed in lace  
Oh I gotta get out of this place  
Should got off before the engineer locked the door  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
I'm not to blame (echo)  
Right track wrong train, train train train hey!  
"Hey that's a neat tatoo you're wearing. By the way where'd you get it?  
Uh huh. Say is this an express train? Uh huh.  
Snack bar? Uh huh. Uh huh. "  
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv?  
Another empty town fading to gray  
Another open home sign on the way  
Have a cup of coffee, have a nice day  
And as the train pushes off,  
We're headed for Babylon  
Oh no...  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train...  
On the wrong train on the right track  
We don't know if she'll ever come back  
(Talking) What train is this?  
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv?  
Have a cup of coffe, have a nice day (talking)  
"Yeah, yeah I'll be right there yeah. I'm gonna get the next train  
Yeah. "
