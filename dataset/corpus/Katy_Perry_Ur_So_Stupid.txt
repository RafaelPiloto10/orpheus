I hope you hang yourself with your stupid scarf  
While jacking off listening to Mozart  
You mean and moan about L. A.  
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway  
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars  
You're so indie rock it's almost an art  
You need money  
Just to stay alive  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
  
You're so mad maybe you should buy a big mac  
You're so skinny you should really super size the deal  
Secretly you you're so amused  
And nobody understands you  
I'm so mean cuz cannot get you out of your head  
I'm so angry cuz you'd rather my space instead  
I can't believe I fell in love  
With someone that wears more make up and  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
Oh, oh, oh  
Do, do, do, do, bop, bop, bow  
Do, do, do, bop, bop. Day  
You're so stupid, you're so stupid  
  
You walking around like you're oh so debonair  
You pull them down and there's really nothing there  
I wish you would just be real with me  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like...  
Boys.  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no, no, no, no, no, no
