Oh oh  
Last year's old news  
I'm breaking out my six string  
And playing from my heart  
It's not deja vu  
Cause it's another summer  
That's how this chapter starts  
  
I'm gonna run so fast til I can't breathe  
Come along and follow me  
Let's make some noise like we never did before  
  
It's a brand new day  
(Don't you see me)  
Changing on my way  
(So completely)  
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it  
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit  
It's a brand new day  
And I'm feelin' good  
And I'm feelin' good  
  
So drama free (so drama free)  
I'm all about the music  
I just wanna sing  
Watch me live out my dreams  
I'm gonna rock that stage and give my everything  
  
I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move  
Come along get in the groove  
Let's shine so brighter than we did before  
  
It's a brand new day  
(Don't you see me)  
Changing on my way  
(So completely)  
This time I'm a sing and your gonna hear it  
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit  
It's a brand new day  
And I'm feelin' good!  
  
(Whatcha whatcha gonna do, whatcha whatcha gonna do)  
I'm gonna laugh through the summer with you  
(Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be?)  
You'll just have to watch me carefully  
(Where ya gonna go? Where ya gonna go?)  
Anywhere my heart wants me to go  
  
I'm a sing I'm a dance I'm a write I'm a play  
I'm a gonna try my game in everything  
  
'Cause it's a brand new day  
(Don't you see me)  
Changing on my way  
(So completely)  
This time I'm a sing and your gonna hear it  
This time I'm gonna show you I got the spirit  
It's a brand new day  
  
It's a brand new day  
(Don't you see me)  
Changing on my way  
(So completely)  
This time I'm a sing and your gonna hear  
This time I'm gonna show you I got the spirit  
It's a brand new day  
It's a brand new day  
And I'm feelin' good  
Feelin' good  
And I'm feelin' good
