1974  
I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old  
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be  
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark  
Keeping other dogs like him for company  
  
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town  
Try to get some bread to make another way  
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow  
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day  
  
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73  
When I heard somebody call outside my door  
Said "Are you friend or are you foe"  
He looked up and he said "no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more"  
  
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
Need a friend  
Need a friend
