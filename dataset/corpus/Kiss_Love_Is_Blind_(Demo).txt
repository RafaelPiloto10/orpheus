Your eyes had a welcome sign  
Your lips said you'd be mine  
You came and I knew it all the time  
  
Your name I don't recall  
I never knew you at all  
I hope I'm not the best that you didn't find  
  
Oh, love is blind  
Love is blind  
You're looking for love  
I don't have the time, oh  
  
No promises, no lies  
The truth lies in your eyes  
I want you and you want me  
  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
You're looking for love  
I don't have the time, no  
  
Love is blind  
Yeah, love is blind  
I'm not looking for love  
But don't leave me behind  
  
Love is blind  
Love is blind, yeah  
You're looking for love  
I don't have the time  
  
Oh, love, love  
Love is blind, ooh  
Love is blind, ooh
