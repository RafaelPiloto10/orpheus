My mama showed me how to rock in the cradle  
But I learned how to roll along  
My papa said "son, gotta git some fun  
Cos when you're old it ain't too good on your own"  
Been so long, since you heard my song  
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play  
Felt so bad when I had to leave you  
But, I knew that I'd be back some day  
  
So I'm comin' home  
To give you more than you bargained for  
Comin' home  
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver 'n' shake  
Comin' home  
Gonna rock 'n' roll an' give you my soul  
Comin' home  
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again  
  
Groovin' to American Bandstand  
B.B. onstage with 'Lucille'  
The thrill is gone, but it won't be for long  
Cos you know I like to play how I feel  
Now that we're all back together  
Gonna shiver 'n' shake all night  
I just gotta say, the music I play  
Will sure 'nough make you feel alright  
  
Tho' I learned how to rock in the cradle  
An' rollin' came so easy to me  
All the years I travelled the world  
Made it so clear to see  
It's been so long since you heard my song  
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play  
Felt so bad when I had to leave you  
But I knew that I'd be back some day  
  
Comin' home  
To give you more than you bargained for  
Comin' home  
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver and shake  
Comin' home  
Gonna rock 'n' roll and give you my soul  
Comin' home  
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again  
Comin' home  
Shiver 'n' shakin', anticpatin'  
Comin' home  
The thrill is gone but it won't be for long
