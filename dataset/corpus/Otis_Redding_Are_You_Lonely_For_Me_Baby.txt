Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
  
It's my last train, y'all, Jacksonville  
I gotta get on it, baby, you know I will now  
Will you try? Just come on and try  
To forget all the pain that I brought you  
  
Go on and cry, go ahead and just cry, cry, baby  
I know I'm the one who, who, who taught you, yeah  
  
To be lonely, baby  
I'm lonely and blue  
Hey, I'm lonely, baby  
And I'm lonely for you  
  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
  
It's your last buck to Jacksonville  
Are you my sweet baby, are you still?  
I'll tell my friend it's the end  
That you'll never again desert me  
  
That man is going laughing  
I can just hear him laugh, honey  
H would say that I was wrong to just hurt you  
But he's lying, baby, and then I'm sorry too  
  
Yeah, I'm lonely, baby  
Yes, I'm lonely for you, yeah, that's strange  
  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely, lonely for me, baby now?  
  
It's a long ride to Jacksonville  
But no one will ever know the way I feel  
Will you be there, baby, will you just be there?  
When I, when I, when I, when I get down from that train, girl?  
  
Yes, I'm gonna be there  
Said I'm gonna be there  
You know I got to be there  
'Cause I wanna see you there  
  
Oh, I'm lonely, baby  
Lonely and blue  
Yeah, and I'm lonely, baby  
I'm lonely for you  
  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Are you lonely for me, baby?  
Come on home to me, baby
