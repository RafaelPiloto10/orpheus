Outside the leaves are slowly falling from the trees  
Black clouds are moving in, a storm is coming on  
Inside the confessional, Angel and I are playing games  
I'm acting the priest, and she is the sinner of all my dreams...  
Dreams, dreams, turn into a nightmare  
A sudden change on her face, her smile is gone without a trace  
"Nothing... nothing is forever", she said  
"So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear  
A year ago... I signed a sacred pact, and if you love me so will you"  
Then she told me of the Pact, her tears were not an act  
And they were not alone, all my dreams... shattered to the bone  
I fell to my knees in prayer... but ohhh this is Hell  
The Pact is so powerful, it leaves you no way out  
Unless within a year, someone else will sign it in blood  
Someone to take your place, to guard this evil church  
Another wolf to roam the hills, another wolf... in for the kill  
"Nothing... nothing is forever", she said  
"So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear  
A year ago... I signed a sacred Pact"  
If i sign it now, Angel will be free to go  
She must leave without her memory, no more a wolf, but as a lady  
And if I don't, then in seven days she will die before my very eyes  
Either way... I'll never see her again  
If i sign then I must stay, and only leave as a wolf for prey  
"Nothing... nothing is forever", she said  
"So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear  
A year ago... I signed a sacred Pact"  
And now I'm signing it for you
