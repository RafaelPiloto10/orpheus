Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love,  
Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord,  
And where there's doubt, true faith in You  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring Your light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
For when we give, we will ourselves receive  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  
And in dying that we gain eternal life  
And in dying that we gain eternal life
