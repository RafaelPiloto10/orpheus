Goodbye Sam, hello Samantha  
Sam, I'm leaving the gang,  
So don't come around for me on Sunday  
Joe, I want you to know,  
I'll have to skip the game on Monday  
Had a whole lot of fun,  
But now the time is come  
I need the sweet, sweet touch of a woman's love Goodbye Sam, hello Samantha  
Goodbye Joe, hello Joanne  
Suddenly I need a new kind of company  
Someone to love me  
Goodbye Sam, hello Samantha  
Goodbye Lou, hello Louise  
From today, there'll be new games for me to play  
So good luck and goodbye Sam  
Guys, you ought to get wise,  
There's more to the world than pool and fishing  
Easy riding is fine, but look around,  
See what you're missing  
Girls are waiting in line and now has come the time  
I'm going out and I'm gonna get me some
