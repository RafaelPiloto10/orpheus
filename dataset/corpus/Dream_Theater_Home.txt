The Sleeper:  
Shine- lake of fire  
Lines take me higher  
My mind drips desire  
Confined and overtired  
  
Living this charade  
Is getting me nowhere  
I can't shake this charade  
The city's cold blood calls me home  
HomeIt's what I long for  
Back homewhere I belong  
  
The city- it calls to me  
Decadent scenes from my memory  
Sorrow- eternity  
My demons are coming to drown me  
  
Help- I'm falling, I'm crawling  
I can't keep away from its clutch  
Can't have it, this habit  
It's calling me back to my home  
  
The Miracle:  
I remember the first time she came to me  
Poured her soul out all night and cried  
  
I remember I was told there's a new love that's born  
For each one that has died  
  
I never thought that I  
Could carry on with this life  
But I can't resist myself  
No matter how hard I try  
  
Living their other life  
Is getting them nowhere  
I'll make her my wife  
Her sweet temptation calls me home  
HomeIt's what I long for  
My homewhere she belongs  
  
Her ecstasy- means so much to me  
Even decieving my own blood  
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles  
She's taking me to my home  
  
Help- he's my brother, but I love her  
I can't keep away from her touch  
Deception, dishonor  
It's calling me back to my home  
  
Nicholas:  
Her story- it holds the key  
Unlocking dreams from my memory  
Solving this mystery  
Is everything that is a part of me  
  
Help- regression, obsession  
I can't keep away from her touch  
Leave no doubt, to find out  
It's calling me back to my home
