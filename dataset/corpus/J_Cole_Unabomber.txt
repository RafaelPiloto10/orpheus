[Intro:]  
Yeah  
Fresh off the motherf-cking broadcast  
And I'm here, fuego nigga  
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast  
Yeah, uh  
  
[Verse:]  
I told niggas on the low, but they ain't hear it though  
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle  
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow  
We eating better than we was a few years ago  
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's May day  
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors  
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn't fade us  
Bitch I made straight A's, go 'head, try and degrade us, haters  
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones  
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody's got a story dog  
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog  
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog  
With hits like a porno blog  
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour  
Ain't judging though, to each his own  
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home  
More power to you, but a message to you f-ck niggas  
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna f-ck with you  
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time  
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine  
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new  
Same old, f-ck it though, what's up with you?  
If you made it this far listening without skipping  
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting  
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission  
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position  
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen  
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate  
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!  
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping  
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?  
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life  
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right  
I find myself fiendin' for a spot to go at night  
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite  
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life  
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up over night (Boom!)  
  
[Outro:]  
Hey, yo, it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast  
All the drama that I had to get past  
Will it last? Or will it pass?  
Just as quick as it came  
Hoes knowing my name  
Dog, welcome to fame  
I pray to God we don't change  
But even if you don't  
Most niggas look at you strange  
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)  
Hey man it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast
