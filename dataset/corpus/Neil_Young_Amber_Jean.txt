Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
There's a moon so fine  
There for you, my Amber Jean.  
  
Still some lines  
That should get crossed  
Still some coins  
That might be tossed  
Still some love  
That hasn't been lost  
There for you, my Amber Jean.  
  
Amber Jean, oh, Amber Jean,  
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen.  
  
Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
There's a moon so fine  
There for you, my Amber Jean.
