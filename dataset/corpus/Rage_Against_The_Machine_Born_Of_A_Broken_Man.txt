My fears hunt me down  
Capturing my memories  
The frontier of loss  
They try to escape across the street where  
Jesus stripped bare  
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture  
In the name of my  
In the name of my  
  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
  
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him  
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within  
His thoughts like a hundred moths  
Trapped in a lampshade  
Somewhere within  
Their wings banging and burning  
On through endless night  
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving  
Praying for someone to turn off the light  
  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
  
My fear is hunting me down  
Capturing my memories  
The frontier of laos  
They try to escape across the street where  
Jesus stripped bare  
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture  
In the name of my  
In the name of my  
  
Yeah  
  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
