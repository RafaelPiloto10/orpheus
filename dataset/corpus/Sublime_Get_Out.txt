My place is not a home,  
don't make no difference  
but I have found that I need a place to stay,  
I never listen what bud lord man gotta say,  
  
You shoulda seen all the flops in my house  
We were jumpin on walls and kickin ceilings  
Nowadays people listen to me when I say get out,  
Hold me and don't let go  
Don't make no difference that your a hooker,  
I need a place to stay  
(disease is just the price I pay)  
  
That show it used to be,  
That girl is dead to me now,  
All the time people want to know  
The meaning of the name, anarchist?  
  
The shit you missed jot a m-mewloop with a peni twist,  
What you get is the kind  
No gank or cess with yellow lover  
On the d-are-you-m-s let the lovin' take a hold over me,  
cause all i see is this fussing and fighting  
In 1992 lets all try uniting
