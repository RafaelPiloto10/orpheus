First she says "Kings"  
Then he says "Aces"  
It gets pretty hard for a lady to tell  
The hearts from the faces  
  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me, to me, me  
  
I want to carry you across a threshold of fireflies  
And violet stones, all alone (all alone)  
Volcanic silver clouds fill pools and canyons around us  
All around (all around)  
  
But molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
  
So, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me, me, to me, me  
  
Molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
Yes, molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
  
So, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Oh, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home
