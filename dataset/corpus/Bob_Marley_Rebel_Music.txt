I, rebel music  
I, rebel music  
Why can't we roam this open country?  
Oh, why can't we be what we want to be?  
We want to be free  
  
Three o'clock roadblock, curfew  
And I've got to throw away  
Yes, I've got to throw away  
Yes, I've got to throw away  
My little herb stalk  
  
I, rebel music  
I, rebel music  
  
Take my soul and cuss me out  
Check my life if I am in doubt  
Three o'clock, roadblock  
And, hey, Mr. Cop, ain't got no  
(What you say down there?)  
Ain't got no birth certificate on me now
