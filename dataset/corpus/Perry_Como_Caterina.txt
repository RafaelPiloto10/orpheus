Caterina  
Oh! Ho! Ho!  
  
When we kiss, pretty miss, pretty miss, I'm in ecstasy  
Caterina  
Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!  
  
But when we kiss, pretty miss, pretty miss, are you thinking of me?  
Caterina  
Ah! Ha! Ha!  
Just how long is the list, is the list, of the lips you've kissed?  
  
Oh how happy my heart would be  
If I knew that you loved just me  
Say it's true  
Say you do
