[Verse 1]  
Grains of sand slip through your hands  
Never seasing time  
Fold your hands in silent prayer  
Eternal peace you'll find  
  
[Chorus]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let the rain falling on your face  
Run into your eyes  
Can you see the rainbow now  
Through the stormy skies  
  
[Chorus] [x2]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 3]  
Standing in the rising tide  
Heaven's light shines on you, on you, on you  
Test the sea rising at your feet  
How far can you go  
'Till you need God's helping hand  
To ride the undertoe  
  
[Chorus][x3]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity
