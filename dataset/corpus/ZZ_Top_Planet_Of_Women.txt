What can I do, I'm a nervous wreck?  
There's girls everywhere, I better go and check. CHECK IT OUT  
I can't tell a diamond from a hole in the ground.  
They all got my head spinning round and round.  
Planet of women, oh yeah.  
The planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane.  
  
They start by acting just a little discreet.  
Then they're in the skies and they're in the streets.  
You can find them in cars or a hotel lobby,  
they're easy to find, just look for a body.  
Planet of women, oh yeah.  
Just a planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane.  
  
If you have the answer, drop me a line today  
or send a straight jacket something in a shade of gray.  
I think I've sprained my brain 'cause it won't unwind.  
Every day it's man against man on the  
planet of women, oh yeah.  
Just a planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane,  
it's driving me insane.
