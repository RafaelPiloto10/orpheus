She's lost in the night  
She's out of my sight  
Gotta find her again  
She's out of my life  
Gotta find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Will I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow she's gone  
She's lost in the night  
Out of my sight  
Will I find her again  
Taken my life  
Have to find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the dawn  
How can I ever find her  
She's just a shadow  
Missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night, she's gone  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Can I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow, missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night  
She's lost in the night  
And I don't the reason  
Will I find her again  
She's out of my sight  
But I can't lose this feeling  
Will I find her again
