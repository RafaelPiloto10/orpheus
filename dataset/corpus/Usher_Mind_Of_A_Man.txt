[Usher]  
[Interlude]  
That night I said I was recording late  
I wasn't recording late  
I was just smokin' chillin' had a couple dranks  
Not much of anything  
That time I flew down to MIA  
Damn I went MIA  
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play  
And that ain't everything  
All I think about is bitches  
And everywhere I go they comin'  
Double standards that everybody talkin' bout  
The tables turned around I be throwin' up  
So I ain't tryna' justify
