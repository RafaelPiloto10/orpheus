Ah, you turn me on  
I've been the biggest fan of yours  
Ah, ah there's something more  
So much more baby  
  
Ah, I can't be cool  
It's getting stronger every day  
Well, yeah, pictures of you  
I cut them out, baby  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
  
I can't get enough  
Too hard a body drives me mad  
Oh yeah it's like a drug  
Suspender love, baby  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
  
Ah, ah, oh yeah  
Ah, ha, ah, ha, ha  
Oh baby yeah  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
