Elvis, white trash  
Elvis, the Memphis flash  
Elvis, didn't smoke hash  
Would've been a sissy without Johnny Cash  
  
Elvis, didn't dodge the draft  
Elvis, had his own aircraft  
Elvis, having a laugh  
On the Lisa Marie in a color photograph  
  
Elvis, under the hood  
Elvis, with Cadillac blood  
Elvis, darling bud  
Flowered and returned to the Mississippi mud  
  
Elvis, ain't gonna rot  
Elvis in a Memphis plot  
Elvis, he didn't hear the shot  
And Dr. King died just across the lot from  
  
Elvis, vanilla ice cream  
Elvis, girls of fourteen  
Elvis, the Memphis spleen  
Shooting tvs reading Corinthians' 13  
  
Elvis with God on his knees  
Elvis, owned three tvs  
Elvis, here come the killer bees  
Head full of honey, [Incomprehensible]  
  
Elvis, the bumper stickers  
Elvis, the white knickers  
Elvis, the white niggaare  
Ate at King Burger and just kept getting bigger  
  
Elvis, sang to win  
Elvis, the battle hymn  
Elvis, the battle to be slim  
Elvis ate America before America ate him
