She's crying a river, she helps everyone  
There is so much sorrow, she has to be strong  
She needs all her power, for helping the poor  
Showing heaven to you  
There's something to live for, oh what makes you glad  
Oh she can't see it, if people are sad  
A new star in heaven, she helps everyday  
Hope she lives forever and a day  
  
She has a heart, heart of an angel  
She has a heart, heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold  
She has a heart, heart of an angel  
She lives thousand lives in one  
She is the queen of hearts, for her I sing this song  
  
Heart of an angel  
She gives everything, she helps everyone  
Sometimes it's easier, oh said than done  
She wears love like heaven and she knows no fear  
She lives between a laugh and a tear  
  
She has a heart, heart of an angel  
She has a heart, heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold  
She has a heart, heart of an angel  
She lives thousand lives in one  
She is the queen of heart, for her I sing this song (for her I sing this song)  
  
She has a heart, heart of an angel (heart of an angel)  
She has a heart, heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold (oh)  
She has a heart, heart of an angel (heart of an angel)  
She lives thousand lives in one (one)  
She is the queen of heart, for her I sing this song (for her I sing this song)  
  
One heart of gold  
Heart of angel  
Heart of angel
