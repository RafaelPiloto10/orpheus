[Chorus:]  
Rollin' round juugin P's I'm a rollin' pharmacist I'll serve you lean  
I'm rollin' round juugin P's I'm a rollin' pharmacist I'll serve you lean  
  
[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]  
I ain't neva seen a nigga like me where he at where he from I'd like to meet
him  
I'm a rolling stone cookin' with the rolly on 32 shots in my nina  
I'm a rolling stone got my rolly pollie on fuck it not Kafima and Katrina  
Shots of gas bags in the beamer  
Pussy bald head like leukemia  
Watch me set it off like Khadijah  
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel  
Pull up jump off with the Keisha  
See you out dea' I need my money-fa  
Puerto Rican don't need a visa  
Dope white name Mona Lisa  
Frank white head shot Tito  
Longway not Carlito  
Boot up off the molly I don't fuck with the easy hoes  
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo  
Trap house naw bitch I'm trappin' rollin stizzle  
Gas bags I got them bitches going for the lizzo  
Fake shot glass and have them J's at the dizzo  
I'm runnin them I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny  
I'm connected with the pharm-ist got them pints by the hundreds  
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnits  
Still makin drug deals out the trunk of my Honda  
Leanin of a double seal like I'm dumber than dumber  
Rollin off a molly pill tryna fuck on your mama  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]  
I'm servin you Xanax to lean the neighborhood pharm-ist I'll serve you coedine  
My bitch she servin up P's and buy different bags then go by Saline  
She speak different languages but she Portuguese  
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease  
My trap house but her name on the lease  
We might get married like Nas and Kelis  
My bad I'm trippin' I'm back on my G  
Mad black the forgies and srt8 the jeep  
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean  
Thanks to extortion I'm cleaning the streets  
Double are Royces I roll them in fleets  
My trap house stay rollin' I'm never off beat  
I'm baggin up pounds to a new C Note beat  
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer  
(I make the dope dance like I'm mc Hammer [x2])  
Chopin' up pharmists I'm servin you the grammar  
And lean I get it from over the counter  
Chopin' up pharmists with cameras like Tony Montana  
And choppas with clips like bananas  
  
[Chorus x2]
