You know nothin's gettin' done when talk is all you hear  
Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear  
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around  
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground  
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show  
When it gets down to it, everybody knows  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground  
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down  
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night  
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light  
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get  
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm  
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door  
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half  
The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
Ahh yeah  
Gonna getcha  
Getcha good
