[Verse 1]  
We're leaving together  
But still it's farewell  
And maybe we'll come back  
To earth, who can tell?  
I guess there is no one to blame  
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)  
Will things ever be the same again?  
  
[Hook]  
It's the final countdown  
The final countdown  
Ohh!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're heading for Venus (Venus)  
And still we stand tall  
Cause maybe they've seen us  
And welcome us all yeah  
With so many lightyears to go  
And things to be found (to be found)  
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so  
  
[Hook]  
It's the final countdown  
The final countdown  
The final countdown  
(Final countdown). Ohhh oh oh ohhhh  
The final countdown.  
Ohhhhhhhhhh  
It's the final countdown  
The final countdown  
The final countdown  
(Final countdown)
