Flight of dragons soar in the purple light  
In the sky or in my mind  
Flight of dragons sail past reality  
Leave illusion behind  
  
Is it the past I see  
When I look up to the heavens  
Believing in the magic  
That I know could never be  
  
I want to go where they are going  
Into the world they've been  
Can I open up my mind enough to see  
  
Flight of dragons, heavenly argosies  
Catch the wind, rise out of sight  
Flight of dragons, pilots of fantasy  
In the sky or in my mind  
  
Flight of dragons  
Flight of dragons
