You haven't seen the world outside for days  
You sleep, you hope, you wait  
Imagination disappears  
And all the dreams you have you save  
Confrontation like a mirror  
They try to take your mind away  
  
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that you're okay  
  
Are you waiting?  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you [Repeat x2]  
  
Bombarded by the atmosphere  
You breath, you choke, you breath again  
Conversation disappears  
You realize they're not your friends  
The panic of the future rears  
You dig, you jerk  
You find another way  
  
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that you're okay  
  
Are you waiting?  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you  
  
You open up my veins now I don't feel the same  
No no no  
You open up my brain but I won't be replaced  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what I'm always right there behind you
