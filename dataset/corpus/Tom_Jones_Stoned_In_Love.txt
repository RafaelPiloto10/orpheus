If you could see me here this way  
Looking backwards from today  
Would you do it all again  
  
If I could roll it back to you  
Just like lovers always do  
I'm stoned in love but not with you  
  
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love  
It's how I'm feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
We're not feeling stoned in love  
  
If we could wash the past away  
Would we go our separate ways  
I'll do it all again, as if I care  
  
Is this the way it's meant to be  
Stoned in love but not with me  
You're stoned in love in love me  
  
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love  
It's how I'm feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
We're not feeling stoned in love  
  
Stoned in love...  
I'm stoned in love love but not with you  
  
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love  
It's how I'm feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
We're not feeling stoned in love  
  
Stoned in love  
Stoned in love but not with you  
As if I care
