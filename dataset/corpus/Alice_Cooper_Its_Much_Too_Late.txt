I never kicked a dog, a child or my wife  
I never looked at pornography  
I swear it on my holy saint mother's life  
But somehow she's down here with me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
I never stole a thing, a toy or a kiss  
My conscience is a clear as can be  
And when I was a teen, all the sex that I missed  
Was an abstinence blessing to me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much to late
