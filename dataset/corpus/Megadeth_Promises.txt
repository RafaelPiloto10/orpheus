Two hearts that shouldn't  
Talk to each other become close  
In a town much like a prison cell  
  
People speak our names  
On the street in hushed tones  
Oh the stories they'd tell  
If anyone would listen  
  
You come from a town where  
People don't bother saying hello  
Unless somebody's born or dies  
  
And I come from a place where they  
Drag your hopes through the mud  
Because their own dreams are all dying  
  
And when we walk down the street  
The wind sings our name in rebel songs  
The sounds of the night should make us anxious  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you  
Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise  
  
There's so many fighting  
To get past the Pearly Gates  
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved  
  
Their intentions aren't that good  
And I can smell the asphalt  
That's their personal road to hell being paved  
  
And when we walk down the street  
The wind sings our name in rebel songs  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you  
Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you  
Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise
