Such a good feeling  
That's where I want to be (Yeah)  
Locked in your prison  
Of total exstacy (All right, all right)  
You're so strong and you're so together (Baby)  
Next you there is nothing better  
  
[Chorus]  
Always there (To please you)  
Always there (When I need you)  
Always there (To love you)  
Always there (Thinkin' of you)  
  
And if you want to  
If you want to do it too  
  
There's nothing better than being here with you  
Cause your love is a precious treasure (Baby)  
Only you can bring me joy and pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Always there  
Always there (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Always there  
Always there (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
Always there  
Gotta be there baby
