Electric eel  
Swimming through the seas of the unreal  
Trying to land a deal for you to reinvent the wheel  
Electric eel  
  
Electric eye  
Pull the plug, watch him die  
I did not even cry, I guess you know the reasons why  
Electric eye  
  
Was I supposed to go down with the ship?  
I was not the captain, it was not my trip  
Sailing to the moon with Aliice the goon  
Oh yeah!  
  
I'm Popeye the sailor man  
I live in a garbage can!  
Oh maybe you got it, take it away
