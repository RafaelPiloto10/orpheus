Cheated by  
The opposite of love  
Held on high  
From up up up above  
Kept my high  
From the second one  
Kept my eye  
On the first one  
  
Now take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
I'll wear them on  
Another rainy day  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
I'll wear them on  
Another rainy day  
  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
I'll wear them on  
Another rainy day  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
I'll wear them on  
Another rainy day  
  
Well I'm  
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off  
And she's  
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off  
And he's  
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off  
And we're  
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off  
  
Sometimes  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
  
She'll take on high  
She'll take on high-igh  
  
Well sometimes  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound  
Well I think that I'm bigger  
Than the sound
