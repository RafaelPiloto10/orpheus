In a house up the hill  
Lays a boy, he's sleeping still  
And the time's creeping by  
'Til the world prepares to die  
Then again out of dust  
Will arise what ended last  
And the boy will awake  
Give his dream a little brake  
  
And the story now goes on and on and on  
As the old has died the new arises  
And a child will  
  
Light the Universe  
Light the Universe  
We got blind, we can't read the signs  
Light the Universe  
Light the Universe  
We don't find what's hidden in our mind  
  
Under sand in sea  
Covered with eternity  
Beats a heart with no fame  
Quietly whispering my name  
When my time has run out  
I will hear it very loud  
Telling tales I once knew  
But forgot by losing you  
  
And the story now goes on and on and on  
As the old has died the new arises  
And a child will  
  
Light the Universe  
Light the Universe  
We got blind, we can't read the signs  
Light the Universe  
Light the Universe  
We don't find what's hidden in our mind
