[Chorus]  
Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree.  
Gonna have a party. Come on along with me.  
Gonna have a good time, ev'rybody's feelin' right.  
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.  
  
Well, thought I'd call you early,  
I thought you'd like to know there's gonna be a party, and I'd love for you to
go.  
I just want to give you time to get your story right.  
There's gonna be a party, babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're gonna play some music, and we can sing along.  
And I'll bet before the night is through, we'll play your favorite song.  
And when they play the slow dance and I'm holding you so tight, that's when
the party's startin', babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]
