When winter calls and the wind won't wait  
Look through the rain see the leaves start to break  
Once so alone like a prayer on the sea  
Nothing to hide, so much there to see  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
The thoughts you wear like a long lost friend  
Are buried so deep that you can't see them end  
You know spring will come just as quick as you need  
And run straight to you when the dark nights are freed  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid
