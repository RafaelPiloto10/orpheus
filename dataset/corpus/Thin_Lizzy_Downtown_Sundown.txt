If you want your freedom  
There is nothing planned  
If you really need him  
I will understand  
  
[Chorus]  
Please believe in love  
I believe there is a God above  
For love  
And He's coming, yes He's coming  
  
If you want to fly  
Then fly away  
All the cloudy skies  
Belong to yesterday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the shadows the swallow dies  
No one knows the hobo hides  
There is no need to apologize  
  
This is the story of a downtown sundown  
If you climb the mountain  
You will see  
There is no great distance  
Between the Lord and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the shadows a swallow dies  
No one knows the hobo hides  
There is no need to apologize  
This is the story of a downtown sundown
