Let me see your hands in the air  
  
I remember dreaming bout  
The things I do right now  
Late I find on to a cloud  
Scared to look back down  
I remember when  
I was all alone  
Nobody round  
To hold me down  
But now you're here with me tonight  
Look at what you found  
I was lonely for some time  
Now it's only you and I  
I won't leave without your love tonight, tonight  
  
I'm dancing  
To the sound  
My world's in the clouds  
Too high to come down  
So let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air  
  
It's go hard or go home and it ain't no lookin' back  
My toughest enemy's is in the mirror, would you look at that?  
I'm top five, dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme  
And if I ever take a seat I stood the test of times  
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on  
Better know that I abused it  
If I die before my time I'll still be living through my music  
I cracked the industry open but still got this shit on lock  
Even on the highway up to heaven Luda still would be on top  
  
I'm dancing  
To the sound  
My world's in the clouds  
Too high to come down  
So let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Ooh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Ooh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Ooh  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Ooh  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Ooh  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Ooh  
  
I'm dancing  
To the sound  
My world's in the clouds  
Too high to come down  
So let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air
