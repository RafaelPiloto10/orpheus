I'm gonna marry the night  
I won't give up on my life  
I'm a warrior queen  
Live passionately tonight  
  
I'm gonna marry the dark  
Gonna make love to the stark  
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness  
I am a winner  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm not gonna cry anymore  
I'm gonna marry the night  
Leave nothing on these streets to explore  
M-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
  
I'm gonna lace up my boots  
Throw on some leather and cruise  
Down the street that I love  
In my fishnet gloves  
I'm a sinner  
  
Then I'll go down to the bar  
But I won't cry anymore  
I hold my whiskey up high  
Kiss the bartender twice  
I'm a loser  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing's too cool  
To take me from you  
New York is not just a tan  
That you'll never loose  
  
Love is the new  
Denim or black  
Skeleton guns  
Or wedding bells in the attic  
  
Get Ginger ready  
Climb the El Camino front  
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels  
'Cause that's where we make love  
  
Come on and run  
Turn the car on and run  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road  
I'm gonna marry the night  
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode  
M-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
I'm gonna marry, marry  
I'm gonna marry, marry  
Come on, come on  
  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night
