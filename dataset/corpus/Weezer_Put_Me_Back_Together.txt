One, two, three, four  
  
When I walk  
Down the street  
I been trippin' on my feet  
  
And my clothes  
They don't match  
And my blue jeans need a patch  
  
It's cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
It's cold outside  
Won't you let me come inside and make it right  
  
Here it's clear, that I'm not getting better  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
  
What I do, isn't cool  
And my lips are lined with drool  
I'm a mess, since you left  
You can use this fool, I'm gonna use this too  
  
It's cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
It's cold outside  
Would you let me come inside, and make it right  
  
Here, it's clear, that I'm not getting better  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
I'm alone, in my room, I don't know what to do  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
(You put me back together)  
  
And when I day dream  
When eating ice cream  
It's such a nice scene  
  
But then I wake up crying  
I know I just been lying  
  
Here, it's clear, that I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)  
When I fall down, you put me back together (put me back together)  
Right, it's clear, that I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
  
I'm alone, in my room, I don't know what to do  
When I fall down you put me back together
