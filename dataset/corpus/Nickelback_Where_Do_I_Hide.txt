Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines  
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine  
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due  
Walking down the aisle, still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming where do I hide?  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
  
He said, she said, no she don't  
Be back before morning, you know she won't  
I remember that summer, like yesterday  
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away  
  
I still hear him screaming  
Where do I hide?  
All he asks, I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
  
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines  
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine  
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due  
Walking down the aisle, still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming  
Where do I hide?  
All he asks, I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
Where do I hide?
