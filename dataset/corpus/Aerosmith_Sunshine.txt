I sold my soul for a one night stand  
I followed Alice into Wonderland  
I ate the mushroom and I danced with the queen  
Yeah we danced in between all the lines  
I followed daylight right into the dark  
Took to the Hatter like a walk in the park  
But then I met her yeah she felt so right  
No child of the night yeah was she  
They called her sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah  
Sunshine...yeah  
Her kind of love's what I adore  
What kind of trouble am I in for  
My kinda heaven lies at hell's back door  
And I got more than I need  
'Cuz I need sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
My sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah  
Sunshine...yeah  
Fffff...I got the karma but it don't come free  
I'll chase that rabbit up her booty tree  
The caterpillar's tryin' to cop a plea  
But the smoke ain't got nothin' on me  
Ya gotta have my sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
The sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
My sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose... yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
Sunshine...yeah
