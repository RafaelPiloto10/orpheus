Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing infront of me  
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby  
Want to go?"  
  
I should've said no  
Someone's waiting for me  
But I got my coat, called and said  
  
Listen baby, I'm sorry  
Just want to tell you don't worry  
I will be late  
Don't stay up and wait for me  
I said again, your dropping out  
My battery is low  
Just so you know  
We're going to a place nearby  
Gotta go  
  
Now two is done, nothing's been won  
I can't take it back, what's done is done  
But what if my friends found out  
That she wasn't my only one  
And it eats me from inside  
That she's not by my side  
Just because I made that call, yeah  
  
Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing in front of me  
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby"  
Gotta go
