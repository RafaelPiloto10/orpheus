I am numb but I can still feel you  
Sometimes I'm blind but I see you  
You are here but so far away  
  
The times when you wanna, I'm missing you  
Makes me feel like I'm spinning  
Sometimes you get what you gain  
  
I'm on a coaster-collision  
Am not about to give in  
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in.  
  
Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings  
No intermission, so let  
Let the party begin.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
  
Can you hear me? can you hear me? can you hear me? can you hear me?  
  
Don't you mean that you're my vision  
I gotta make a decision  
Do I go, do I stay? (stay)  
  
You've gotten into my system  
You are in control of my mental  
I'm in a euphoric state  
  
I'm on a coaster-collision  
Am not about to give in  
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in.  
  
Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings  
No intermission, so let  
Let the party begin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you hear me? [Repeats]  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Enrique, yea I can  
This is Mr Morales
