At words poetic, I'm so pathetic  
That I always found it best  
Instead of getting 'em off my chest  
To let 'em rest unexpressed  
  
I hate parading, serenading  
As I'll probably miss the bar  
But if this ditty is not so pretty  
At least it'll tell you how great you are  
  
You're the tops  
You're the Colosseum  
You're the top  
You're the Louvre Museum  
  
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss  
You're a Bendel bonnet  
A Shakespeare's sonnet  
You're Mickey Mouse  
  
You're the Nile  
You're the Tower of Pisa  
Mama, you're the smile  
On the Mona Lisa  
  
I'm a worthless check  
A total wreck, a flop  
But if, baby, I'm the bottom  
You're the top  
  
You're the top  
You're Mahatma Gandhi  
You're the top  
You're Napoleon Brandy  
  
You're the purple light  
Of a summer night in Spain  
You're the National Gallery  
You're Crosby's salary  
You're cellophane  
  
Mama you're sublime  
You're a turkey dinner  
Oh, you're the time of a Derby winner  
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop  
  
But if, baby, I'm the bottom  
You're the top
