Where I've been, you don't know.  
And what I've got, baby, it don't show.  
Now, I won't try to teach you how, don't talk now.  
Don't talk roads, don't talk sand.  
Don't talk dust, don't talk no man.  
Don't talk rules, don't talk vows, don't talk now.  
  
I don't want to hear the same old song,  
And too many rights still make her wrong, baby.  
I know she can't hurt me less by talking more,  
She can't make good what was bad before.  
  
No, It's too late now for me to lie  
And I can't make a second try.  
I just came on back, baby  
Got to say good bye, good bye.  
Don't talk now, don't talk now.  
Don't talk now, don't talk now.
