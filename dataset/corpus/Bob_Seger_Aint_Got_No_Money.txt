Well I'm looking for a woman  
About five foot six  
Who ain't into glamour  
She's just into kicks  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby  
Don't run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love  
Well I'm walking down the street  
And my heart's feeling heavy  
Swaying with the beat  
'Cause I'm more than just ready  
She's looking at me  
I can feel it in my bones  
Step right on up  
And I'll be taking you home  
Don't turn away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lot of love  
A whole lot of love  
Well I'm looking for a woman  
Who's looking for a man  
Who's looking for a time  
Like she ain't ever had  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby don't run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love
