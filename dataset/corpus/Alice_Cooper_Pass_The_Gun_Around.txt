Sonny wakes up in the morning feeling kinda sick  
Needs a little Stoli Vodka, needs it really quick  
Sees a little blood run from his eyes  
Feels a little hotel paralyzed  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
And throw me in the local river, let me float away  
  
I wake up watching cartoons...the television's on  
There's a couple of party balloons and all my money's gone  
She was just a reason to unwind  
And actually the last thing I could find  
  
Why don't you, pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you better  
Pass the gun around  
And dump me in the local river, let me float away  
float away, ah float away  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, why don't you  
Pass the gun around  
Throw me in the local river, let me float away  
  
Sonny wakes up in the morning, there's a stranger in his bed  
Someone's pounding on the hotel door, he wishes he was dead  
I've had so many blackout nights before  
I don't think I can take this anymore  
  
Why don't you, pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, why don't you  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, we're gonna  
Pass the gun around  
  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, we're gonna  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
  
Da Da
