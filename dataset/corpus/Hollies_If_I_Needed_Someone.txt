If I needed someone to love  
You're the one that I'd be thinking of  
If I needed someone  
If I had some more time to spend  
  
Then I'd guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
Had you come some other day then  
It might not have been like this  
  
Can't you see how I'm too much in love  
Carve your number on my wall  
And maybe you will get a call from me
