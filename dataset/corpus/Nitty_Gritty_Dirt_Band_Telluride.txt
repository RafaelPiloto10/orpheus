Now the girls in telluride do it like this  
Cross their fingers when they kiss you  
Don't say nothing behind your back  
And they don't take nothin' that they don't give back  
Take the gold into telluride  
Work all winter in the tomboy mine  
Dreamin' of what we'll do  
When the snow finally ends  
And the spring breaks through  
We'll load up the wagon and set the little one by our side  
Take the gold into telluride  
I'd like to lay you down on a cannonball bed  
Put a soft feather pillow down by your head  
Intertwine flowers into a maiden's veil  
Wake you in the morning  
Now she's wailing take the gold into telluride  
Ain't nothing'll stop an avalanche when it's sliding  
Once the wagon starts to roll, you can't turn the mule and the brakes don't
hold  
You end up in the valley with the little one by your side  
Take the gold into telluride  
Lace curtains for the windows  
Dreams torn from a catalog page  
We may wander where the wind blows  
You change your views but our love won't change  
She gonna climb you high on top of a hill  
Fall asleep laughing with the whipporwill  
Intertwined flowers in the matrons ring  
Wake you in the morning  
Now she's singing take the gold into telluride  
I loved my winter with a teenage bride  
Dreamin of what we'll do  
When the snow finally ends  
And the spring breaks through  
We'll load up the wagon, set the little one by our side  
Take the gold into telluride  
Take the gold into telluride
