I used to want to dream  
I used to want to scream at the top of my lungs  
Like a diamond in a ring  
Or the song you love to sing  
The shine is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Walking in circles, circles  
Walking in circles  
Walking in  
Walking in  
  
I used to want to run  
I used to want to climb up to the sun  
Ambition is killing me  
And the new trends and the money  
Oh, I feel so cheap  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a feeling that you know  
A feeling that explodes  
A feeling you want more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
  
Circles  
See them?  
  
It's a feeling that you know  
A feeling that explodes  
A feeling you want more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
  
A feeling that you know  
A feeling that explodes  
A feeling you want more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more (more, more, more)  
And more (more, more, more)  
And more (more, more, more)  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more  
And more (and more)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a feeling that you know (know)  
A feeling that explodes (explodes)  
A feeling you want more (you want more)  
And more  
And more  
And more  
  
It's a feeling that you know (know)  
A feeling that explodes (explodes)  
A feeling you want more (you want more)  
And more  
And more  
And more
