Here under heaven's eyes,  
down under paradise,  
sometimes it seems like we're so small.  
Here on the shores that reach  
into infinity,  
how could we matter much at all?  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love?  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.  
We live to learn to love.  
Oh, mercy from above.  
Amazing grace, like rain comes falling down.  
We sing our hearts to you,  
our song of gratitude.  
The voice of ev'ry soul,  
how sweet the sound.  
We can only trust  
all our prayers will all add up.  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love?  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.
