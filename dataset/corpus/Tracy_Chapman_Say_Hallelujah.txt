Say Hallelujah  
Throw up your hands  
The bucket is kicked  
The body is gone  
  
Close your eyes  
And bow your head  
To rest your soul  
And to praise the dead  
  
Say Hallelujah  
Throw up your hands  
The bucket is kicked  
The body is gone  
  
Dry your eyes  
And stand upright  
Put a smile on your face  
He wouldn't want us to cry  
  
The sun will rise  
The stars will shine  
Turning day to dusk  
And night to dawn  
We'll pass on  
But until that time  
  
Say Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Say Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
Say Hallelujah  
Throw up your hands  
The bucket is kicked  
The body is gone  
  
Have mercy  
It's a wonderful life  
Eternal rest for the weary  
Mourners party tonight  
  
Say Hallelujah  
Throw up your hands  
The bucket is kicked  
The body is gone  
  
Wave your hands  
But don't say goodbye  
We're all gonna meet you  
On the other side
