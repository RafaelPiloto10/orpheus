They tell me  
Somewhere this life isn't crazy  
But I've traveled the world far and wide  
And I say they're wrong  
  
Don't sell me  
Stories that music's a lady  
It's not when the singer's alone  
At the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]  
At the end of a song  
There's no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And there's nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
It's lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But we've come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]
