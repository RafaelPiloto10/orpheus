Truth covered in security  
I can't let you smother me  
I'd like to but it couldn't work  
Trading off and taking turns  
I don't regret a thing  
  
I've got this friend, you see  
Who makes me feel  
And I wanted more  
Than I could steal  
I'll arrest myself  
And wear a shield  
I'll go out of my way  
To prove I still  
Smell her on you  
  
Don't, tell me what I wanna hear  
Afraid of never knowning fear  
Experience anything you need  
I'll keep fighting jealousy  
Until it's fucking gone  
  
I've got this friend, you see  
Who makes me feel  
And I wanted more  
Than I could steal  
I'll arrest myself  
And wear a shield  
I'll go out of my way  
To prove I still  
Smell her on you

I'll go out of my way  
To make you a deal  
We've make a pact  
To learn from who  
Ever we want  
Without new rules  
We'll share what's lost and what we grew  
They'll go out of their way  
To prove they still  
Smell her on you  
They still, smell her on you  
Smell her on you
