Ok, talk to you,  
South America, Australia  
France, Germany  
U.K., Africa  
  
Calling out around the world  
Are you ready for a brand new beat  
Summer's here and the time is right  
For dancing in the streets  
They're dancing in Chicago  
Down in New Orleans, in New York city  
  
All we need is music, sweet music  
There'll be music everywhere  
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing  
And dancing in the street, oh  
  
It doesn't matter what you wear  
Just as long as you are there  
So come on, every guy grab a girl,  
Everywhere, around the world  
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street  
  
It's an invitation across the nation  
A chance for folks to meet  
They'll be laughing and singing, and music swinging  
And dancing in the street  
  
Philadelphia, P.A., Baltimore in D.C. now  
Don't forget the Motor City  
On the streets of Brazil  
Back in the U.S.S.R., don't matter where you are  
  
All we need is music, sweet music  
There'll be music everywhere  
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing  
And dancing in the street, oh  
  
It doesn't matter what you wear  
Just as long as you are there  
So come on every guy, grab a girl  
Everywhere, around the world  
They'll be dancing, dancing in the streets  
  
Way down in L. A. Everyday  
Dancing in the streets  
Cross in China too, me and you  
Dancing in the street  
  
Don't you know  
They'll be dancing  
Dancing in the street  
  
Don't you know  
They'll be da, da, da, da  
Dancing, dancing in the street
