Take cover, young lovers,  
Fall apart at the seams  
It's stainless steel, that's how I feel,  
You're the girl of my dreams  
  
Well I tried to call you on the phone,  
Your dad said that you weren't at home  
  
But we are, picking up the pieces of our lovin'  
Over and over again  
Picking up the pieces let's do it again  
We're picking up the pieces,  
Picking up the pieces of our love  
  
Well, I need your lovin'  
To show me what I am  
And I want your body  
To make me feel like a man  
  
You know that I'm down on my knees,  
You know it's you that I want to please, please  
  
Picking up the pieces of our lovin'  
Over and over again  
Picking up the pieces let's do it again  
We're picking up the pieces,  
Picking up the pieces of our love
