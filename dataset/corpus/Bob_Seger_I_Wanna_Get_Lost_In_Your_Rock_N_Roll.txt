Day after day I'm more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
Oh I'm feeling strange, ain't it a shame  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
I'm getting the feelin that I'm wasting my time  
You don't understand the things I do  
The World outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you, to carry me through  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
And when my mind is free  
No melody can move me  
When I'm feelin blue  
I guess I'm coming through and soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to klnow I believe in your soul  
Let me rhyme in harmony  
You helped me along, you're makin me strong  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away
