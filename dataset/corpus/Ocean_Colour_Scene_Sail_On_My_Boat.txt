I'm gonna sail on my boat and keep it afloat forever  
Nobody's gonna tell me how it won't stay together  
I got a waiting ticket won't you sail it  
Nobody's who's staying asleep knows what I'm saying  
  
I'm gonna throw out a rope and keep it afloat it's granted  
Independence  
I'm gonna wake and take us all to where oh  
Nobody's gonna talk me down by stormy weather  
  
Got to sail my boat  
Got to keep afloat  
I get the need to keep on when I'm sailing  
  
I'll sail across don't make it a choice I'll plan it  
Nobody ever thought you wouldn't take you for granted  
I'll tie the ropes that keep me afloat and sailing  
Nobody ever taught me teach what I'm playing  
  
Gonna lift up my voice and sing you a song romantic  
Independence  
  
Repeat [chorus]  
Hold on in love take it to where you never  
Nobody's gonna tell me how it won't stay together  
I've got a freedom ticket lets go sailing  
Nobody's who's staying asleep knows what I'm saying  
  
Repeat [chorus twice]
