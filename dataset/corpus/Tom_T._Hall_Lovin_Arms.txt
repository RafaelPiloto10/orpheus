If you could see me now the one who said that he'd rather roam  
The one who said he'd rather be alone if you could only see me now  
If I could hold you now just for a moment if I could really make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time if I could only hold you now  
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain taking any comforts that I
can  
Looking back and longin' for the freedom of my chains  
Lying in your lovin' arms again  
[ ac.guitar ]  
If you could hear me now singing somewhere in the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight if you could only see me now  
I've been too long in the wind...  
If you could see me now
