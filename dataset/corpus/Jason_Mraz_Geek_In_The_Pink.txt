Well let the geek in the pink take a stab at it  
If you like the way I'm thinkin' baby wink at it  
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat full 'a rhymes  
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it a  
Isn't it delicious crazy way that I'm kissin'  
Cause baby listen to this don't want to miss it while it's hittin'  
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in  
But don't ever quit so soon I'm gonna let you win but see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You can vibe without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby I could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be a let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge me by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I'm the geek in the pink pink pink  
I'm the geek in the pink yeah  
  
Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody  
But cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her  
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter  
At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and a  
She was staring through the doorframe  
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend  
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then  
Cause I ain't comin' home, I don't need that attention, see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it shouldn't be the let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
You could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I am more than you're thinking  
Hey look at me go  
From hero to zero  
Oh take it from a geek like me  
I can save you from unoriginal dumb-dums  
Who wouldn't care if you com...plete him or not  
  
So what I've got a short attention span  
A coke in my hand  
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand  
Mm hip hop and flip flops it don't stop with the light rock  
A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot  
The hype is nothing more than hoo-hah so I'm  
Developing a language and I'm calling it my own  
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean  
That on the other side the grass is greener  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I'm the geek in the pink pink pink  
I'm the geek in the pink yeah  
I'm the geek in the pink  
All y'all it's the new color for fall
