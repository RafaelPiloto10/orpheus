Children carry through the streets  
A brightly painted star.  
Angels gather round the hearth,  
Strumming on guitars.  
Men of great renown and faith  
Say prayers on boulevards.  
It's the night before christmas.  
  
But you don't have to be an angel  
To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)  
And you don't have to be a wise man  
On bended knee.  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night before christmas.)  
  
If your heart's been longing,  
You've been afraid to try,  
Sorrow's kept you company,  
And the dance has passed by,  
I'll lift you up and blaze with you  
Across the moonlit sky  
On the night before christmas.  
  
'cause you don't have to be an angel  
To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)  
And you don't have to be a wise man  
On bended knee.  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) la, la, la, la
