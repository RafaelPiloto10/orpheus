Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear  
  
I should run for my life,  
But i stay still  
I should scream till i'm sore,  
But i don't  
I should lay down my life,  
And i will  
But for this,  
For this i won't.  
  
I feel sorry for those who've lost their compassion  
I feel sorry for those who still can, but don't  
I would lay down my life for my child  
But for them,  
For them i won't.  
  
Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear  
  
Motema eleli pinzoli ya maura  
Bokabuani ya molino ekobebisa mokili  
Soki po na koboma bato naboyi  
Ngai na kokoka te, oh....  
  
(translation:  
My heart is crying, tears of sorrow  
When the soul is divided, all our worlds are broken  
But if it comes to taking human life, i refuse..  
Not me....not ever...)  
  
Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear
