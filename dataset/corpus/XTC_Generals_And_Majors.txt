Generals and Majors ah ah  
They're never too far  
From battlefields so glorious  
Out in a world of their own  
They'll never come down  
Till once again victorious  
  
Generals and Majors always  
Seem so unhappy 'less they got a war  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
Like never before are tired of being actionless.  
  
Calling Generals and Majors  
Generals and Majors everywhere  
Calling Generals and Majors  
Your World War III is drawing near  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
They're never too far  
Away from men who made the grade  
Out in a world of their own  
They'll never come down  
Until the battle's lost or made  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
Like never before, are tired of being in the shade
