Debra waiting on the corner  
Flaring smile and daring style  
Big G cruising, neon flashing  
Lost and found tinsel town  
Daytime orphans join the circus  
Climb the rope and walk the wire  
To feel the night and music playing  
Feed the fire to feed the fire  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Couples coasting, singles searching  
Loners lost among the crowd  
Action turning on reaction  
Loosen up, fool around  
Pretzel vendor, first class spender  
Limousine and ketchup dream  
Pinball hall and Roulette roller  
Every scene for everything  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife  
Nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
It's the only another nightlife  
[Incomprehensible]  
Nightlife
