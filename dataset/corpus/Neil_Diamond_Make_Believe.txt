Make believe we're in love  
Let's pretend that we share eternity  
Make believe, come with me far away  
Let's just you and I  
Bid this world goodbye  
  
Make believe  
Make my life worth living  
Stand by me to the end  
Happiness comes in giving  
Is it so hard to pretend?  
  
Close your eyes, take my hand  
I may be a fool  
Still I pray that you'll  
Make believe  
  
Make believe we're in love  
Why can't you pretend  
That we're more than friends  
Make believe, come with me far away  
Fill each lonely night  
With a love that's right  
  
Make believe  
Make my live worth living  
Stand by me to the end  
Happiness comes in giving  
Is it so hard to pretend?  
  
Close your eyes, dream with me  
I may be a fool  
Still I pray that you'll  
Make believe
