Baby, don't you she'd a tear for me  
I wouldn't want to waste your time  
You talked a lot of trash and ya lied to me  
But babe, you never even tried  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
You can hold my heart for ransom  
But you'll never own my soul  
  
CHORUS  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I'll never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you  
Baby, I'm burning our bed  
  
There used to be a time when you were everything  
My flame through the night  
You got me hot  
Then you blew me out  
Like this match I'm about to light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
You can tear my heart to pieces  
Left me standing in the cold  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
One thing I gotta do  
Is torch those sheets and pillows too  
Baby, I'm burning out bed  
  
Well, I used to think your were so kind  
How could I be so blind  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm free  
But I'm alone  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I swear to you  
Is you're gonna feel the heat before the night is through  
  
Baby you're burning me,  
Sometimes a man can bleed  
Baby, I'm burning our bed  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I'll never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you  
Baby, I'm burning our bed
