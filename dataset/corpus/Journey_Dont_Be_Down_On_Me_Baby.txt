I don't know why, there's an open flame  
Burnin' in the game, it's me you blame  
I can't deny, it was a crime  
If you would let me try, maybe you'd change your mind  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Those little things, you say I do  
Well they might be true  
Tell me what good does it do  
When things go wrong, I'm the first you blame  
I try another way, still someone's gotta pay  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
'Cause I love you  
'Cause I need you
