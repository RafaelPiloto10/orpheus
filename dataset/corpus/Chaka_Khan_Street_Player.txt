I'd never forget those nameless years  
Street sounds whirling through my mind  
Trouble was often in the air  
So we thought to forget our despair  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I play you a song (Play me a song, play me a song)  
Cause my heart and soul  
Will carry, carry on  
  
City life's the only way  
Street corners and billiard halls  
Was my home away  
Lesson's learned that still help me today  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I've seen it all (play me a song, play me a song)  
Hit men and thieves and many a brawl  
But as you will see I still stand tall  
  
It was such a small space and time  
I would never knew that I would find  
A musical past for all to see exciety to ecstasy  
  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I've seen it all (play me a song, play me a song)

The people love your soul  
Don't let them down  
Play your guitar  
Play that funky music, child
