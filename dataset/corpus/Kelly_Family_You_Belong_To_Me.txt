  
  
If you please  
If you want  
Won't you take me in your arms  
If you care, you really care for me  
Why haven't you taken me in your arms  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know, how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you now oh babe  
  
Are you saying that I made it all up  
I'm loosing my self-esteem  
Am I ever going to see you again  
I'm loosing my confidence  
  
You're passing by (passing by)  
You're leaving me behind (leaving me behind)  
All my dreams now up the sky  
Why not me (why not me)  
Is it her 'cause (is it her 'cause)  
Should have told me long ago  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you know what it is  
  
Don't you know that you're tearing my soul  
How far do you want to go  
But I'll get up and walk on and on  
I'm a different woman now  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know, how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you now oh babe  
  
Am I ever going find you out there  
I'm loosing my confidence
