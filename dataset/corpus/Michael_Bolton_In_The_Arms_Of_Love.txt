I see your face and feel your heartache  
I see the trace of the tears you have cried  
The silent sound of the heart left unspoken  
You were strong enough to hide  
All your life, no one's ever shown you  
What it's really like to have someone to hold you  
  
[Chorus]  
In the arms of love, heaven's just a heartbeat away  
I'll be your light in the dark, your shield from the storm  
Your shelter from the rain  
And in the arms of love I'll lift you above all the madness  
All of the pain  
And you'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love  
  
We search this world for a little compassion  
For just one look through the eyes of a child  
For one more chance to be a believer  
While there's still a chance in time  
All your life no one there beside you  
Close your eyes and let this moment find you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
High above the world where dreams are sailing  
Far beyond the brightest shinin' star  
Where everything you've waited for is waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll keep you far from harm here in the arms of love
