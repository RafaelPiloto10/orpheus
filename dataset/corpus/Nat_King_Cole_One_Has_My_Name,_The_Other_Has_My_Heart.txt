One has my name, the other has my heart  
With one, I'll remain, that's how my heartaches start  
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue  
To one, I am tied, to the other, I am true  
  
One has my love, the other, only me  
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free?  
So I'll go on livin' my life, just the same  
While one has my heart, the other has my name  
  
One has my love, the other, only me  
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free?  
If I could live over, my life, I would change  
The one who has my heart would also have my name
