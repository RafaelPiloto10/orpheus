I been crying like a woman  
Because I'm mad, mad, mad like a man  
If you'd been in the S.S. in '43  
You'd have been kicked out for cruelty  
  
I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
  
I been wondering about your dependency  
Your idea of defiance is a modern day mystery  
Arms and chest are cold  
When your back is on fire  
And the only time you come clean  
Is when you're talking to your buyer  
  
I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
  
Forget our philosophies  
That we admired when we were young  
And our popular points of view  
They can't mean much or nothing  
Or something or anything  
'Cause we can't say "I love you"  
  
I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me  
  
Happy birthday, darling and thank you for the schooling  
Your correction mistress warned me and she wasn't fooling  
Never trust a user with your television overnight  
When the show he wants to video is "Dallas" on a Tuesday night  
Don't try to paint your masterpiece under artificial light
