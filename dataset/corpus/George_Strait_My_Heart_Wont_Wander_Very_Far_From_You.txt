Well honey don't you worry I don't need no bar room queens  
Though I'll admit she sure knows how to fill a pair of jeans  
And I'll admit now darlin' she's sure showing me her stuff  
But honey it ain't nearly enough  
  
'Cause I ain't never seen her  
Patch a pair of raged britches  
Stretch a paycheck 'till it reaches  
Scratch my back right where it itches  
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
Now honey you know I honor all the hard times with been through  
I never could have made it with anyone but you  
And I think I know when a lady's really really tough  
And she don't show me nearly enough  
  
'Cause I ain't never seen her  
Stay up all night with a baby  
Calm me down when I get crazy  
Fix me grits and red-eye gravy  
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
No I ain't never seen her  
Make a six room house a castle  
Teach young'uns how to wrestle  
Straighten out my fishin' tackle  
I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
No I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you
