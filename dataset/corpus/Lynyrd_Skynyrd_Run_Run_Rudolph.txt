Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind  
Run, run Rudolph, Randolph's not too far behind  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
Randolph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down.  
  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?  
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a shooting star  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
  
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a girl child what would you like most to get?  
I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a saber jet  
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a-running like a son-of-a-gun
