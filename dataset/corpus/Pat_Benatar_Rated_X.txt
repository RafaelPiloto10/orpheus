She's a personality, enjoying popularity  
For making movies Rated X  
Posing for a magazine, picture in a limousine  
Someone simulating sex  
Never thought that she could be  
Lonely with her vanity  
Wasted days and lonely nights  
Working for the sugar man  
Make each other happy man  
Cause satisfaction's guaranteed all night  
  
Drinking champagne is a past time  
Making hot love is a main line  
Money buys love and a wild time  
Making hot love is a main line  
Hot Love!  
  
She wakes up, and breaks up  
And wonders why love is unkind  
She waits up, and makes up  
And looks in the mirror to find  
  
Pink champagne and diamond rings  
Fascinating bright young things  
Dancing at the discotechs  
Starring from the silver screen  
See you in a midnight dream - Rated X  
  
Drinking champagne is a past time  
Making hot love is a main line  
Money buys love and a wild time  
Making hot love is a main line  
  
Drinking champagne is a past time  
Making hot love is a main line  
Money buys love and a wild time  
Making hot love is a main line  
Hot Love!  
  
Come on, gimme' hot love  
Satisfaction guaranteed
