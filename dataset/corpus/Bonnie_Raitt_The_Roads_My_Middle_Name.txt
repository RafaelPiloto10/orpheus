I told you once the day we met  
I wouldn't be your queen  
Your little darlin', sweet coquette  
Just what my routine  
You've been around enough to know  
There's really no one else  
When I hear that siren call, baby  
I just can't help myself  
I gotta go  
I hope you'll understand  
I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go, baby  
Because the road's my middle name  
Well, it's hard enough to love someone  
When they're right close to home  
Don't you think I know it's hard, honey  
To squeeze the sugar from the phone  
Guess the road is in my blood  
'Cause I'm my daddy's kid  
Just have to learn how to let me go  
Just like my momma did  
I gotta go  
I hope you'll understand  
Yeah, I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call, baby  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
Because the road's my middle name  
Hear it call  
And it sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
'Cause the road is my middle name  
I gotta go  
'Cause the road my middle name  
Ooh, I gotta go, darlin'  
Because the road is my middle name
