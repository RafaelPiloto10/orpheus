Since my baby left me, i found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street at heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
  
Though the place is crowded, you still can find some room  
Where those broken hearted lovers cry away their blues  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely
