Hey little baby, I don't want to talk  
I really like the way how you walk  
I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth  
That I'm hooked on you baby  
Oh let me know, where we going girl  
More and more you're in my world  
I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth  
That I'm hooked on you, my baby  
Oh I feel your heartbeat is true  
And I'm so In love with you  
Can't you feel the rhythm of love  
Baby can't you see, just for me, heaven above  
  
I'm not guilty, baby I'm not guilty  
for the moonlight  
Tell me, tell me, baby that it's your night  
Baby show me heaven again, again  
I'm not guilty, baby I'm not guilty  
for the moonlight  
Do you, do you, do you feel it tonight  
Oh I want to making good love, to you  
  
Hey little baby, are you alone  
It's not far, far from my home  
I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth  
That I'm hooked on you, my baby  
Are you ready to play this game  
I show your love, it's not the same  
I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth  
That I'm hooked on you my baby  
Oh I feel your heartbeat is true  
And I'm so in love with you  
Can't you feel the rhythm of love  
Baby can't you see, just for me, heaven above
