In the name of it's for you I  
Bought it all and it's all untrue I  
Know, I'm a little slow  
Desparate and it shows  
  
In the name of spending street(?)  
Burning bush and a busted knee you  
Stole, all the rain and snow  
  
Who will be my Eskimo  
It's what I wanna know  
It's time to under go  
Somewhere in Mexico  
I'm making room for you  
A Simple Point of view  
Someone too deeper to  
  
Aw  
Searching for an eskimo  
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you  
What did they say  
Desperate and I gotta go  
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you  
  
In the name of Jesus Christ I  
Sold my son and I named my price I  
Sold, just a little low  
  
Who will be my eskimo  
That's what I wanna know  
Before I under go  
Somewhere in Mexico  
I'm making room for you  
A Simple point of view  
Someone too deeper to  
  
Ooooooh aw  
Searching for an eskimo  
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you  
Hey hey hey  
Desperate and I gotta go  
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you  
  
In the name of Oscar Wilde I  
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I  
Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find and eskimo
