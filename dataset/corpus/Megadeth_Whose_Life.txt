Uuu you're just in time  
Come get inside my head  
Uuu the war of words  
You're underneath my skin  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know what's best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than a price  
When are you gonna pay?  
  
You only point out fault  
An anxiety attack  
You're a nay you mouth  
You stab me in my back  
  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know what's best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than the price  
When are you gonna pay?  
  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than the price  
When you gonna pay?  
  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway? x3
