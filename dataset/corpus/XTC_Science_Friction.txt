I look out of my window at night  
I see the stars and I'm filled with fright  
I got a feeling someone's looking  
It ain't the aliens at the foot of my bed  
It's more the ale inside my head  
I got a feeling something's cooking  
Science friction burns my fingers  
Electricity still lingers  
Hey put away that ray, how do you martians say  
I love you  
I read my comics from front to back  
I'll be ready for any attack  
I got a feeling someone's looking
