Sun comes up on this new morning  
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings  
And if these words could have kept you happy  
  
I'd do anything  
  
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder  
With a tender touch, you know so well  
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters  
Baby, who can really tell,  
When two hearts belong so well  
  
Maybe the walls will tumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I love you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
(I don't know)  
That's for all time  
Baby you gotta know  
(I don't know)  
That's for all time  
  
Moon shines down on this good evening  
One warm kiss in this cold night air  
For this good love I'm receiving  
I'll go anywhere  
Just as long as you are there  
  
And maybe the walls will tumble  
Sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I love you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
That's for all time  
(I don't know)  
Baby you gotta know  
(I don't know)  
That's for all time  
  
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...  
The sun in me  
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...  
All these words that young lovers say...  
  
And maybe the walls will crumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I need you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
That's for all time  
(I don't know)  
Baby you gotta know  
(I don't know)  
That's for all time  
  
Baby, you can never go  
Baby, you gotta know  
See that you never go  
That's for all time  
Baby, you never know  
(I don't know)  
That's for all time...
