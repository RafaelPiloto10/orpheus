Down on the street where the faces shine  
Floatin' around I'm a real low mind  
See a pretty thing in a wall  
See a pretty thing in a wall  
  
In a wall  
In a wall  
In a wall  
  
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love  
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love  
A thousand eyes they look at you  
A thousand eyes they, they look at you  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Oh come on!  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh come on! [Repeat x3]  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Where faces shine  
A real low mind  
Faces shine  
A real low  
  
Oh come on! [Repeat x3]  
Yeah yeah yeah
