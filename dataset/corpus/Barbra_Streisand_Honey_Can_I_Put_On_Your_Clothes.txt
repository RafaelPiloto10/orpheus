Honey, honey, can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
Oh, won't you please let me?  
Because they get to me,  
They touch me and then move me.  
  
I get to thinking I won't be needin'  
Anything more to keep me warm.  
I feel the feeling of you  
Al1 the way through.  
No other feeling will ever do.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
  
They're just like old friends  
When we're together.  
They comfort me and soothe me.  
They're not brand new.  
  
They're a little worn through,  
But they're comfy and roomy.  
They do something to me,  
And when I stay at home,  
And you're far away,  
I won' t be lonely all through the day.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
  
I feel the feeling of you  
All the day through.  
No other feeling will ever do.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you,  
Honey, honey, honey, hum
