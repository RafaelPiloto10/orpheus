And here's one of the nation's top tunes  
As a matter of fact, it's number one in your hit parade  
The nation's big hit coming in on 'a Wing And A Prayer'  
  
Coming in on a wing and a prayer  
(Coming in on a wing and a prayer)  
Coming in on a wing and a prayer  
(Coming in a plane)  
  
Though there's one who is gone, we still carry on  
We're coming in on a wing and a prayer  
(A wing and a prayer).  
Watta show, what a fight  
(Watta show, watta fight)  
  
Yup, we really hit our target for tonight  
(Hit our target tonight)  
How we sing as we lift through the air  
(We lift while we are singing)  
  
Look below, there's our field over there  
(Over there)  
With a full throttle on and our struts in a storm  
We're coming in on a wing
