It's our last chance to share the stage  
Before we go our separate ways  
High school wasn't meant to last forever  
It's our last chance for us to shine  
To bring you music one more time  
  
So come on, come on, come on  
(Come on, come on, come on)  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
W I L D, Wildcats, you know we are  
W I L D, Wildcats, come on, come on  
East High boys, let's make some noise, oh yeah  
W I L D, Wildcats, now's the time  
  
This is the last time to get it right  
This is the last chance to make it our night  
We gotta show what we're all about  
Team, work together  
  
This is the last chance to make our mark  
History will know who we are  
This is the last time to make it count  
It's now or never, yeah  
  
I want it all, I want it, want it, want it  
The fame and the fortune and more, I want it all  
I want it, want it, want it  
I gotta have my star on the door  
  
I want the world, nothing less  
All the glam and the press  
Only giving me the best reviews  
I want it all, want it all, want it all  
Want it all, want it all  
Kick it girls  
  
I want it all, want it all, want it all  
Want it all, want it all, we want it  
My band, thank you, East High  
You're amazing, good night  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
I gotta lot of things I have to do  
All these distractions, our future's coming soon  
We're being pulled a hundred different directions  
But whatever happens, I know I've got you  
  
You're on my mind, you're in my heart  
It doesn't matter where we are  
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart  
Even if we're miles apart  
Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart  
  
All, I wanna do is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can't do, eww  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
And no matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart  
  
A-a-achoo, I just wanna be with, eww, you  
You know how life can be, it changes overnight  
It's sunny then raining, but it's alright  
A friend like you always makes it easy  
I know that you get me  
  
Every time  
Through every up, through every down  
You know I'll always be around  
Through anything, you can count on me  
  
All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can do  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart, you know it's true  
  
I just wanna be with you, you, I just wanna be with you  
The sun will always shine, that's how you made me feel  
We're gonna be alright, 'cause what we have is real  
And will always be together  
  
All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can do  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart, you know it's true  
I just wanna be with you, all I wanna do!  
  
All that I wanna do is be with you  
All that I wanna do is be with you  
All that I wanna do, I just wanna be with you  
All that I wanna do, I just wanna be with you  
  
Who's that girl? She's so fine  
Who's that girl? I don't recognize  
Who's that girl? She looks so good, yeah  
Guess we've never really noticed  
But we've probably should  
  
Big fun on the night of nights  
The night of nights, tonight  
Let's dance on the night of nights  
You know we're gonna do it right  
It's gonna be our night  
  
You know it, to remember for all time  
Surprise, big fun, it's gonna be the night  
The best, to last forever, the rest of our lives  
We'll never, ever, ever forget  
  
It's gonna be my night, oh yeah  
All together, say it loud  
Come on now, everyone, that's right!  
It's gonna be a night  
You can bet to remember  
Hear the crowd  
  
And never, ever, ever  
Never, ever, ever, never, ever  
Never, ever, ever forget!
