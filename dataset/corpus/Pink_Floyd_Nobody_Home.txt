"Alright, I'll take care of them part of the time, but there's somebody else
that needs taking care of in Washington"  
"Who's that?"  
"Rose Pilchitt!"  
"Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?"  
"36-24-36 does that answer your question?"  
"Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!"  
"Who's she?"  
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961 ... "  
  
I've got a little black book with my poems in.  
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.  
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.  
  
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on.  
Got those swollen hand blues.  
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from.  
I've got electric light.  
And I've got second sight.  
I got amazing powers of observation.  
And that is how I know  
When I try to get through  
On the telephone to you  
There'll be nobody home.  
  
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.  
And the inevitable pinhole burns  
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.  
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.  
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.  
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.  
  
I've got wild staring eyes.  
And I've got a strong urge to fly.  
But I got nowhere to fly to.  
Ooooh, babe when I pick up the phone  
  
"Surprise, surprise, surprise..."  
There's still nobody home.  
  
I've got a pair of Gohills boots  
But I got fading roots.
