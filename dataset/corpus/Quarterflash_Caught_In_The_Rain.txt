In the eye of the storm you found me  
I was caught in the rain like you  
And it pulled us down together  
And it tangled us in blue  
Oh, all of my life  
I wanted that night  
Together and still it remains  
I still hear the rain  
I can't get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
I'll wait for you forever  
Cause I'm still caught in the rain  
  
They say the eye of the storm is quiet  
And that's where I'll wait for you  
They say dreams can show us answers  
Oh, baby, I hope that's true  
Cause night after night  
I dream of a light  
That shows me, back through the rain  
I find you again  
I can't get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
I'll wait for you forever  
Cause I'm still caught in the rain  
  
Oh, all of my life  
I wanted that night  
Together and still it remains  
I still hear the rain  
I can't get it out of my heart  
  
And I will wait for you forever  
No matter what you do or say  
I'll wait for you forever  
Cause I'm still caught in the rain
