My God can never fail  
He's beem proved time and again  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need  
  
He's never early never late  
It takes courage and it takes faith  
Trust Him you'll see he's got  
All the power you need  
  
He saves forgives and heals  
He takes back what the devil steals  
My debt's paid in full  
And every day He does miracles  
  
God dreams turn them into plans  
Too big for human hands  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need  
  
He's real He's real  
Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel  
He's real He's real  
I'm believing for miracles  
  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need
