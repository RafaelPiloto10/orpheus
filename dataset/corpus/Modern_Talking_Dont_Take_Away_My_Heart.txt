Electrify my heart, electrify my soul  
Oh baby don't, don't lose control  
Electrify my skin, electrify my brain  
Oh baby don't leave me again  
No matter what I do, I do it just for you  
Love will last forever  
You are a part of me, I'm not to blind to see  
We'll stay together  
  
Refrain: Don't take away my heart  
Don't break it and depart  
I'll be right here next to you  
Don't take away my heart  
Don't break it and depart  
When my heart beats, oh it's true  
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, don't say it's over  
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, I'll be your lover  
  
Electrify my life, electrify the rain  
Tell me the number of heaven again  
Electrify my night, electrify my time  
You are always on my mind  
Why do I love you so, cannot let you go  
Dreams will last forever  
The way you look tonight, lighting up my life  
Lets stay together  
  
I will stay, I will go, oh my baby let me know  
I will die, I will steal, baby if your love is real
