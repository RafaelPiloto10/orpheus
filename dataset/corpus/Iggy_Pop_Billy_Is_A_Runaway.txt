Billy was a Bird dog  
He pulled up in a Bonneville  
I went to see my manager  
He usually handles these things  
  
Billy pulled his wallet  
Full of hundred dollar bills  
Took me for a joyride  
Talkin' 'bout the stereo  
Drivin' in the left lane  
I'm thinkin' 'bout my burial  
  
We pulled into the liquor store  
And he was underage  
And all he said to me was  
Put your money away  
  
'Cause Billy is a runaway  
  
Billy's got a Family  
Gonna skin him alive  
His dope dealing sister  
Wants him to join the enterprise  
  
I leave him at the motel  
They can talk it all over  
His sister's got a baby now  
And Billy hardly knows her  
  
Well I'm a friendly kind of guy  
And I had to have him over  
I gave him a drink  
What do you think  
His hands start shakin'  
His boots start quakin'  
  
Billy is a runaway [Repeat: x4]  
  
Runaway [Repeat: x3]  
  
His hands start shakin'  
His boots start quakin'  
  
Runaway baby  
  
Billy is a runaway [Repeat: x2]
