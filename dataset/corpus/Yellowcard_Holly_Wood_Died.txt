Accidents out on the highway to somewhere,  
They tell us about when we're young,  
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes  
Before she can see what they've done ,  
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round,  
The last fight was fixed from the start,  
Names on her sidewalks they move through her body,  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
You're flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you  
  
Night life the highlife she just wants a good life  
So someone remembers her too  
But somewhere she heard there was someplace to go  
When you die when you live like we do  
Die when you live like we do  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
I'm finding a way now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
You're flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you
