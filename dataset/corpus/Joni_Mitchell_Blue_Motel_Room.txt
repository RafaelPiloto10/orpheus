I've got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
I've got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when I'm down  
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain  
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when I get back to town  
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on  
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm  
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles  
Honey, tell them you've got germs  
I hope you'll be thinking of me  
Because I'll be thinking of you  
While I'm traveling home alone  
Tell those girls that you've got Joni  
She's coming back home  
  
I've got road maps  
From two dozen states  
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town  
It's funny how these old feelings hang around  
You think they're gone  
No, no  
They just go underground  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to L.A. town  
You and me, we're like America and Russia  
We're always keeping score  
We're always balancing the power  
And that can get to be a cold cold war  
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk  
In some neutral cafe  
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey  
And I'll lay down the highway  
  
I've got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
I've got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town
