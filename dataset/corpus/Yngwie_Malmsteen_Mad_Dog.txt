Ever since that day  
I met you  
Well I just knew  
You must be mad  
But that's okay  
Cause I've been thinking  
And I've had worse  
It ain't that bad  
But now it has reached  
Another level  
A lesser man would be scared  
Live as you preach  
And not as the devil  
We're all the same  
Breathing air  
Mad  
Mad  
Mad dog  
Mad, mad dog  
Mad dog  
Mad, mad dog  
Now it's too late  
Much too late  
To fix your problem  
Your brain is dead  
You should have tried  
To set it straight  
Now you missed that boat  
And that's what I always said  
You're mad  
Mad  
Mad dog  
Mad, mad dog  
Mad dog  
Mad  
Mad dog  
Mad, mad dog  
Yeah  
I'm gonna put you down, down
