For all the love we've made  
Just one thing stays the same  
The lamp gets dusty  
The pipes get rusty  
But I don't wanna wash my hands clean  
  
Well you say you love me too  
Then why won't you go through  
With the nightly kisses  
With the hits and the misses  
Well if you can make it on your own...  
  
Then go if you want to go  
But stay if you want to know the way  
Through the mess we've made  
Or lie in the bed you know or go  
  
I heard your moving van  
But I did not take a stand  
You can't leave with 'em  
You can't leave without 'em  
I never thought I'd want to let you...  
  
Go if you want to go  
Or stay if you want to know the way  
Through the mess we've made  
Or lie in the bed you know or go
