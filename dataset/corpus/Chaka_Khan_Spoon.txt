I got me some cookin'  
Not all that good lookin'  
He's mighty sweet to me  
That's how he's keepin' me  
I ain't worried 'bout the future  
The here and now is lookin' cuter  
I like his recipe  
That's why I'm layin'  
You are just like my favorite spoon  
'Cause you stir me up  
I'm as full as a harvest moon  
Still I need more in my cup  
And only you can give it to me  
Am I happy?  
(I think so)  
Don't be so emotional  
(I can't help it, no)  
Will he be there?  
(I think so)  
It's one thing that I do know  
This I know  
Everybody needs to feel it  
Can't beg, borrow or steal it  
Love is all about lovin'  
When it's hot like an oven  
I ain't worried 'bout the future  
The here and now is lookin' cuter  
Got plenty o' time for sortin'  
'Cause Mama's little baby loves her shortnin' bread  
You are just like my favorite spoon  
'Cause you stir me up  
I'm as full as a harvest moon  
Still I need more in my cup  
And only you can give it to me
