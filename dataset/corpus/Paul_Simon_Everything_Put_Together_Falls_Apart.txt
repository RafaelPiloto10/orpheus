Paraphernalia  
Never hides your broken bones  
And I don't know why  
You want to try  
  
It's plain to see you're on your own  
Oh, I ain't blind, no  
Some folks are crazy  
Others walk that borderline  
Watch what you're doing  
  
Taking downs to get off to sleep  
And ups to start you on your way  
After a while they'll change your style  
I see it happening every day  
  
Oh spare your heart  
Everything put together  
Sooner or later falls apart  
There's nothing to it, nothing to it  
  
And you can cry  
You can lie  
For all the good it'll do you  
You can die  
  
But when it's done  
And the police come, and they lay you down for dead  
Just remember what I said
