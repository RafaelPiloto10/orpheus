Let me tell you a story  
Let me shovel some dirt  
Long time no sugar  
And it's starting to hurt  
Something's flattening my cola  
Something's wrong with my brew  
Something's rotten in idaho  
And I don't know what to do  
Going going gone with the red eye distress  
Going going gone on the red eye express  
Only go around once  
Gotta quench that thirst  
Gotta grab that gusto  
Gotta get there first
