Eat through the mounds of steel,  
Sift through the metal.  
Belly full, another deal,  
Stopping would be fatal!  
Round 'n' round spins a forty-five,  
Is it vinyl or a bullet?  
One to kill one keeps alive,  
Get on your knees and suck it!  
  
Looking down the barrel, the feeling of new power  
Look up the weasel! Feel the reign of terror!  
  
Crawling scratching to stay alive  
He's lying on his belly.  
One finger needed to rip apart,  
The soul Belial carries.  
Point your finger, scream in vain,  
Not a soul is listening!  
Never fast, you'll feel the pain,  
Long cold barrel glistening!  
  
Down the dead end street, he strikes to kill the weed.  
I call the Devil, laughing as you bleed.  
  
Prepare for your new life.  
Satan waits, to, night!!!  
  
No one cried when it was over,  
Your life it had no meaning.  
Even friends of J.A.R.  
Quickly lost all feelings.  
You had warnings, you had time,  
Well that was all you gave it.  
Said one day you'd be mine,  
Your life you couldn't save it!!!  
  
Angels raining down, stories that they tell.  
J.J. played with fire! now he burns in Hell.  
  
Prepare for your new life.  
Satan waits to, night!  
  
Higher! Higher! Feel the fire!  
She burns at the stake like a witch!  
Kill her! Slash her, slit her throat!  
There's nothing I dispise more, than a bitch!!!  
Burn her tonight!  
Run, hide from the Demon's fate,  
To late, the fire is lit!!!  
  
Come in a sit for awhile  
Come in and feel the fire.  
Feel the heat, feel the fire,  
Fire of desire!!!  
Fall in! Fall in! Ahahahaha  
Feel the fire!!!
