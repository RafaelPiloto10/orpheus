Who's loving you now  
  
Heard things about you  
They said you had changed your ways  
I can't stand to talk about the past  
It's all over now  
Living with this lonely heart  
Surviving each moment without you  
Never thought of being this way before  
Hmmmmm now I want to know  
  
Chorus:  
Who's loving you now?  
Who's holding your heart and mind?  
Who's loving you now?  
I wanna know who's loving you  
  
It's been years without you  
  
Then why do I dream of you  
Afraid that this heart still beats for you  
Hoooo... Now I want to know  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Bridge:  
Things have changed  
And time has erased  
The feelings that you once had wooooo  
But I can't deny  
Nothing seems to defy the moments of love  
We have shared in time...  
  
Repeat chorus  
Who's loving you now?  
Who's holding your heart and mind?  
Who's loving you now?
