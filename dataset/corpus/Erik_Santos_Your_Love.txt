You're the one that never lets me sleep  
To my mind, down to my soul you touch my lips  
You're the one that I can't wait to see  
With you here by my side i'm in ecstasy  
  
[refrain]  
I am all alone without you  
My days are dark without a glimpse of you  
But you came into my life  
I feel complete  
The flowers bloom, my morning shines  
And I can see  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Every time I hear our music play  
Reminds me of the things that we've been through  
In my mind I can't believe it's true  
But in my heart the reality is you  
  
Coz' I am all alone without you  
My days are dark without a glimpse of you  
But you came into my life  
I feel complete  
The flowers bloom, my morning shines  
And I can see  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside
