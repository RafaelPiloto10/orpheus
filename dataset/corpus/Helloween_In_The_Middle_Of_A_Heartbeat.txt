Tell me prety girl do you know who I am?  
Have you ever seen me as your friend  
Anything we have is those hungry nights  
But there's so much left unsatisfied  
  
All those little things you told me  
Ain't good enought to show me  
That we're gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more  
I'm still waiting as I did before  
If you only sad that it's not too late  
We could then rely upon our fate  
  
All those little things you tell me  
Could bear enought to show me  
That we're gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm tellin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
That the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
To your heart  
  
I found out, I found out  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And i know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
Together we are still so far apart
