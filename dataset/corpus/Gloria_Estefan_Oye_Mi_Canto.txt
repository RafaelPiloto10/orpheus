Take me only for what I am  
You've got a right to speak your mind  
You've gotta take a stand  
No one has the right to say  
This is right or that is wrong  
It isn't just one way  
Find common ground  
Go in between  
Things aren't always what they seem  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
People, let's give each other room  
If we're gonna work it out  
We better make it soon  
Love is love is such a common word  
When it's pride we mistake for love  
Isn't that absurd  
Why always take  
The upper hand  
It's better to understand  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
I believe in love but with no conditions  
Oye mi canto  
And giving in sometimes  
Doesn't make it submission  
Oye mi canto  
Hate is so common it's almost tradition  
Oye mi canto  
Come on let's leave it behind  
And make that transition  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto
