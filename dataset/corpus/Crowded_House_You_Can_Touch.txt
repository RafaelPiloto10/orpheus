It could spell my mere defeat  
You could find it's what you need  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
My condition is hard to define  
I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind  
See no future from where I stand  
For the present I am in your hands  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
It is only passing through  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
You can touch me  
I won't die
