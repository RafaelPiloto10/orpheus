I'm livin' in a house on the other side of town  
They're makin' a highway so they're rippin' my buildin' down  
I gotta find a place, within a week  
Or else I'll be sleepin' out on the street  
Woe is me, I'm lookin' for a vacancy  
  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
Walkin' up and walkin' down (no vacancy)  
I've been searchin' 'round the town (no vacancy)  
No apartment to be found (no vacancy)  
On my dishwasher's pay (can't find a place to stay)  
  
I found myself a place but the rent sure is a crime  
It's a cold water flat that was built in Lincoln's time  
The paint is peelin' right off of the wall  
Good golly, the bathroom is in the hall  
Woe is me, I'm lookin' for a vacancy  
  
I could budget myself, scrimp and save to get along  
But it ain't no fun givin' up wine, women and song  
So I'll have a roof up above my head  
But under those conditions I would rather be dead  
Woe is me, I'm lookin' for a vacancy  
  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
Walkin' up and walkin' down (no vacancy)  
I've been searchin' 'round the town (no vacancy)  
No apartment to be found (no vacancy)  
On my dishwasher's pay (can't find a place to stay)  
  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
Oh, All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)  
All day long I'm walkin' 'round (no vacancy)
