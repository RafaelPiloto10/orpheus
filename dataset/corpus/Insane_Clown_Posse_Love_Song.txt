Love Song  
"Hello, and welcome back to Pillow Talk  
I hope you're with your bitch  
'cause it's time to get cozy with the ICP  
So wind back with a sparkling glass of Faygo  
While Violent J tells you the poetry  
That just makes the bitches melt  
Only on WLUV"  
"Hello, baby  
I was thinking about you  
So I wrote this song  
I like to dedicate this to the love  
That has expressed from you and I  
So just sit back and enjoy"  
[Violent J]  
Eh, yo, bitch, come over here and let me kick it to ya  
Tried to stick my nuts in ya then I never knew ya  
'cause your ugly and you know you can't hide that  
So what you look like a chicken with a hunchback  
Oh, it doesn't matter that you from down south  
If you talk like it, I'm a smack you in your mouth  
Bitch, I admit it, I'm quick to hit a woman hey  
But that's okay, 'cause bitch, I'm Violent J  
And I'm a southwest mack daddy juggalo  
And you're nothing but a two-bit stankin' ho  
But I love you and I hope you realize that  
I don't care about the hair growing out your back  
Smoking that blunt, drink some Mad Dog through the night  
And your ugly bitch turns into Karen White  
And I stick my wing-wang in the middle  
I like a filthy-ass ho, the kind that make your nuts shrivle  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Bitch, I'm knocking at your door  
Let me get some neden, ho  
Bitch, you're ugly, that's okay  
I'm finna hit it anyway  
[Violent J]  
I guess you want me to take you on a big date  
But what you're saying don't sound all that straight  
All I want to do is feel your butt and squeeze your titties  
'cause I can't feed your fat ass on a buck fifty  
Let's make love my sweet little dove  
I wouldn't get near that neden without a glove  
'cause it's rats and spiders up in there  
Hittin that'll take the curl out your nut hairs  
I smack your tittie and claps when it hits the other  
But I don't want em clappin too loud it'll wake your mother  
Bitches always front like they don't want to let you hit  
But then they always screamin banshees when you gettin with it  
So don't fake the funk, I'm nothing but a ghetto punk  
All I'm trying to do is stick you in your fat rump  
So get the fuck out them dirty-ass drawers  
And come and twist my balls 'cause I love you  
[Chorus (5x)]  
"You and I both know  
That I've been wrong to you in the past  
And I know that I love you  
All I want to do is slide my wang into your neden  
I want to hit that neden so damn hard  
Let my nuts bang on your anus  
That's my only true desire  
I feel for you, I think for you  
I breathe for you  
All I want is a little neden  
Ya know, everyday when the wind blows  
All I hear is my nuts flapping against your booty, ho  
And that's all I ever want  
And that's all I ever dreamed of  
That is you and your neden, bitch"
