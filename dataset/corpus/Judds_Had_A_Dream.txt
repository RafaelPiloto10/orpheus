Had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and I woke up cryin'  
Well, I can try but I just can't stop  
And the time is draggin' by, tick-tock  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
  
Well, I'm high and dry and lonely  
I'm as lonesome as can be  
And I stare out of my window  
Well, I can play but I just can't win  
And the weather's lookin' mighty grim  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my heart, it can't love no one but you  
My heart can't love no one but you  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
Oh my heart can't love no one but you  
My heart can't love no one but you  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
  
Had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and I woke up cryin'  
Well, I can try but I just can't stop  
And the time is draggin' by, tick-tock  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you
