Ah, don't let me grow bitter I pray  
Give me strength to carry on my way  
  
I'm leanin' on you like a wooden cane  
Well, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
I'm believin' there's a reason for this trial'  
This too shall pass in a little while  
Whoa, Lord have mercy if I complain  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth, courage in my ears  
  
Well, when I'm hurtin' I have a dangerous tongue  
I lose it and use it like a gun  
Oh wont you stop me if you see me takin' aim  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
If I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth, courage in my ears  
Remind me when I reach the other side  
I'll b thankful for every tear that I cries  
  
Don't let the darkness drive me insane  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
If I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain
