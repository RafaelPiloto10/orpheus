God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I believe there's a time and a place  
To let your mind drift and get out of this place  
I believe there's a day and a place  
That we will go to, and I know you want to share.  
  
There's no secret to living (There's no secret to living)  
Just keep on walking  
There's no secret to dying (There's no secret to dying)  
Just keep on flying.  
  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
I'm gonna die in a space that don't hold my fame.  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls.  
  
I believe there's a time when the cord of life  
Should be cut, my friends (Cut the cord, my friend)  
I believe there's a time when the cord can be cut  
And this vision ends (Let this vision end).  
  
But I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
And I'm gonna cry in a space that don't hold my fame.  
  
Walking in the cold  
Just keep on flying  
There'll be a searchlight  
On the mountain high  
  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I'm a lonely soul.  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name.  
  
God knows you are lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
I'm a lonely soul.  
  
So long, little chapel  
Pack up your light  
Pack up your light  
Say goodbye to the holy water life  
Oh  
Ah
