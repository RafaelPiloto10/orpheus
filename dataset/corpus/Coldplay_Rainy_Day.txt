Then there was rain  
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray  
At night it was the bright of the moon with me  
Time just floated away  
  
Then there was rain  
The town's foundations were crumbling  
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling  
And time just floated away  
We can watch it and stay and we can listen  
  
Oh, rainy day, come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
And we're separated now  
I'm down  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house  
  
Then there was rain  
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain  
My lonely little heart would've broke again  
Times were vicious  
  
Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win  
You win but with less than when you begin  
Deeper that the knife goes in  
Oooooooooooooooh  
  
Ooh, rainy day come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
We're separated now  
I'm down  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house  
  
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah  
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah  
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah  
  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house
