I saw you coming  
I called your name  
You couldn't hear me  
You walked on by  
  
Something's changed  
Everything's rearranged  
You didn't see me  
You didn't answer  
  
I was invisible to your cause  
I tried to tell you  
I was your friend  
You just kept walking  
Like it was the end  
  
Let's talk  
Tell me all about it  
Let's talk  
What could it hurt now?  
Let's talk  
Won't you tell me what is wrong, yeah?  
Let's talk  
We can work it out, somehow  
  
I saw you coming  
You wore a wig  
I wanted to laugh  
But you looked so serious  
  
I say let's talk  
And you just walk  
  
How was I  
To approach you?  
You really left no room  
  
Run out in the crowd  
If you really want to,  
But why not try  
For something new?
