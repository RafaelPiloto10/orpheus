Turn on the radio take a listen  
What you're missing  
Personally I'm sick of the ass kissing  
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation  
Nowhere in the nation  
Program directors and DJ's ignored me  
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty  
And top thirty top twenty and top ten  
Until you put more hip hop in  
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the see  
And go and dis me in a magazine  
How could you figure the brother could dig ya  
DJ face down in the river  
No it's not a threat but a promise  
I'm as  
Crazy as they come see  
Mama didn't love me  
All I got is my nine  
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine  
  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Turn off that motherfucking radio!  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Turn off that motherfucking radio!  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Play the music motherfucker put the music on  
Damn!  
  
Tune in to the radio listen for a minute  
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it  
Cause all the radio do is gangle  
That R and B love triangle  
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers  
You don't care about lovers  
You want to hear a young nigga on the mic  
Going buck wild  
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles  
That's where I'm coming from  
Reality that's what they're running from  
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know  
Yo turn off the radio  
  
You know what? You know what?  
Basically those black guys and those rap guys  
They don't know what the fuck they're doing  
I hate those fuckers  
I hate em  
Especially that one guy  
The AmeriKKKa's most wanted  
Ice Cube, I hate that fucker  
Get him off the air, get him off, get him off  
Get that rap shit out of here!  
Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!
