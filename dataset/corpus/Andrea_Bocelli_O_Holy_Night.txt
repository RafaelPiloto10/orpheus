O holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
This is the night of our dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night Divine!  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night  
O night divine  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand  
So led by the light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men and from the Orient land  
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night Divine!  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night  
O night Divine!
