It's me, it's me my darling, you know I've been away  
I've been away a long-long while  
Longin' to see your pretty smile  
Darling yes oh darling, you're the one, the one  
Oh darling, you're the one  
'Cause my heart beats but there's no glow  
Won't you say you love me, so I'll know, I'll know  
Love me, so I'll know  
It's me, it's me my darling, you know I've been away  
All day I think my heart's alone  
Don't you know I want you for my own, my own  
Want you for my own  
Well, darling yes oh darling, the time has come to part  
I'll be gone a long-long while  
I want to see your pretty smile  
Darling yes oh darling, you're my heart, my heart  
Darling you're my heart  
'Cause my heart beats but there' s no glow  
Won't you say you love me, so I'll know, I'll know  
Love me, so I'll know  
Love me, so I'll know
