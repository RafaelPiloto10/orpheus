Broken clouds along the blue horizon  
The sun is setting and the wind is dying down  
Outward bound, there is music all around  
Can you hear it, it's the song of the sea  
  
Soundings taken at the edge of darkness  
The widest silences the heart can ever hear  
You can steer to the stars along your lee  
Set you bearings to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry you away, so far away  
Trim my sails to greet the breaking morning  
Past the headlands to the rolling open sea  
And it comes to me, I have never felt so free  
As when I'm listening to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry me away, so far away  
Some were meant to watch the world from windows  
And never look beyond the road beneath their feet  
But for me, I was always meant to be  
One forever chasing the song of the sea  
  
The song of the sea  
The song of the sea
