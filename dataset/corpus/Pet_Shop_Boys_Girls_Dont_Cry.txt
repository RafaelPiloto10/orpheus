Somewhere out in the heart of Suburbia  
Flinching from the words  
That could almost murder her  
Listen, it's the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
She's wearin' plaid and jeans  
Like a workman on the road  
Hitchin' out west  
With a personal stereo  
Playin' "Lay, lady, lay"  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
In her heart she's not even a renegade  
From the start she knew  
Why she would not be saved  
All her instincts lead a different way  
In the pocket by her heart  
Is a dog-eared Polaroid  
A picture of a girl with her arm 'round a boy  
Who went missing the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
(I don't care what they say)  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
(I don't care what they say)  
Girls don't cry
