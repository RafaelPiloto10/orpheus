Ten p.m. ten to four  
And I came to hit the floor  
Thought you knew b4  
But if you don't then now u know  
Yo tonight I'm 'bout to mash  
Make them other chicks so mad  
I'm 'bout to I shake my ass  
Snatch that boy so fast  
Make dem other bitches mad  
  
It's all about me and you  
Doin' how we do  
Tear the floor up up  
Tell 'em to make room  
If they wanna know  
Tell 'em mind their own  
But if they wanna look  
We can give 'em a encore  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it a  
Freakshow freakshow  
We can give 'em a  
Peepshow, peepshow  
Don't stop it let it flow  
Let your inhibitions go  
It's a crazy night  
Let's make a make a freakshow  
  
Make it a  
Freakshow, a freakshow a freakshow  
Make it a  
Freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow  
  
Make 'em they clap when we perform  
Wanna see crazy we can show 'em  
Dancing table top freaky freaky  
So outside the norm  
On some super star ish  
Pushin' hot Bugatti whips  
Rockin' new designer fits  
We can do it if you wit it  
  
It's all about me and you  
Doin' how we do  
Tear the floor up up  
Tell 'em to make room  
If they wanna know  
Tell 'em mind their own  
But if they wanna look  
We can give 'em a encore  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it a  
Freakshow freakshow  
We can give 'em a  
Peepshow, peepshow  
Don't stop it let it flow  
Let your inhibitions go  
It's a crazy night  
Let's make a make a freakshow  
  
Me and my girls 'bout to get it on  
Grab us a couple boys to go  
Me and my girls 'bout to get it on  
Grab us a couple boys to go
