Style must not be underrated  
Style is often overlooked  
Style is never in the papers  
I read it like an open book  
Style  
If you can't see the substance  
Style shows how it's organized  
Style is looking for your money  
It's in the way you paint your eyes  
There is always a way  
A way things are done  
I've been learning my ABC's  
I know what is 10, I know what is 1 in  
Style is a naked look  
Underneath your style  
Style of a different place  
Talking through your style  
Even the way you hide it  
Reveals the thing you hide  
Your style may never cause a riot  
It's still a style to have no style  
There is always a way  
To light up  
It's been a crazy year all around  
The check never came  
I can't let it cramp my  
Style is a world for sale  
You can't buy this style  
Style that you can't resist  
You won't cramp my style
