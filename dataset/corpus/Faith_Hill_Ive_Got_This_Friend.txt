I've got this friend who is lonely  
She's afraid she'll never find her one and only  
A little shy but she can be fun  
If the right guy came along  
Would you know someone  
  
I've got this friend and it sounds crazy  
But he's been feeling that way too a whole lot lately  
And interested, oh I'm sure he'd be  
I can almost speak for him  
He's that close to me  
  
Maybe in each other  
They might find the lover  
They've been missin' until now  
They'd trust the judgment of  
Two friends like us who care so much  
Can we get them together?somehow  
  
I've got this friend  
Yeah, I think I know her  
My arms can almost feel the way he'd hold her  
It's like he's here when you describe him  
And if he's anything like you I'm sure she'd like him  
  
Maybe in each other  
They might find the lover  
They've been missin' until now  
They'd trust the judgment of  
Two friends like us who care so much  
Can we get them together?somehow  
  
Can we get together?I've got this friend
