I never seen you looking so bad my funky one  
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone  
  
[Chorus]  
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend  
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again  
When the demon is at your door  
In the morning it won't be there no more  
Any major dude will tell you  
  
Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine  
The people on the street have all seen better times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do  
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you  
  
[Chorus]
