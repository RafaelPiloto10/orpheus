I'm bleeding out  
Said if the last thing that I do  
Is to bring you down  
I'll bleed out for you  
So I peel my skin  
And I count my sins  
And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
  
When the day has come  
But I've lost my way around  
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground  
When the sky turns gray  
And everything is screaming  
I will reach inside  
Just to find my heart is beating  
  
You tell me to hold on  
Oh you tell me to hold on  
But innocence is gone  
And what was right is wrong  
  
'Cause I'm bleeding out  
Said if the last thing that I do  
Is to bring you down  
I'll bleed out for you  
So I peel my skin  
And I count my sins  
And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
  
When the hour is nigh  
And hopelessness is sinking in  
And the wolves all cry  
To feel they're not worth hollering  
When your eyes are red  
And emptiness is all you know  
With the darkness fed  
I will be your scarecrow  
  
You tell me to hold on  
Oh you tell me to hold on  
But innocence is gone  
And what was right is wrong  
  
'Cause I'm bleeding out  
Said if the last thing that I do  
Is to bring you down  
I'll bleed out for you  
So I peel my skin  
And I count my sins  
And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you  
  
'Cause I'm bleeding out  
Said if the last thing that I do  
Is to bring you down  
I'll bleed out for you  
So I peel my skin  
And I count my sins  
And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
