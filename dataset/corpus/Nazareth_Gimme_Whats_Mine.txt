Well only you know what your thinkin'  
Come on say what's on your mind  
Tell me one way or the other  
I ain't got much time  
Gimme what's mine, gimme what's mine  
  
Well I don't want you to be wastin'  
All my lovin' or my time  
So I got to know the story  
I know we can be so fine  
Please gimme what's mine, gimme what's mine  
  
How can I get through to you woman  
I think your lovin' is fine  
Only want what's given  
Only give you what's mine  
  
Yeah sometimes when I see you  
I'm scared to state my case  
Got to take my chances  
Will you leave or will you stay?  
Got to know the way, got to know the way  
  
I'm so tired of waitin'  
Somethin' that I got to know  
If there's one chance that you love me  
Then we got to let it grow  
We got to let it grow, we got to let it grow  
  
I just got to get through to you woman  
I want your lovin' so bad  
I'll take all that you give me  
I'll give you all that's mine.
