Masks and a fake skin.  
The builders keep breaking  
The buzzing.  
Attracted to the innocent.  
The wolves lead the sheep.  
The buzzing.  
  
With a stare to crush their hopes and water.  
To drown the flies.  
their hands fall apart when we need to hold them.  
And the skeleton speaks of what we've told them.  
The buzzing.  
They stare with the eyes of wolves, and the hearts of dead.  
The builders keep breaking
