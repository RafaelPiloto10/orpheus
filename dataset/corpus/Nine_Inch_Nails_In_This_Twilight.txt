Watch the sun  
As it crawls across a final time  
And it feels like  
Like it was a friend  
  
It is watching us  
And the world we set on fire  
Do you wonder  
If it feels the same?  
  
And the sky is filled with light  
Can you see it?  
All the black is really white  
If you believe it  
  
As your time is running out  
Let me take away your doubt  
You can find a better a place  
In this twilight  
  
Dust to dust  
Ashes in your hair remind me  
What it feels like  
And I won't feel again  
  
Night descends  
Could I have been a better person?  
If I could only do it all again...  
  
And the sky is filled with light  
Can you see it?  
All the black is really white  
If you believe it  
And the longing that you feel  
You know none of this is real  
You will find a better a place  
In this twilight
