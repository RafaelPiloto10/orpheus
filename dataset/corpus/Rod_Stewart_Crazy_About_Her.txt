I walk the street at night  
until the morning light comes shining through  
Can't get a good night's sleep  
ain't been to work in weeks  
  
What am I gonna do?  
Help me  
  
Can't get her off my mind  
I'm drinking too much wine  
I'm burning up inside  
If I could touch her face  
or take her out some place I'd be satisfied  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her  
  
I see her jogging in Central Park  
with one of them Walkman's on her head  
She was hot, young, beautiful  
and I said to myself  
she's destined to be mine  
  
I see her every day  
in rush hour or subway, in a grocery store  
She don't notice me  
I might as well just be a crockroach on the floor  
  
If she belonged to me I'd give her everything  
I'd never cheat or lie  
I treat her with respect, not just a sex object  
I ain't that kind of guy  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her  
  
I was standing outside the Met one day  
when she drove by in a black Corvette  
I said Hey baby  
I could've died, she looked straight through me  
But I know she's destined to be mine  
  
Every night I stand around her door and wait for her to come by  
She lives in one of those brownstones with the guard outside  
and the limousines and the Rolls Royces comin' and goin'  
  
My friends all say she's way outta my class  
but I know if she'd just get know me  
I could give her something all those rich guys ain't got  
  
Ain't gonna bide my time ain't gonna stand in line  
Somebody gonna get burned  
But, oh the problem is I think my love's at risk  
She's the boss's girl  
Oh no  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her
