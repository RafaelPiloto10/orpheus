[Verse 1]  
  
[Harry]  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
Something deep inside me I can't give up  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
  
[Niall]  
I'm feeling something deep inside  
Hotter than the dead stream burning up  
I got a feeling deep inside  
It's taking, it's taking all I've got  
Yeah, it's taking, its taking all I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
Cos nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
Maybe we're fireproof  
  
[Liam]  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Louis]  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
Riding on a wind and I won't give up  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
You must be fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Bridge]  
[All]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
  
[Outro]  
  
[Zayn]  
It's been so long it's been so long  
  
[Harry]  
Maybe we're fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do
