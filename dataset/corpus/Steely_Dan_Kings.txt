Now they lay his body down  
Sad old men who run this town  
I still recall the way  
He led the charge and saved the day  
Blue blood and rain  
I can hear the bugle playin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
We seen the last of Good King Richard  
Ring out the past his name lives on  
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher  
Raise up your glass to Good King John  
  
While he plundered far and wide  
All his starving children cried  
And though we sung his fame  
We all went hungry just the same  
He meant to shine  
To the end of the line  
  
[Chorus:]  
We seen the last of Good King Richard  
Ring out the past his name lives on  
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher  
Raise up your glass to Good King John
