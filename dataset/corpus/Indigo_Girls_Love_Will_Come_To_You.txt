Guess I wasn't the best one to ask  
Me myself with my face pressed  
Up against love's glass  
To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for  
The one I never could afford  
The wide world spins and spits turmoil  
And the nations toil for peace  
But the paws of fear upon your chest  
Only love can soothe that beast  
And my words are paper tigers  
No match for the predators of pain inside her  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
I was born under the sign of cancer  
(Love will come to you)  
Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer  
(Love will come)  
I'm always closing my eyes and wishing I'm fine  
(I close my eyes and wish you fine)  
Even though I know I'm not this time  
(Even though I know your not this time)  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
Dodging your memories a field of knives  
Always on the outside looking in on other's lives  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
(I have offered up to you)  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
And I wish her insight to battle love's blindness  
Strength from the milk of human kindness  
A safe place for all the pieces that scattered  
Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters
