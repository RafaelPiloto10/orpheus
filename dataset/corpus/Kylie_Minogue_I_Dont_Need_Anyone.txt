I feel like speed  
I feel like liquid  
I give into you  
I melt into you  
I felt like nothing  
I've said and done  
I fall into you  
I fall into you  
  
I don't need anyone  
Except for someone that I don't know  
I don't need anyone  
Except for some one I've not found  
I don't need anyone  
Except for someone that I don't know  
I don't need anyone  
Except for some one I've not found  
  
Your signature  
Is on my hip  
A kiss from you  
Still on my lip  
I am entire  
I am finally one  
But the the moment  
Is long gone  
  
I don't need anyone  
Except for someone that I don't know  
I don't need anyone  
Except for some one I've not found  
I don't need anyone  
Except for someone that I don't know  
I don't need anyone  
Except for some one I've not found
