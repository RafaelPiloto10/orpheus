Lead vocal: the flying pickets  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
I was talking to a man  
And I saw he wore a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I caught and ate a whale  
Then I woke up feeling hungry, he said  
That's a curious tale  
For a dream contains a wish  
In this case a giant fish  
As the pressure you were under  
Might have woken you from slumber  
To relieve the pangs of hunger  
You just dreamed yourself a dish  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
For I also met a man  
And he also wore a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where the sun was at it's height  
But my toes were blocks of ice, he said  
Let me get this right  
You are tall and so your feet  
Must protrude beyond the sheet  
While you sleep they're unprotected  
And it's just as I suspected  
You were trying to dream some heat  
  
But there are six white wolves  
In the dead of the night  
On the branch of a tree  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright  
All the better to see  
  
And they have such big ears  
All the better to hear  
And they're listening to me  
  
And they have such sharp teeth  
All the better to eat  
And they're looking at me  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
I was speaking to a man  
But I don't recall a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I turned into a snail  
And he said it is simplicity  
To follow such a trail  
For this creature takes his shell  
Anywhere that he may roam  
  
But work must keep you on the move  
You fear your wife may disapprove  
So in the dream you just remove  
And take along your home  
  
If I step on a line  
Something will happen  
There are rats in a jar  
Something will happen  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright  
All the better to see  
  
And they have such sharp teeth  
All the better to eat  
And they're looking at me  
  
Tell me what they say  
Tell me what can they be  
Tell me what does it mean  
Tell me what do you see

Nothing is what it seems

A world that's made out of dreams

Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
Though I haven't met this man  
So he didn't wear a ring  
It's so funny you should say that  
  
I told him of a dream  
Where I turned into a hat  
That was round and made of fur, would he say  
Nothing wrong with that  
As I sit here in my chair  
I can see your growth is spare  
And it is my observation  
That this caused you much frustration  
So you dreamed a consolation  
To replace the loss of hair  
  
I'm going to be a mother  
I'm going to have a child  
  
There are wolves in the tree  
But the tree never grew  
There are rats in the jar  
But the curse wasn't true  
  
Fantasia  
Nothing is what it seems  
Fantasia  
A world that is made out of dreams
