[Chorus]  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
You can see but you can't hear me  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
You can try but you can't get near me  
I ain't never had the gift of gab  
But I can't talk with my eyes  
When words fail me you won't nail me  
My eyes can tell you lies  
  
Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you  
You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say  
Sticks and stones may break your bones  
But names can never down you  
It only takes two words to blow you away  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody calls me the quiet one  
But you just don't understand  
You can't listen you won't hear me  
With your head stuck in the sand  
I ain't never had time for words that don't rhyme  
My head is in a cloud  
I ain't quiet - everybody else is too loud  
  
Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you  
You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But names can never down you  
It only takes two words to blow you away.
