I'm going home (just hank and his guitar circa 1950)  
When my work here is o'er  
And trials come no more  
On that great day I'm going home  
To live forever more, just o'er on heaven's shore  
When my life here is o'er I'm going home  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm going home, I'm going home  
When my life here is o'er I'm going home  
Won't it be so sweet, to rest at Jesus' feet  
When my life here is o'er I'm going home  
  
I'm traveling in the light  
And my way is clear and bright  
Some glad day I'm going home  
Heading for the pearly gates for there my savior waits  
When my life here is o'er I'm going home  
  
As I travel down life's road  
So heavy is my load  
But some glad day I'm going home  
I'll meet my loved ones there, in that land so bright and fair  
When my life here is o'er I'm going home  
  
[Chorus:]
