Maybe I don't really wanna know  
How your garden grows cos I just want to fly  
Lately, did you ever feel the pain?  
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone  
  
Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die  
Maybe I just want to breathe maybe I just don't believe  
Maybe you're the same as me we see things they'll never see you and I  
were gonna live forever  
  
I said maybe I don't really wanna know  
How your garden grows cos I just want to fly  
Lately, did you ever feel the pain?  
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone  
  
Maybe I will never be all the things that I want to be  
But now is not the time to cry now's the time to find out why  
I think you're the same as me we see things they'll never see you and I  
We're gonna live forever

Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever
