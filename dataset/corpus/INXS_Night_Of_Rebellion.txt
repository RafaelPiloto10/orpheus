Simple matters always seem  
To make things complicated  
I think of ways to understand  
But it all get's away from me  
  
I sense persuasion of a kind  
It wraps itself around me  
The changing message of your love  
Rarely ever reaches me  
  
Not talking only want action  
Once you give in you are through  
This is the night of rebellion  
  
There used to be paint on the walls  
But you're too young for money  
They'd rather paint the whole town red  
Than spend it on what they're told  
  
Summer to winter is never the same  
If it is then it's time to change  
I don't want to rock your sacred boat  
But there's holes in your sacred sails
