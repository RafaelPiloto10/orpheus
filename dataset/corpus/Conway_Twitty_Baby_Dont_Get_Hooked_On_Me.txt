You've got that look in your eyes and it's startin' to worry me  
But I ain't ready for no family ties nobody's gonna hurry me  
Just keep it friendly buy cause I don't want to leave  
Don't start clingin' to me girl cause I can't breathe  
  
Baby baby don't get hooked on me  
Baby baby don't get hooked on me  
Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free  
Baby baby don't get hooked on me  
  
You're a hot blooded woman child and it's warm where you're touchin' me  
But I can tell by your trembling smile you're seeing way too much in me  
Girl don't let your life get tangled up with mine  
Cause I'll just leave you I can't take no clinging vine  
Baby baby don't get hooked on me...  
Baby baby don't get hooked on me...
