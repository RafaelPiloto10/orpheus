We kiss in a shadow, we hide from the moon,  
Our meetings are few and over too soon!  
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard  
When people are near, we speak not a word!  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free!  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see,  
Behold how my lover loves me!  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free!  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see.  
Behold how my lover loves me!
