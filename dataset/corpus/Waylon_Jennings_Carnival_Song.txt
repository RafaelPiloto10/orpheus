I've been quite the traveler ever since I hit the road  
And the Sullen county carnival has been my earn in gold  
I've been quite alone since I remember when  
I turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in.  
  
I used to run the Ferris wheel but that'd be hard to prove  
I can't stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it can't move  
I used to run the carousel hell that's just round and round  
Never liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down.  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.  
  
I was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jaunt  
I can't see throwing rings around things you don't really want  
I could run the roller coaster but that might break my heart  
So much hard travelin' just to wind up where you start.  
  
Now I just work the gateway and I'm pretty satisfied  
Little booth is red and blue and I just sit inside  
I just take your money and give tickets out in trade  
Think about my life and all the promises I made.  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.  
  
Who's running from the things they've left undone.
