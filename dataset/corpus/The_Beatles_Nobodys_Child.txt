As I was slowly passing  
An orphan's home one day,  
I stopped for just a little while  
To watch the children play.  
Alone a boy was standing  
And when I asked him why,  
He turned with eyes that could not see  
And he began to cry.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.  
  
No mummy's arms to hold me  
Or sue me when I cry,  
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  
I wish that I could die.  
I'll walk the streets of heaven  
Where all blinds can see.  
  
And just like for the other kids  
It will be a home for me.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.
