Far away from friends and loved ones  
'Midst the storm, a soldier lay  
Gathered 'round him all his buddies  
Raised his head, we heard him say  
There's a lamp light in the window  
Where an angel from above  
Gently rocked my baby cradle  
With such tender care and love  
Mother dearest, darlin' mother  
It would ease this awful pain  
If she'd sing until I'm sleepin'  
Rock my cradle once again  
'Neath the palms, tonight, he's sleepin'  
On an island far away  
Though the years pass on in sorrow  
I still recall his words today  
There's a lamp light in the window  
Where an angel from above  
Gently rocked my baby cradle  
With such tender care and love  
Mother dearest, darlin' mother  
It would ease this awful pain  
If she'd sing until I'm sleepin'  
Rock my cradle once again
