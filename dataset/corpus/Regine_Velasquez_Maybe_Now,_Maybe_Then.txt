Always in your arms  
I have found a home  
Some where I would run to  
When I feel alone  
Always in your smile  
I have seen the sun  
That have cease to shine  
On everyone  
  
Maybe now maybe then  
I will surely find a friend  
Could it be that all this time  
It's you  
Maybe now maybe then life will  
Be the same again  
Take a look at me and you will see  
  
That more than words can say  
I still love you so  
Please give me the strength  
To somehow meant tonight
