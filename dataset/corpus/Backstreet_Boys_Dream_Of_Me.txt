Let me sleep  
For when I sleep I dream that you are here  
You're mine  
And all my fears are left behind  
  
I float on air  
The nightingale sings  
Gentle lullabies  
So let me close my eyes  
  
And sleep perchance to dream  
So I can see the face I long to touch  
To kiss  
But only dreams can bring me this  
  
So let the moon shine softly on  
The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me  
  
I hide beneath the clouds  
And whisper to the evening star  
They tell me love is just a dream away, dream away, dream away, dream away  
I'll dream away  
  
So let the moon shine softly on  
The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me  
  
Ohhhh, dream of me
