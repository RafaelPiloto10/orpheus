Bye bye, love, goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
I'll see you on the other side  
  
Hurry on, home to bed  
O Claire, you're much younger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire, it's so lonely when you're not there  
Anyone can take me where  
The places, they weren't there, O Claire  
  
I hear your heart from here  
But now you're much stronger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
I swear, gone a place beyond compare  
So lonely when you're not there  
I can step to watch and stare, O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something 'tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love, goodbye  
O my love, goodbye  
  
Hurry on home to bed  
Claire you're much stronger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire, the nights when you're not there  
Is more than I can bear  
Something only we can share, O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something 'tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love, goodbye  
O my love, goodbye  
  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
I'll see you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something 'tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love, goodbye  
O my love  
  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
I'll see you on the other side
