Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the south-land  
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again  
And I think it's a sin  
  
Well I heard Mister Young sing about her  
Well I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A southern man don't need him around any how  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how bout you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you
