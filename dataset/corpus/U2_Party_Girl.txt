I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
And she won't tell me her name  
Oh no, not me  
  
I know a boy, a boy called Trash  
Trash Can  
I know he does all that he can  
Wham Bam  
And she won't tell me his name  
Oh no, not me  
  
When I was three, I thought the world revolved around me  
I was wrong  
And so I sing along  
And if you dance, then dance with me  
  
I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline  
You know what I mean  
  
I think I know what he wants  
I think I know what he wants  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what he wants
