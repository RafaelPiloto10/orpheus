I lose my head  
From time to time  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
We should have been holding each other  
Instead we talked  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
But I asked before  
Your reply was kind and polite  
One wants more  
When one's denied  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
I won't call it love  
But it feels good to have passion in my life  
If there's a battle  
I hope my head always defers to my heart  
In matters of the heart  
  
I guess I'm crazy to think  
I can give you what you don't want  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
I wish that I had the power  
To make these feelings stop  
I lose all self control  
In matters of the heart  
  
I can't believe  
It's so hard to find someone  
To give affection to  
And from whom you can receive  
I guess it's just the draw of the cards  
In matters of the heart  
  
You caught me off guard  
Somehow you reached me  
Where I thought I had nothing left inside  
I've learned my lesson I've been edified  
In matters of the heart  
  
I've spent my nights  
Where the sleeping dogs lie  
Not by your side  
It feels so lonely  
Once again I've left to much to chance  
In matters of the heart  
  
Here I sit  
I'm feeling sorry for myself  
It's quite a sight  
But I have you to thank  
For reminding me  
We're all alone in this world  
And in matters of the heart  
  
I'm already missing you  
Although we won't say good byes  
Until tomorrow afternoon  
Maybe when and if I see you again  
We'll see eye to eye  
In matters of the heart  
  
I have no harsh words for you  
I have no tears to cry  
If the moon were full  
I'd be howling inside  
It only hurts  
In matters of the heart  
  
If today were my birthday  
I'd be reborn  
As bronte's bird a bird that could fly  
And all accounts would be settled  
In matters of the heart  
  
Matters of the heart
