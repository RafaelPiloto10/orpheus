Don't put your hurt in my heart  
Stop what you're planning before you start  
Yes I loved you once it's true but now I'm over you  
Don't put your hurt in my heart  
Don't put your burning in my eyes  
Cause the burning only stops when I cry  
Once my teardrops fell like rain washed away the burning flame  
And it washed all your hurt from my heart  
Don't put your sorry in my mind  
Cause it's useless and you're only wasting time  
I got over you before I can't chance it anymore  
Don't put your hurt in my heart don't put your hurt in my heart
