Who put fifty tons of shit on the Foreign Office roof?  
Who suffers from nine known diseases?  
Who gets up in the morning when the sun comes up  
And makes their beds, paper clips, bus tickets  
All around their heads?  
Who congregate around Trafalgar Square  
Taking pot shots at the tourists?  
Oh you've got to watch out  
When you wander round the square in the morning  
Cos they're everywhere, they're everywhere  
  
Here we have an honest man  
A civil servant to boot  
He lived high up in the Ministry  
And when he wished to make a point  
He knew just what to do  
His window ledges were all covered in grease  
"I want them out of here"  
  
He said to me, "I want them gone"  
Because you see - Oh don't you see  
None of us are getting any younger  
You've got to follow your nose  
And if it tells you that you've got to go  
Well that's because, they're everywhere,  
They're everywhere  
  
So we called in those men, those horrible men  
We set them to work on the rooftops  
You see their van is very plain  
And I know they're too ashamed  
To wear their by appointment badges anymore  
Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill  
I've often seen them with a gun  
But as the years go by, old habits seem to die  
And nowadays they knockatize them all  
Oh you've got to watch out  
As you wander round the square in the morning  
Oh they're everywhere, they're everywhere
