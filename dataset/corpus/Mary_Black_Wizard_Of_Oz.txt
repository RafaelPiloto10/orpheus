Stars may not align in my favour  
Truth won't be good enough  
I try to make them smile  
But I'm not able  
It's just too far for me to touch  
  
So please if you find it in your heart  
To make me braver in the dark  
I know I'll prove them wrong  
And take the scary thoughts away  
Maybe make me a new brain  
I know I'll prove them wrong  
  
The stars may not align then it's all over  
It's so much out of my control  
I could easily resign chip on my shoulder  
Only faith keeps mine on a roll  
  
And again, I think it might be best  
If you fill the hole inside my chest  
With something more instead  
I do and if it's all the same to you  
Send me home from where I flew  
I know how this will end  
I know how this will end  
  
And please can you find it in your heart  
To make me braver in the dark  
I know I'll prove them wrong  
I do, and if it's all the same to you  
Send me home from where I flew  
I know how this will end  
I know how this will end  
  
Stars may not align in my favour
