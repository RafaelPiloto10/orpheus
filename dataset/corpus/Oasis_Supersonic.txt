I need to be myself  
I can't be no one else  
I'm feeling supersonic  
Give me gin and tonic  
  
You can have it all but how much do you want it?  
You make me laugh  
Give me your autograph  
Can I ride with you in your BMW ?  
  
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine  
You need to find out  
Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about  
You need to find a way for what you want to say  
  
But before tomorrow  
Cause my friend said he'd take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
  
No body can see him  
No body can ever hear him call  
You need to be yourself  
You can't be no one else  
  
I know a girl called Elsa  
She's into Alka Seltzer  
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train  
She made me laugh  
  
I got her autograph  
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter  
She's sniffin in her tissue  
Sellin' the Big Issue  
  
She needs to find out  
Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about  
She needs to find a way for what you want to say  
But before tomorrow  
  
Cause my friend said he'd take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
No body can see him  
  
No body can ever hear him call
