[Chorus]  
I'm the man who murdered love  
Yeah! What do you think to that?  
I'm the man who murdered love  
Yeah! What do you think to that?  
  
He was begging on his bended knee  
For me to put him from his misery  
He hadn't worked at all this century  
Said 'I do a job for all humanity'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I put a bullet in his sugar head  
He thanked me kindly then he lay down dead  
Phony roses blossomed where he bled  
Then all the cheering angels shook my hand and said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh! It's the middle of the song!  
  
Oh! Yeah! Oh! Yeah!  
I'm guilty! I'm guilty!  
I'm guilty! Yeah!  
And then I turned and said  
  
There'll be more pain from broken hearts  
And no more lovers to be torn apart  
Before you throw me in your dungeon dark  
You ougtta film me putting statues up in every park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So dear public, I'm here to confess  
That I'm the one who freed us from this mess  
Love won't be calling at your address  
Cause you've never had you'll never miss, I guess  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you never ever use it  
You know you're gonna lose it  
If you never ever kiss it  
How're you ever gonna miss it?  
  
[Chorus]
