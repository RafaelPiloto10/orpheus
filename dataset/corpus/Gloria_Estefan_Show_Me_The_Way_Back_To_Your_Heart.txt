I remember days, nights were never cold  
I had you in my life, I had you here to hold  
And I remember love warm as a summer day  
But I lost you and I lost my way  
Now I'm in the rain begging you please, please  
  
Baby, won't you show me the way back to your heart?  
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far  
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms  
To your arms  
  
Lead me back  
  
Every night another lonely street I walk down alone  
Searching for a light, your light to lead me home  
Leave a candle in the window and let it shine for me  
Take my hand and take these tears away  
I can't take the pain, I'm on my knees, please  
  
Baby, won't you show me the way back to your heart?  
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far  
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms  
To your arms  
  
Take my hand and take me in your arms  
I'm out in the dark  
Down on my knees, please  
  
Show me the way back to your heart  
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far  
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms  
To your arms, to your arms
