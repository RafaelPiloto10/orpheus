I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, an' deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one o' those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
An' won't it be fine?  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine!  
  
(You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me)  
Come rain or come shine  
(Happy together, unhappy together  
An' won't it be fine?)  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine!  
  
(I'm gonna love you...rain...)  
I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you...
