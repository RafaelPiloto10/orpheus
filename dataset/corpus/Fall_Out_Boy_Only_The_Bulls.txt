[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls  
  
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]  
That right there should make you wanna fan up  
If you a fan that should make you wanna stand up  
If you already standing, put your hands up  
Real high man, try and touch the banners  
It's the home of the champions  
Hard working turn a home into a mansion  
Need you to put your hands up  
Cause they don't know you gotta make 'em understand us  
From the floor seats to the nosebleeds  
From the young ones to the og's  
From the Bob Loves to the Rozay's  
And from the mj's to the Joakim's  
See the statue outside, how this floor team  
Take a picture, this a city for the winners  
You ain't got horns, you gotta dress warm  
It really get chilly in the city in the winter  
Let's go  
  
[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls  
  
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]  
Fan from Day 1 or from back in the day - 91, 93, 96, 98  
And that white when we at home, that red when away  
Got my jersey, my Jordans, I'm ready to play  
I've been [?] representin' the city I was born in  
From the Go, so you know that we be going in  
Swear to God, I think we about to score again  
And we got that [?], we got that foul and we got that [?]  
They got that style but we got that [?]  
So we shut that down because we got that D fence  
Never let my city down, man I put that on Red Kerr  
Every dunk should make the cover of a magazine  
Feeling flyer than Benny on a trampoline  
  
[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls
