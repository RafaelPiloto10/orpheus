If I had to say what love feels like  
I'd say you  
If I had to say what love tastes like  
I'd say you  
If I had to show what love looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
If someone asked what heaven is  
I'd say you  
If I describe what pleasure is  
I'd say you  
If I had to show what a dream looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
In Webster's book  
I'd even add a word or two  
Under perfect lover  
I'd put see you  
  
If I had to show my biggest thrill  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
I'd say you  
I'd say you  
  
If I had to show what love looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you
