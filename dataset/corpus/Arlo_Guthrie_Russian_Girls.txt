Too many women growing up wrong  
Get an education, thinking thoughts on their own  
Making decisions, telling men what to do  
Look at the trouble that we're all going through  
Russian girls could save the world  
Here in America, land of the free  
Used to mean something to you and to me  
You can't tell women what they really are for  
Well, then you ain't really free anymore  
Russian girls could save the world  
Meanwhile back in the U.S.S.R.  
They're making women change tires on cars  
Working in factories and incredible as it seems  
They make them study gymnastics  
And you know what that means  
Russian girls could save the world
