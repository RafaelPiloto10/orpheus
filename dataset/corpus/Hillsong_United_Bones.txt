You can take my dry bones  
Breathe life into this skin  
You called me by name  
Raised me to life again  
  
You can calm the oceans  
Speak peace into my soul  
Take me as I am  
Awaken my heart to beat again  
  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Alive in me  
  
You move in the unseen  
You set the captives free  
As I stand and sing  
You're breaking the chains off me  
  
Breathe in me Your life  
I can feel You are close now  
I can never hide  
You are here and You know me  
All I need is You  
And I love You  
I love You  
I love You  
I love You  
  
Breathe in me Your life  
'Til Your love overtakes me  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see You more clearly  
Falling on my knees  
'Til I love like You love  
Like You love me  
I love You
