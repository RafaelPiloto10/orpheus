Locked behind the door  
Taken by force  
But I'm not guilty of the crime  
How can this be real  
What is aganst the law  
To say what's on your mind  
Then I see your face  
So warm as it comforts me  
And tells me I am not alone  
Pray for me tonight  
Give me the strength of love  
To help me cross the virgin snow  
I will run till daybreak  
My tears will fade away  
They'll never take me again  
No I'm never going back  
'cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely be so clear  
Can we give ourselves  
Like a mother to her child  
They took a part of me  
Whenever I think of it  
I shiver to the bone  
The scar is on my heart  
When will the crimes of  
Inhumanity be known  
I am only one voice  
I will not fade away  
So many are silent  
But I will never look back  
'cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely disappear  
The snow has gone at last  
I'm out of the shadows and into the sun  
And then I see you smile  
Angel of mercy  
The fight has jus begun  
I can hear them calling  
Across the frozen land  
The world will hear us  
You know it's never too late  
'cause when we get  
To the golden palace  
The memory will surely be so clear
