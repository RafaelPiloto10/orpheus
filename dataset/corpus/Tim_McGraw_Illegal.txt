I put my money down on love again  
At a hundred to one  
I don't mind losin' I'll just try 'til I win  
Or see how close I can come  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh it should be illegal  
It gets me so high  
I can fly like an eagle  
Night after night  
  
I know people who have thrown in the towel  
Just 'cause they've lost once or twice  
But it takes a believer to put all this faith  
In the toss of the dice  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Night after night after night...
