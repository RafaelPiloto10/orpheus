Tears come pourin' down my face,  
No one knows how I feel.  
I wanted to show you, all the fellings that are real.  
  
Don't look at me like that,  
Coz' I know I did nothin' to you.  
I'll show you all the things,  
That you've put me through.  
  
It is not a compliment,  
It is words from my heart.  
And that's how they will be.....  
Chorus:  
Everything is, just mine!  
Every part of my life is too,  
Every feelin' I feel,  
I can not lie!  
Coz' every time I try, I get put through hell.  
  
What do you think of me?  
And how do you feel bout' me?  
Why do you hate me,  
Coz' I know I did nothing to you.
