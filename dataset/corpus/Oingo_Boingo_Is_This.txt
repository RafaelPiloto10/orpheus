Another place, another time  
Another face that looks mine  
Another soul for all to see  
Is this reality?  
If I could only find the words  
I dream that they won't go unheard  
With one exception I can see  
Is this reality?  
  
Oh, if I could only make time stand still for a moment  
Capture a memory live it one more time, would I believe  
That I would really change a thing  
A second chance to get it right  
I think the end is close at hand  
I had a vision I don't understand  
Don't you see, I was made for you and you for me  
Close your eyes, are you ready for a big surprise  
  
Oh, hold the clock say the words to make it stop now  
Slam bam thank you maam  
Wasn't it a pleasant life we shared, who really cares  
Why pretend you don't remember  
Wipe it clean and start it again  
Hope to see you in the summer.  
  
Another place, another time  
Another face that looks like mine  
Another soul for all to see  
Is this?  
Is this?  
Is this?
