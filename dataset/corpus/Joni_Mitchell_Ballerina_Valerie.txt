Down in the garden  
Under a leaf, she was smoking her keef  
And she was looking at stardom  
Everything's bright as she draws on the pipe  
And the bowl glows redder  
And things look better  
  
Mars is a ruby  
Saturn is sapphire, it burns with a blue fire  
Colors run through me  
Loosen my thinking, they're flashing and blinking  
And always changing, rearranging  
  
Ballerina, Valerie now  
Move me through your crimson dances  
Terragan, a red bandana  
Bring me down your silver trances  
  
Down in the garden  
Under an oak, he was drinking his Coke  
And he was looking at stardom  
Everything's bright as he draws on the pipe  
And the bowl glows redder  
And things go better with Coca-Cola
