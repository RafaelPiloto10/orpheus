Girl, I can't believe my ears.  
Are you really telling my goodbye?  
See, you've taken away my reason for livin'  
And you won't even tell me why.  
Before you walk out the door  
There's something I want you to know.  
  
That I could never, ever love another, after loving you.  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share 'cause none could compare  
After loving you.  
  
It was only yesterday.  
Your words are still fresh in my mind.  
Baby, you said,  
Long as rivers flow  
Each day you'd love me more.  
Now you want to leave me behind.  
Listen baby, I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay.  
I just know I've got to find a way.  
  
'Cause I could never, never, never ever love another, after loving you.  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share 'cause none, none could compare  
After loving you.  
  
So baby, please stay beside me.  
I need your sweet love to guide me.  
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Oh, after loving you.  
  
(I could never love another, after loving you)  
  
Baby, baby, baby  
It was only, only, only, only yesterday.  
Your words are still fresh in my mind.  
I remember you said,  
Long as rivers flow.  
Each day you'd love me more.  
Now you want to leave, leave me behind.  
Listen baby, I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay.  
I just know I've got to find a way.  
  
'Cause I could never  
Never, never, never, ever love another, after loving you.  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share 'cause none, none could compare  
After loving you.  
  
Oh, baby.  
On my bended knees  
I'm begging you to stay here with me.  
Oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
I could never, never, never, never love another, after loving you.  
Oh ho  
No other love will I share 'cause none could compare  
After loving you.  
Baby, baby, baby, baby.  
(Never love another, after loving you)
