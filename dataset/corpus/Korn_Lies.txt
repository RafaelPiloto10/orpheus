I would like to search inside for all of the things that you will hide  
What's the problem?  
Can't you seem to set loose these problems that haunt and taunt you  
I smile, but you're afraid  
You run, while you're so in pain  
Do you ever see (it from) outside your fears?  
  
Thinking about your life  
Thinking about your inner fears  
I would like to search inside for all of the things that you will hide  
What's the problem?  
  
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you  
I want you to see the life you have disguised  
The world of things that hurt you  
For all these useless lies  
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside  
  
Once I'd took you in  
I'd throw you out instead  
I try, you win  
My life is ripping your heart out and distorting my pain!
