You have taken away all my pain  
You have taken away all my shame  
You have called me your own, and made me new  
Love has flooded my soul, and made me see  
You have taken control of all my sin  
You have given it all, and now I'm free  
  
For it's only by your grace  
We are saved, we are changed  
For it's only by your love  
We are free  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have risen from the grave  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have come to show the way  
And the world wont stop us moving forward  
Living for your name  
Hallelujah  
  
You have taken away all my pain  
You have taken away all my shame  
You have called me your own, and made me new  
  
For it's only by your grace  
We are saved, we are changed  
For it's only by your love  
We are free  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have risen from the grave  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have come to show the way  
And the world wont stop us moving forward  
Living for your name  
Hallelujah  
  
Your love is bigger than the galaxy  
Your love is deeper than the deepest sea  
Your love is why I'm here giving you praise  
[X4]  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have risen from the grave  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
You have come to show the way  
And the world wont stop us we're moving forward  
Living for your name  
Hallelujah
