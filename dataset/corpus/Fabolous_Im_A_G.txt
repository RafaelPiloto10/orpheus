[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I pull the chrome out with precaution  
Before things get blown out of proportion (chill)  
You know me I ain't grown out of the flossin'  
I'm still chromed out in the Porsche and  
Sick stones out in the cross and  
Before I known bout an endorsement  
I was pushin' stones out up in Boston  
Then the folks phoned out to enforcement  
Man gettin the case thrown I was exhausted  
So now I just lay back  
Maybach relax  
These niggas cant make what I pay back in tax  
Double Header hos they play back to back  
And this hip hop they spray back on tracks  
But me  
  
[Chrous: Fabolous]  
Look at me  
Everybody look at me  
I'm a G  
I'm a motherfuckin' G  
  
Look at me  
Everybody look at me  
Can't you see  
I'm a motherfuckin' G  
  
Look at me  
Everybody look at me  
I'm a G  
I'm a motherfuckin' G  
  
Look at me  
Everybody look at me  
Can't you see  
I'm a motherfuckin' G
