Pack up your bags  
Leave family society  
Oh come with me  
Where they treat you well  
At the door  
Old Lou the Jew  
Will welcome you  
In the corner lies the hotel  
At this refuge of mercy  
Head of the table  
King of laughter  
Percy  
And if you speak too much  
In company  
You'll soon be heard  
By that Mynah bird and whiskey  
At the top  
You'll find another brother  
Go ask my Mother  
She knows them all very well, hotel
