I don't care for this world anymore  
I just want to live my own fantasy  
Fate has brought us to these shores  
What was meant to be is now happening  
  
I've found that I like this living in danger  
Living on edge it makes feel as one  
Who cares now what's right or wrong,  
It's reality  
Killing so we survive  
Wherever we may roam  
Wherever we may hide  
We've got to get away  
  
I don't want existence to end  
We must prepare ourselves for the elements  
I just want to feel like we're strong  
We don't need a code of morality  
  
I like all the mixed emotion and anger  
It brings out the animal the power you can feel  
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin  
Excited but scary to believe what we've become  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something within us  
We are lord of flies  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something willing us  
To be lord of the flies
