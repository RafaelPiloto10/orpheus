What would you be if you weren't an animal?  
Who would you eat if you were a cannibal?  
Where do we go when our evolution is done?  
  
You're going home, you're tired of incident  
Kicked in the head by a nasty accident  
One with only half opposable thumbs  
  
Give me mine is what we're told  
When all we need's a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
It's only yours to borrow anyway  
  
What will you have when there's nothing left to take?  
Who will you hit when there's no one left to hate?  
Where will you go when you're going out on your own?  
  
We're all born in total ignorance  
Perfect as a happy accident  
Lose yourself, see how far you can go  
  
Give me silver, give me gold  
But all we need's a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
It's only yours to borrow anyway  
  
Give me mine is what we're told  
When all we need's a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
It's only yours to borrow anyway  
  
What would you be if you weren't an animal?  
Who would you eat if you were a cannibal?  
Where do we go when our evolution is done?
