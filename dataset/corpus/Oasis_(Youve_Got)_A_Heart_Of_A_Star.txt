Never gonna get along hanging out thinking out loud  
You never gonna get it on and be someone stuck in that crowd  
So you call out the feelings you hope that don't never exist  
But don't be ashamed of your bones and your blisters  
  
So come on come on my brothers and sisters  
'Cause you can only be what you are  
And you've got the heart of a star  
But the light never hits ya  
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters  
If you could see what I could see maybe we could all get along  
  
And maybe I could justify the bad things in life that I've done  
So I call out the feelings I know that don't ever exist  
I wont be ashamed of my bones and my blisters  
  
So come on come on my brothers and sisters.  
'Cause you can only be what you are  
'Cause you've got the heart the heart of a star  
But the light never hits ya.  
  
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters...  
  
And the slower that you go  
The greener the grass grows  
And what we all need is love in our lives.  
So go about your business  
'Cause life aint your mistress  
  
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters  
'Cause you can only be what you are  
'Cause you've got the heart of a star  
But the light never hits ya  
  
So be all you can  
And just hold up your hands  
Someday you'll understand why life never kissed ya  
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters  
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters  
  
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters  
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters  
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
