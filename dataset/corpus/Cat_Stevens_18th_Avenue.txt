Well I rode a while, for a mile or so  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And the people I saw were the people I know  
And they all came down to take a view  
Oh the path was dark and borderless  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And it stung my tongue to repeat the words  
That I used to use only yesterday  
Meanings just dropped to the ground  
I tried to remember what I thought  
And what I used to say  
"don't let me go down" no don't let me go  
Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside  
The empty waste of another day  
Memories were blank to my eyes  
The fire and the glory of that night  
Seemed safely locked away  
Too hungry to rise. Too hungry to  
  
Well I rode a while, for a mile or so  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And the people I saw were the people I know  
And they all came down to take a view  
Oh the path was dark and borderless  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
But my head felt better as I turned the car  
And the airport slowly came to view  
One mile said the sign  
Checked my bags and made it straight to end gate 22  
Made it just in time, boy you've made it just in time
