Lovely disguise, read between the lines  
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation  
Three, four you sell what you bought  
And there ain't no magic pen to get back what you lost  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Penguins don't fly  
Crocodile Sunday smile  
Really like to fish but don't like superficial people  
Shoe store heard it all before  
From pearly whites to pearly gates  
What do we have to argue 'bout  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Leave me all alone before  
(Get out the way)  
Never did what she was told  
(Get out the way)  
Seems to play at time of war  
(Get out the way)  
Less is big and listens more?
