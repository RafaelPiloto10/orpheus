You said I was northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
That's fighting talk where I'm from  
And I'm not moving baby  
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights  
It's alright, everything mellows in sunlight  
  
And now London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
I've been runny nearly all my life  
It left me broken baby  
When the meter ran out on life  
I used my tokens lady  
You said I was Northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
That's fighting talk where I'm from  
And I'm not moving baby  
  
London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
Saw one transmission  
On the television  
Saying I can't do my job  
Well I just kept dancing  
Don't hate me 'cause I'm handsome  
And the beat will never stop  
  
Saw one transmission
