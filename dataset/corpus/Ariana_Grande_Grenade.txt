Easy come, easy go that's just how you live  
Oh take take take it all but you never give  
Should've known you were trouble from the first kiss  
Has your eyes wide open why we're they open?  
  
Gave you all I had you tossed it in the trash  
You tossed it in the trash you did  
To give me all your love is all I ever had cause what  
You don't understand is  
I'd catch a grenade for ya  
Throw my hands on a blade for ya  
I'd jump in front of a train for ya  
Yu know I'd do anything for ya  
  
I would go through all this pain  
Take a bullet straight through my brain  
Yes I would die for ya baby  
But you won't do the same  
No, no, no, no  
Black black black and blue beat till I'm numb  
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where your from  
Mad bad boy that's just what you are yeah  
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car  
  
Gave you all I had you tossed it in the trash  
You tossed it in the trash yes you did  
To give me all your love is all I ever had  
Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya  
Throw my hands in a blade for ya  
I'd jump in front of a train for ya  
You know I'd do anything for ya  
I would go through all this pain  
Take a bullet straight through my brain  
Yes I would die for ya baby  
But you won't do the same  
  
If my body was on fire  
Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames  
You said you loved me you're a liar  
Cause you never ever ever did baby  
  
But darling I'd still catch a grenade for ya  
Throw my hands on a blade for ya  
I'd jump in front of a train for ya  
You know I'd do anything for ya  
I would go through all this pain  
Take a bullet straight through my Brain  
Yes I would die for ya baby  
But you won't do the same  
No you won't do the same  
You won't do the same  
Ooh you never do the same  
No no no no
