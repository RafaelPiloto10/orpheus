A well I bless my soul  
What's wrong with me?  
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree  
My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
  
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak  
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet  
Who do you thank when you have such luck?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
  
Please don't ask me what's on my mind  
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine  
When I'm near that girl that I love best  
My heart beats so it scares me to death  
  
She touched my hand what a chill I got  
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot  
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup  
  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!  
  
My tongue get tied when I try to speak  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree  
There's only one cure for this body of mine  
That's to have the girl that I love so fine
