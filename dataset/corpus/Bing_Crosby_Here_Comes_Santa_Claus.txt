Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  
Are pullin' on the reins  
  
Bells are ringin', children singin'  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings and say your prayers  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He's got a bag that is filled with toys  
For boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,  
What a beautiful sight  
  
So jump in bed and cover your head  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight, tonight  
Santa Claus comes tonight  
Happy days, happy times, listen to the bells and chimes  
As Santa Clause comes your way, today  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor  
For he loves you just the same  
  
Santa Claus knows we're God's chil'en  
That makes everything right  
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight, tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight, stand by  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He'll come around when the chimes ring out  
Then it's Christmas morn again  
  
Peace on earth will come to all  
If we just follow the light  
Lets give thanks to the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight  
Happy days, happy times, listen to the bells and chimes  
Here comes Santa Clause
