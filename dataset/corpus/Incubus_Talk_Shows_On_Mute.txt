Wash em out with buzzing lights  
Pay an au-  
Dience to care  
Impress me personality  
Still intransfixed  
  
The electric sheep are dreaming of your face  
Enjoy you from  
The chemical

Lights! camera! transaction!  
  
Quick your time

Make all forget that they're the moth  
Edging in  
Toward the flame burn into obscurity  
Still intransfixed  
The electric sheep are dreamin up your fate  
  
We judge you fom  
The card castle  
Comfort of america  
Come one come all  
Into 1984

Your foundation  
Is canyoning  
Fault lines should be worn with pride  
I hate to say it  
Your so much more  
Your so much more  
Endearing with  
The sound turned off
