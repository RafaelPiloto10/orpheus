Playing in the dirt  
We find the seeds of doubt  
Don't water them with your tears  
Don't think about all the years  
You'd rather be without  
  
Eden lets me in  
I find the seeds of love  
And climb upon the highwire  
I kiss and tell all my fears  
  
Falling down the mountain  
End up kissing dirt  
Look a little closer  
Sometimes it wouldn't hurt  
  
Playing in the dirt  
We find the seeds of fun  
And we scream like alleycats  
Tearing down what we attack  
To prove that we are one  
  
Cutting through the night  
And we find the seeds of lust  
And lose our minds on one intent  
These passions never seem to end
