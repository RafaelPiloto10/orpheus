Shyness is nice, and  
Shyness can stop you  
From doing all the things in life  
You'd like to  
  
Shyness is nice, and  
Shyness can stop you  
From doing all the things in life  
You'd like to  
  
So, if there's something you'd like to try  
If there's something you'd like to try  
Ask me - I won't say "no" - how could I?  
  
Coyness is nice, and  
Coyness can stop you  
From saying all the things in  
Life you'd like to  
  
So, if there's something you'd like to try

Spending warm summer days indoors  
Writing frightening verse  
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg  
  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
  
Because if it's not love  
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb  
That will bring us together  
  
Nature is a language - can't you read?  
Nature is a language - can't you read?  
  
So...ask me, ask me, ask me  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
  
Because if it's not love  
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb  
That will bring us together  
  
If it's not love  
Then it's the bomb  
Then it's the bomb  
That will bring us together  
  
So...ask me, ask me, ask me  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
Oh, la...
