Morning's here  
I feel so far away  
It seems like I felt this before  
All alone  
Sun burns my skin  
I can't live with pain anymore  
And with you on my mind  
Thinking of all that we've said  
Were they just words  
We'll live to regret  
Why won't you stay?  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again  
  
Times have changed  
Is love at an end?  
What makes us wonder why?  
Rearranged  
Just pretend  
I can't stand the thought of goodbyes  
And with you on my mind  
Thinking of all that we've said  
Were they just words  
We'll live to regret  
Why won't you stay?  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again
