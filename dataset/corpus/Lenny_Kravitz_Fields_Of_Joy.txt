Let's wander slowly through the fields  
Slowly slowly through the fields  
I touch the leaves that touch the sky  
Just you and I through fields of joy  
  
All trouble slowly fades away  
Slowly slowly fades away  
I hold your hand inside my hand  
Across the land through fields of joy  
  
The sound of music that we hear  
The blend of colors in the air  
All cities, mountains disappear from view  
All truth and beauty near to me and you  
  
With you through the fields  
With you through the fields  
With you through the fields  
The fields of joy  
  
Let's wander slowly through the fields  
Slowly slowly through the fields  
I know our love will never die  
Just you and I  
Through fields of joy  
Through fields of joy
