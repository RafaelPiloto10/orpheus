Day by day,night after night,  
Blinded by the neon lights.  
Hurry here, hustlin' there,  
No one's got the time to spare.  
Money's tight, nothin' free,  
Won't somebody come and rescue me?  
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire  
Stranded, caught in the crossfire.  
  
Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye.  
Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy.  
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime,  
Come on can't you see that I  
I am stranded ,caught in the crossfire  
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire.  
  
I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, no  
We're stranded, caught in the crossfire  
  
Save the strong lose the weak,  
Never turning the other cheek.  
Trust nobody don't be no fool,  
Whatever happened to the golden rule?  
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire  
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire  
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire  
Stranded, caught in the crossfire  
Help me.
