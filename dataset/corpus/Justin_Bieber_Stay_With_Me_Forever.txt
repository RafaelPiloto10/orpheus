[Verse 1]  
I said girl, what you wanna do with me?  
I could be your fantasy tonight  
I said girl, what you, what you wanna do?  
Yeah, cause it's just me and you tonight, tonight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Well people say it can't be real  
But love is in the air right now  
And you can tell I really care right now  
When I touch you like that, babe  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
We'll be fine, girl you know that we'll be fine  
You could never leave my mind  
Girl you know that we'll be fine  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said girl, we can take it to the floor  
Oh, I'll have you screaming more tonight  
I said girl, we could lay here watch a movie  
We could jump in a jacuzzi tonight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Well people say it can't be real  
But love is in the air right now  
And you can tell I really care right now  
When I touch you like that, babe  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
  
[Bridge]  
Well I ain't looking for a heartbreak  
Now it's a feeling that I can't shake  
No time for the heartache  
Too busy making out what it meant to me  
Du-oh-oh-oh  
No time for the mistakes  
Du-oh-oh-oh  
I just wanna say that....  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
Stay with me forever  
Lay with me forever  
As long as we're together  
We'll be fine, we'll be fine  
We'll be fine, girl you know that we'll be fine  
You could never leave my mind  
Girl you know that we'll be fine
