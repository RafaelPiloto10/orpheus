[Marius and Cosette lead a wedding procession.]  
  
Chorus  
Ring out the bells upon this day of days!  
May all the angels of the Lord above  
In jubilation sing their songs of praise!  
And crown this blessed time with peace and love.  
  
[The procession becomes a dancing celebration. A waltz is played.]  
  
Major Domo  
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their  
Respects to the groom!  
  
Thenardier  
I forget where we met  
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge  
Where the duke did that puke  
Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?  
  
Marius  
No, 'Baron de Thenard'  
The circles I move in are humbler by far.  
Go away, Thenardier!  
Do you think I don't know who you are?  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
He's not fooled, told you so.  
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show.  
Tell the boy what you know!  
  
[Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes.]  
  
Marius  
When I look at you, I remember Eponine  
She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth  
But now she is with God and happier, I hope  
Than here on earth!  
  
[The waltz starts up again.]  
  
Thenardier  
So it goes, heaven knows  
Life has dealt me some terrible blows.  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
You've got cash and a heart  
You could give us a bit of a start  
We can prove, plain as ink  
Your bride's father is not what you think.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a tale I could tell  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Information we're willing to sell.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a man that he slew  
I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!  
What I tell you is true!  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this  
But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss.  
  
Marius  
In God's name say what you have to say.  
  
Thenardier  
But first you pay!  
  
What I saw, clear as light  
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night  
Had this corpse on his back  
Hanging there like a great bloody sack.  
I was there, never fear  
Even found me this fine souvenir!  
  
[Thenardier shows Marius a ring.]  
  
Marius  
I know this! This was mine!  
Surely this is some heavenly sign!  
  
Thenardier  
One more thing, mark this well  
It was the night the barricades fell.  
  
Marius  
Then it's true, then I'm right  
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!  
  
[Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him.]  
  
As for you, take this too!  
God forgive the things that we do.  
  
Come my love, come Cosette  
This day's blessings are not over yet!  
  
[Marius and Cosette leave.]
