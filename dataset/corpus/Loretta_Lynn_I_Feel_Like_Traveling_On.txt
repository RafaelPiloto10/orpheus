My heavenly home is bright and fair I feel like traveling on  
No pain nor death can inner there I feel like traveling on  
Yes I feel like traveling on I feel like traveling on  
My heavenly home is bright and fair I feel like traveling on  
[ ac.guitar ]  
Its glittering towers the sun outshines I feel like traveling on  
That heavenly mansion shall be mine I feel like traveling on  
Yes I feel like traveling on...  
[ dobro ]  
The Lord has been so good to me I feel like traveling on  
Until that blessed home I see I feel like traveling on  
Yes I feel like traveling on...
