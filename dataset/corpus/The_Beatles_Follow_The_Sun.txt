One day, you'll look  
To see I've gone.  
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.  
Someday, you'll know  
I was the one.  
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.  
  
And now the time has come,  
And so, my love, I must go.  
And though I loose a friend,  
In the end you will know.  
  
One day, you'll find  
That I have gone.  
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.  
  
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.  
And now the time has come,  
And so, my love, I must go.  
And though I loose a friend,  
In the end you will know.  
  
One day, you'll find  
That I have gone.  
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
