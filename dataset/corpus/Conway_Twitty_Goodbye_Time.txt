Goodbye Time  
It's your life  
You say you need a change  
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true  
  
Mean anything  
You say it's different now  
And you keep staring at the door  
How can you walk away  
Don't I matter anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
If being free  
Is worth what you leave behind  
And if it's too late  
For love to change your mind  
Then it's goodbye time  
  
If we had known  
Our love would come to this  
We could have saved our hearts  
The hurt of wasted years  
  
Well it's been fun  
What else can I say  
If the feeling's gone  
Words won't stop you anyway  
  
[Chorus]
