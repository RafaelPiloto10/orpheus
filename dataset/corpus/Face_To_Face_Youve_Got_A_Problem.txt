so what's the problem this time?  
I thought you'd learn by now that nothing ever works out right  
you want to take away the edge  
you tell me it's the only thing that helps you forget  
you've made your promises  
that's not enough this time  
there's only so much you can squander from a feeble mind  
  
you've got a problem with your life  
you've got a problem with your mind  
  
don't try to tell me that you think it's going to work out fine  
so go ahead and try to hide  
the world around you watches on as you destroy you life  
do what your problem says  
there's not a lot of time  
there's only so much you can squander from a feeble mind  
  
you've got a problem with your life
