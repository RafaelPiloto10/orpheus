I haven't seen the things you've seen,  
I'm rushing to an empty goal,  
I lost control  
Every minute I remind myself,  
There's no way back unless I fall,  
I'm fighting my war  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No  
What's not I can not help tumble down  
But it's too late too soon or now  
I lost control  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down on the ground  
I wanna get out  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No  
And you push me up more and I wanna get down  
And you push me up more and I wanna resist  
And I push you on the floor but I don't wanna fight  
Can we please now stop  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No [2x]
