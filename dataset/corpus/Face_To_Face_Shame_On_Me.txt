it started out all wrong i wasn't thinking everything is wrong i couldn't see
it i guess i thought that things would somehow try and work themselves out i'd
like to think it's not so easy to convince myself that everything is going to
be ok shame on me this time i was only trying to make the best of this i
should have known fool me once then shame on you again and i must choose
between suspicion and naivete this is what you wanted anyway this time shame
on me i still believe i'm right even though i understand your side you have
your reasons
