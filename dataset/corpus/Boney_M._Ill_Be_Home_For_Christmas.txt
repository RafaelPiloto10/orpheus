I'll be home for Christmas  
I'll be home just in time  
I can't wait 'till I see you  
Feel your heart next to mine  
  
We'll be together again like before  
You and I all alone  
I'll hold you close when I walk through that door  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
We can stay by the fire  
With the lights turned down low  
We can watch happy children  
As they play in the snow  
  
Though I may be far away from you now  
Darling I promise this  
It wont be long 'till we're sharing a kiss  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
I'll be home Christmas time  
When you wait Christmas morning  
I'll be there by your side
