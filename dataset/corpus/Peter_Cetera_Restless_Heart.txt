I don't want to lose you  
I don't want you walking away  
We're so good together  
Tell me it's forever, 'cause I want you to stay  
I'll be damned if I'm living without you  
And as long as I live, you will know  
I just want to build my world around you  
Don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion baby  
Right from the start  
Cause the hardest part  
Is being alone  
With my restless heart  
  
Tell me where you want me  
Anytime I don't care  
Tell me when you need me  
Cause baby when you need me, I will be right there  
  
I don't want to build a wall around you  
Don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion baby  
Right from the start  
Cause the hardest part  
Is being alone  
With my restless heart  
  
I'll be damned if I'm living without you  
And as long as I live, you will know  
I just want to build my world around you  
I don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion right from the start  
Cause the hardest part is being alone  
With my restless heart
