I know you're someone's daughter  
You know I'm somebody's son  
We spent our lives until this moment  
Looking for the special one  
  
Nobody gave us the directions  
To this life we have to live  
Although we've both been taken  
We've got so much left to give  
  
So much left to give  
I know it's right behind me  
The blue highway that I've run  
It led me here to find you  
  
It's worth everything I've done  
To find my special one  
Now I've found my special one  
Now I've found my special one  
  
Maybe we won't find the answers  
Maybe life is just a song  
It may be imagination  
But the vision seems so strong  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I knew how it would be  
The world is full of wonder  
It takes both of us to see  
  
It takes both of us to see  
I know it's right behind me  
The blue highway that I've run  
It led me here to find you  
  
It's worth everything I've done  
To find my special one  
Now I've found my special one
