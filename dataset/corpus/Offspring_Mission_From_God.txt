Never knew where to go  
Never used to go to at night  
Thinking but I didn't know  
Never could seem to get it right  
But I've made up my mind  
Yeah I've made up my mind  
  
I wanna feel important  
I wanna feel alive  
Don't talk to me  
Don't talk to you  
You know I'm lying  
You know the truth  
  
Yeah, I'm on a Mission From God  
It sounds kinda crazy but I like it a lot  
I'm an answer to the man up above  
It's me he's speaking of  
Yeah, so I'm just a fortunate son?  
Everybody wants to be the chosen one  
I'm on a mission  
I'm on a mission from God  
  
I went to Pensacola just to get an opinion  
A perfect California get it straight in my mind  
Take a new road, take a new direction  
Maybe going to get it right  
But I've made up my mind  
Yeah I've made up my mind  
I wanna feel important

Don't talk to you  
You know I'm lying

Yeah, so I'm just a fortunate son?  
Everybody wants to be the chosen one  
I'm on a mission  
I'm on a mission from God  
  
If I could save the world  
I might do it  
I just might do it  
Now it's up to me  
So are you worth it?  
Are you really worth it?  
If I can save the world
