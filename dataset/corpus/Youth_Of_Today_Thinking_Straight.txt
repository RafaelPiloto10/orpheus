Life's filled with many paths  
Which one should I take ?  
When the choice comes, I won't run  
I'll be thinking straight !  
Life's filled with conflicts... we'll face  
We'll overcom them... thinking straight !  
Experiment with your mind  
You see things I can't see  
Well no thanks, friend  
Because now it ends when you push that shit on me!  
My mind is free to think and see.  
Strong enough to resist temptation  
We've been strong for all these years  
Yes, life gets rough, so we'll stand tough and confront  
All our fears!
