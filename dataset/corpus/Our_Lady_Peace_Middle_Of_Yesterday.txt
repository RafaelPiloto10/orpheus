Oh, well I woke up in hell today  
I woke up depressed and drained  
But that's OK 'cause I promised  
Not to hurt you again  
And apparently I'm to blame  
But apparently I've been framed  
By a memory that  
Won't help me when its happening  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out of the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
Until it will be okay  
Well, I promised you I would I change  
But I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed  
And I'm upset 'cause  
I betrayed everything that you gave  
Will you ever let me explain  
Can I beg you to let me stay  
Don't quit me 'cause ill never let this happen  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
Oh, I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
Oh, oh  
Oh, I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
Oh, oh
