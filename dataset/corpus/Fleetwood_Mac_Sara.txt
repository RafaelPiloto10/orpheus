Wait a minute baby  
Stay with me awhile  
Said you'd give me light  
But you never told me about the fire  
  
Drowning in the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now it's gone  
It doesn't matter what for  
When you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
And he was just like a great dark wing  
Within the wings of a storm  
I think I had met my match, he was singing  
And undoing, and undoing the laces  
Undoing the laces  
  
Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart  
Never change, never stop  
But now it's gone  
It doesn't matter what for  
But when you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
Hold on  
The night is coming and the starling flew for days  
I'd stay home at night, all the time  
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere  
Ask me and I'm there, yeah  
Ask me and I'm there, I care  
  
In the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now it's gone  
They say it doesn't matter anymore  
When you build your house  
Then please call me home  
  
Sara, you're the poet in my heart  
Never change, and don't you ever stop  
Now it's gone  
No it doesn't matter anymore  
When you build your house  
I'll come by  
  
Sara  
Sara
