[Chorus:]  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money  
He'll be coming back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
  
Ooh, house of love  
  
You've been up all night  
Thinking it was over  
He's been out of sight  
At least for the moment  
But when something this strong  
Ooh, Gets a hold on you  
The odds are ninety-nine to one  
It's got a hold on him too  
  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
  
Now when the house is dark  
And you're all alone inside  
You've gotta listen to your heart  
And put away your foolish pride  
Though the storm is breaking  
And thunder shakes the walls  
Love with a firm foundation  
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall  
  
Though the storm is breaking  
And thunder shakes the walls  
Love with a firm foundation  
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money  
He'll come back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming, lights are coming on  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money, baby  
He'll be coming back to you  
Back to you, back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
Ooh, yeah  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love
