I've been working a long long time  
Now I'm caught in a wicked bind  
You offered love but I threw that out  
I couldn't hear you I was too busy shouting  
  
Like a laughing hyena run out of breath  
I shot my rocks off 'til there's nothing left  
It's an old old story I suppose  
A heavy price for a heavy pose  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
Somebody should  
I'm pretty good  
  
International garbage man  
I've decided that's what I am  
I need somebody to pull me out  
I'm sinking like trazy in my sauerkraut  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
I've done my best  
Now you do the rest  
  
little boy take out your toys  
Lay them on the table  
Benwa balls and bugs that crawl  
I can't enjoy them without love  
Still I've been known to run around  
  
Take care of me  
But beware of me  
Sometimes I'm a snake  
Just aher the take  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
I've done my best  
Take care of me  
Now you do the rest  
Take care of me  
I'll never forget  
Take care of me
