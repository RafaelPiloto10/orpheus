I can see the world a'changing,  
I can see it re-arranging,  
Happening before my very eyes.  
  
Everywhere the cements growing,  
In the street the traffic's flowing,  
Ruining the air up in the skies,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
Near the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine and be free,  
Be free (Be free, be free)  
  
I can hear the cities calling,  
Come on down I can feel you falling,  
Happening for all of us to see.  
  
See the deepening cement hollow,  
Reaching out for those who follow,  
Hunkering on far too many lies,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
In the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine,  
And be free (be free, be free) and be free.  
  
From the winds so far away,  
I've had an inner vision,  
I've seen the universe unfold.  
  
[about 4 minute instrumental]  
  
I can hear the school bell ringing,  
From the yard the children singing,  
Merrily life is but a dream.  
  
In the street there go the brothers,  
Selling slow and ship to others,  
Aiding those who's songs have turned to cries,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
In the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine,  
And be free, and be free, and be free(be freee...)
