If you see Kay, you got to revel  
No angel wings more like the devil  
She was so hot, so cool and nasty  
Believe it or not here's what she asked me,  
If you need love with no condition  
Let's Do the Do honey I'm on a mission'  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'  
My soul's been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
If you see Kay, tell her I love her  
She did me in but I'll recover  
She said love was her desire  
All that she touched she set on fire  
She was so diss, I couldn't slay her  
She blew a kiss, I threw the dagger  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'  
My soul's been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
She came from the wrong side of town  
Every time she got off she gets knocked back down  
She's Heaven materialized  
She's givin' me Hell but it ain't no surprise  
She's a bit uncivilized
