[Chorus]  
Shitted on 'em,  
Man I just shitted on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Man I just shitted on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Put your number two's in the air if you did it on 'em  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em  
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em  
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em  
Let me shake it off  
I just signed a couple deals I might break you off  
And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator  
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This stone is flawless F-1  
I keep shooters up top in the F-1  
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one  
But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come  
Those some fresh one's  
More talent in my mother fuckin' left thumb  
She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb  
You ain't my son you my mother fuckin' step-son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix  
Bitch I get money so I do's what I pleases  
I live with the mother fuckin' pools and the trees is  
Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)  
Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty  
Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b  
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me  
I'm the terminator, bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her  
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator  
You my seed I spray you with the germinator  
Move back bugs, matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub  
If you could turn back time, Cher  
You used the be here but now you gone Nair  
  
[Chorus]
