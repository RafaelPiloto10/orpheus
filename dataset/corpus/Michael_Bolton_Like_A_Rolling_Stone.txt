Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?  
People called said, ?Beware doll, you're bound to fall?  
But you thought they were all just kidding you  
You used to laugh about everybody that was hanging out  
And now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging for your next meal  
How does it feel? How does it feel?  
To be on your own, with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone  
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns  
On the jugglers and the clowns when they did their tricks for you  
You never understood it ain't no good  
Shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you, oh  
You used to ride on a chrome horse with a diplomat  
Carried on his shoulder, siamese cat  
Ain't it hard when you discovered that he really wasn't where it's at  
After he took from you everything he could steal  
How does it feel? How does it feel?  
To be on your own, with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone  
Princess on the steeple, all the pretty people  
Drinking, thinking that they've got it made  
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things  
Better lift your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe  
You used to be so amused  
Napoleon in rags and the language that he used  
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse  
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to loose  
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal  
How does it feel? How does it feel?  
To be on your own and no direction home  
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone  
Just like a rolling stone  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
Just like a rolling stone  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
How does it feel?  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
Rolling stone  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
How does it feel?  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
How does it feel?  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
(Oh, how does it feel?)  
(Oh, how does it feel?)
