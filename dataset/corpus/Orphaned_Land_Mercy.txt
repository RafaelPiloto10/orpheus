[Limited Edition Bonus Acoustic Live CD. Paradise Lost cover]  
You live for times of solace  
Within a sign there's a promise,  
Don't lose all faith cause you shake at night  
It's in the art of the process.  
In another rhyme beyond this place.  
The healing's fast enough...  
Done a thousand times a thousand ways until  
You've had enough...  
It's mercy you're asking for cheating life  
By taking more it's mercy you're asking for  
Take my life or give me more...  
The loss of prize possession to cure the mind's obsession  
Could trade your soul for that normal life  
Elite to all objections...  
See beyond all tears and broken years your senses giving  
Up lose all confidence at your expense your courage swallows up
