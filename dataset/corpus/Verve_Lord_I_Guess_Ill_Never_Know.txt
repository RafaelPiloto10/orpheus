I heard you stirring in your sleep last night  
I was awake with something on my mind  
What happens when I leave, will you come with me?  
These things I guess I'll never know  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you touch when you come in your dreams?  
I know that sometimes I get lost  
Been asking questions since the day I could talk  
Life is sweet but when my bones get cold  
Will you be there for me to hold?  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you touch when you come in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, could it be yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You holding me  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know (repeat)  
When you die in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Will I be holding you?  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When I die in my sleep  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Will I be holding you?  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When you come in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Am I holding you  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When you come in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Am I holding you  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know
