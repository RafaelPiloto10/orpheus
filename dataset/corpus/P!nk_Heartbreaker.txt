I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye  
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?  
What about the way you say you love me all the time  
Are you liftin' me up to heaven just to drop me down the line?  
There's a ring around my finger, but will you change your mind?  
And you tell me that I'm beautiful but that could be lie  
Are you a heartbreaker  
Maybe you want me for the ride  
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leavin' here alive  
I wont be leavin' here alive, no  
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife  
Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side  
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now  
Watch it all play out see if you really stick around  
But there's always this one question that keeps me up at night  
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if I'm fallin' for
a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I'm holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh  
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride  
I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker  
This time around I wont survive cause if I've fallin' for a heartbreaker  
And everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I wont be leaving here alive
