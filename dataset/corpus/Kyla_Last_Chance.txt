This is my last dance with you  
This is my only chance to do all I can do  
To let you know that what I feel for you is real  
  
This is the last chance for us  
This is the moment that I just cannot let end  
Before I know that there's a chance we're more than friends  
  
So don't let go, don't let go  
Make it last all night  
This is my last chance to make you mine  
  
I kept my feelings so deep  
I kept my dreams of you and me somewhere inside  
Although I prayed that you would see it in my eyes  
  
But this is my last chance to say  
What's in my heart before you stay out of my life  
And then you'll understand the way I feel inside  
  
So hold me close cause it feels so right  
This is my last chance to make it mine  
Make this dream reality  
So close and yet so far  
Gotta find a way into your heart  
Gotta speak my mind  
Gotta open up to you this time  
I can't let you slip away tonight  
This is my last dance iwth you  
  
This is my only chance to do all I can do  
To let you know that what I feel for you is so real  
So don't let go  
Just make it last all night long  
This is my last chance to make you mine, yeah  
To make you mine
