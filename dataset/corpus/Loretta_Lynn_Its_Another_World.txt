It's another world when I'm with you  
Roses everywhere blue skies up above everybody is in love  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be  
Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with
you  
It's another world when I'm with you  
Nights are made for love days are never long nothing nothing can go wrong  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be  
[ steel ]  
Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with
you  
It's another world when I'm with you  
And it's here right now let me hold you close love you know just grows and
grows  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be
