All these posers keep you awake  
I guess I'm just too tired to sleep  
And God only knows I'm too lost to cry  
Kissing last has kept me true  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
Cause I'm so lonely  
  
He hates so much it's love he says  
Inside his dark I need to smile  
He shouts so loud I never hear  
That's why the truths always abused  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (another day another night)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (another day another night)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely
