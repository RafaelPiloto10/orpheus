The war is over if there was a war  
I hope we won  
A little boy waits with a lever on his own  
So I craft a ship to fly my way back home  
When the ocean of the sky swallows me whole  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
The hand, the slavemaster, what guessed his eye  
lie in pets  
Showed me just how closely men resemble pigs  
For the blind man that must journey into hell  
I was surprised to meet my mother there as well  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
I saw him flat so awkward up my hand  
Below the stars  
He Hopped in my bed we pretended to be friends  
But his sigh that could have torn this man apart  
And in his face I saw the canopy inferno  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
And I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home
