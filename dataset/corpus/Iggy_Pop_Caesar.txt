People of America  
I bring you a great army  
To preserve peace  
In our empire  
Throw them to the lions  
Darling, let us go to the banquet hall  
  
There will be a great feast tonight!  
Who are these Christians?  
What is this strange religion?  
I've heard it said they turn the other cheek  
Ha ha ha ha  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
Thumbs down  
  
10 pieces of gold for every man  
Hail Caesar hail Caesar  
Grapes from Sicily  
Silks from Asia minor  
All the tea in china  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
Who are these Christians?  
  
Turn the other cheek  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
Two thumbs down  
The Christians are restless  
Why not let them worship their god?  
  
No one believes in the old gods  
How tiresome, attending the rituals  
Paying lip service to the portents  
Burning incense at their shrine  
No one believes in the old gods  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
Throw them to the lions  
  
The roman empire the glory of Rome  
Hail all hail  
Caesar, Caesar, beware beware the ides of march  
Who is this man?  
  
Caesar, he is but a soothsayer, he is old  
And his brain is addled, pay him no mind!  
Throw him to the lions! ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Hail Caesar! emperor of Rome hail Caesar!  
Caesar, Caesar, beware the ides of march  
Eh?! who is this man?  
  
Caesar, he is but an old soothsayer, addled in his brain  
Pay him no mind  
Throw him to the lions! ha ha ha ha  
Throw him to the lions!  
No one believes in the old gods,  
The empire is tired, Caesar will rest now.  
  
We depart for my chambers  
Come darling  
"yes Caesar"  
Caesar will rest now  
Hail Rome hail Caesar hail  
Put him in the fiery pit  
Ha ha ha ha!
