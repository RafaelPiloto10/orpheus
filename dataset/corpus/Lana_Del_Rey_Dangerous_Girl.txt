He's my drugstore cowboy,  
Italian aloic,  
Classical american.  
  
And I'm america's sweetheart,  
Cute delicious, sweet tart,  
Sipping on my diet coke,  
Singin' in the trailor-park.  
  
He likes my jeans tight  
He likes me mean, right (right)  
He likes my long hair  
Corset, heels high.  
  
I'm born to kill,  
Strip for success,  
I'm his, sweet mess.  
Do you love me? Yes, yes!  
Hell, yes!  
  
Baby, I'm a forlorn fire,  
And I'm what you desire,  
Like a siren in the night (going neo neo)  
Baby is the man on the wire,  
Risking all that you've got,  
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)  
  
Let me play a dangerous girl,  
Let me be your dangerous girl.  
  
He's the get rich quick, type  
Mafia's hit tight  
Girl, I'm gonna marry yeah!  
  
I am the bad girl, next door.  
Babys always want more,  
Buyin' diamond jewelry,  
Take me to the jersey shore.  
  
He like my mink white (white)  
He go on all night,  
We're living off the grid  
Shining in the crime light.  
  
We were born to kill,  
Best of the best  
Nothing new, wild west  
Let me put on that party dress  
Hell, yes!  
  
Baby, I'm a forlorn fire,  
And I'm what you desire,  
Like a siren in the night (going neo neo)  
Baby is the man on the wire,  
Risking all that you've got,  
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)  
  
Let me play a dangerous girl,  
Let me be your dangerous girl.  
  
You love my baby plan, world domination  
Together taking over our fair nation.  
  
'Cause we're born to kill  
Keepin' it fresh.  
Gold chain, white mesh,  
Fame is the name of the game, yes yes!
