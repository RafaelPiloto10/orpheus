Got a call from the doctor  
He said hold on my friend  
You've gotta know what I'm knowing  
Please come right away  
He said Lucy's been seeing me  
And things just ain't right  
You'll have to hold things together  
'cause Lucy ain't much time  
Now should I tell her or keep it inside  
Making her happy by feeding her lines  
How am I gonna tell the children  
That Mama's goin' away  
I couldn't love another woman  
Oh Lucy please stay  
If I'm gonna lose you  
After all this time  
I'm gonna make life more beautiful  
I'm gonna make you make you feel fine  
If we make tomorrow  
We'll make it better every way  
We'll keep on building  
'cause we're living day to day  
chorus  
I couldn't love another woman  
Lucy please stay  
Baby baby  
Baby Lucy please oh won't you stay  
I need you I need you  
Please don't go please don't go  
Lucy please please won't you stay  
I want you to know that I love you  
I love you  
I'm gonna miss your sweet love  
Lucy won't you stay  
I need you, I need you.  
Please don't go, please don't go.  
Lucy, please, please, won't you stay?  
I want you to know that I love you.  
I love you.  
I'm gonna miss your sweet love.  
Lucy, won't you stay?
