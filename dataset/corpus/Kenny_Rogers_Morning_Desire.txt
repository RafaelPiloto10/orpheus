Here it is seven in the a.m.  
It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me  
I wake up with this need again  
But feel the love of the woman beside me  
It's just one of those days  
When I wanna lay here with her  
And love her before I leave  
And listen to the rain fall on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire  
It looks like I'm gonna be late again  
And I gonna give up and get movin' and I'm tryin'  
But the longer I keep stalling  
The more I think about callin' in and lying  
It's just one of those days  
When I wanna stay here with her  
And watch her while she sleeps  
And listen to the rain fall on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire  
Well, I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire, with morning desire  
Listen to the rain  
Listen to the rain  
Listen to the rain  
...
