If I had one single wish  
I'd go back to  
The moment  
I kissed you goodbye  
No mater how hard I try  
I can't live  
Without you in my life  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
I walk around  
Trying to understand  
Where we went wrong  
And I can't pretend  
It wasn't me  
And it wasn't you  
But I'm convinced  
We gave up too soon  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
Nothing left to lose  
After losing you  
There's nothing  
I can't take  
When I run to you  
When I come for you  
Don't tell me  
I'm too late  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go
