A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well  
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul  
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told  
So get a good hold, yeah  
  
Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are  
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far  
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know  
So let it all go!  
  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night, it feels so right!  
  
Night time sorrow, taken like a pain  
Black will not become a white, it's all the same  
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark  
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!  
  
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well  
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul  
So get a good hold, yeah  
  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night, it feels so right!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
If it feels right  
Turn off the light!  
Turn up the night!
