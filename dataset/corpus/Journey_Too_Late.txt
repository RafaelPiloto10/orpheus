See the stop-light turn-in' red,  
Don't you listen to what it's said.  
All the things you try to hide,  
They keep you runnin' hard inside.  
  
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
  
Ooo, yes, my friend, you're fadin' fast, if you stay here you won't last.  
Before your time has run astray, you've got to try to get away.  
Oh, you got to leave this place before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
Too late, too late to make the change  
Too late to make the change  
  
Yes, it's time to make the change, yes, it's time to rearrange,  
So, my friend, I join the fight for the things you know are right.  
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
Too late, too late to make the change  
Too late, too late, to make the change  
Too late to make the change  
Too late, before it's too late.
