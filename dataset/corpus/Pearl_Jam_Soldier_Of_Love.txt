Lay down your arms and surrender to me.  
Oh lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yeah.  
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so.  
Oh there ain't no reason for you to declare war on the one who loves you so.  
So forget the other boys because my love is real.  
Come off your battlefield.  
Lay down your arms and surrender to me.  
Yeah, lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yeah.  
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing 'cause that's the way it has to be.  
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad.  
But someday you're going to retreat.  
'Cause my love baby is the truest you've ever had.  
A soldier of love that's hard to beat.  
Lay down your arms and surrender to me.  
Lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yeah.  
Use your arms to hold me tight. Baby I don't wanna fight no more. (x2)  
Oh baby, lay down your arms. (x7)  
Please baby lay down your arms.
