You'll burn this time  
Seeing the violence  
It's feeding my mind  
No one is saving you  
How can you find  
A heaven in this hell?  
  
Leave it behind  
Hearing your silence  
It screams our goodbye  
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye  
Life is gone to waste  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace  
  
What have you done?  
Is this what you wanted?  
What have you become?  
His soul's not forsaken  
You're walking alone  
From heaven into hell  
Now that you know  
Your way in this madness  
Your powers are gone  
Your chains have been broken  
You've suffered so long  
You will never change.  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
He'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
He'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace
