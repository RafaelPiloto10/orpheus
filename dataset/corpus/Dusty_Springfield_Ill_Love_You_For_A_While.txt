Yeah, I will love you for a while  
Just how long I cannot say  
Long before love grows old  
I'll be on my way  
  
While there's fire in your eyes  
I will hold you to my heart  
Oh, but when the fire dies  
We will have to part  
  
Love is strange  
While now it makes us glad  
When our love's no longer new  
It'll make us sad, yeah  
  
So, I will love you for a while  
More than that I will not tell  
When I leave you  
You will say that I loved too well  
  
Yeah, love is strange  
While now it makes us glad  
When our love's no longer new  
It'll make us sad, yeah  
  
So, I will love you for a while  
More than that I will not tell  
And when I leave you  
You will say that I loved too well  
Say that I loved too well, boy  
Say that I loved too well, yeah  
Say that I loved too well-ell  
Say that I loved too well, child  
Say that I loved too well
