Never, never will I marry  
Never, never will I wed  
Born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed, never  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
No conscious, no care, no burdens to bear  
No memories to mourn, no turning  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never, never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
Never, never
