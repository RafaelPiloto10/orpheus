Her bones will ache, her mouth will shake  
And as the passion dies her magic heart will break  
She'll fly to France, but there's no chance  
No hope for Cinderella  
  
Come September  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
Her violet sky, will need to cry  
And if it doesn't rain then everything will die  
She needs to heal, she needs to feel  
Something more than tender  
  
Come September  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
The souls that burn will twist and turn  
And find you in the dark no matter where you run  
she's made her mark but lost her spark  
And what she's looking for she can't remember  
  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
Her eyes surrender her cries  
A crying shame  
Comin' undone is she aver gonna feel tha same  
  
She will run, she's gonna drink the sun  
Shining there for you instead of everyone  
And so it goes she'll stand alone  
And try not to remember  
Come September  
  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September
