Look upstanding with your head held high  
You will be reflected  
You look outstanding with your eyes in disguise  
Just beyond your masks  
  
Holy, Hollywood (he), it's divine  
I'm surely glad, I'm surely all the time  
And even though I'm, you will always hear  
  
Very rarely worry utmost constantly  
Could you be receptive  
Our life's outstanding in a shower please  
Wet my skids a plenty  
  
Baby, what a day all over town  
I'm surely glad, I'm surely all around  
And even since I knew, it's all so clear  
  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected  
You will be reflected, reflected  
  
Yeah
