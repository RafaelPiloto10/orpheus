Maybe I went too far this time I just go crazy when she says no  
Angel turns away pulls her dress back down slowly washes her face  
Takes the bus to her job downtown  
  
She said, "I'm OK don't worry about me"  
Now she thinks for herself, "Hey what happened to me?"  
  
I told him that I thought it was over told him that I wanted to leave  
He used to touch me so nice when we first met  
I never dreamed he would hit me I never dreamed he would hold me down  
  
She said, "Don't worry about me I won't worry about you"  
"I don't want to be friends", she said, "I'm OK"  
Just leave me alone, just leave me alone  
She said, "Don't worry about me I won't worry about you"  
She said, "I'm ok don't worry about me"  
  
I don't want to be friends  
Just leave me alone, just leave me alone  
Don't worry about me, don't worry about me
