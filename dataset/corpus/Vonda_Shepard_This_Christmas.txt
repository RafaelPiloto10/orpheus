Hang all the mistletoe  
I'm gonna get to know you better  
This Christmas  
And as we trim the tree  
How much fun it's gonna be together  
This Christmas  
  
The fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
