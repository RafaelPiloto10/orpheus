Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress  
Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose  
Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that it's better to confess  
Which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose  
  
[Chorus]  
Every step might be your last  
Money signs are in your eyes sucker  
You've been taken in this time  
You might just get out alive if you're lucky  
All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch  
Are looking in on you  
And they're hungry  
  
He stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat  
He was known by several different names  
Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions  
And then after that he said I'm sick and tired of stupid games  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've got prizes if you can afford  
Some small humiliation before you get your reward  
And I'd rather be an outlaw than an in-law to you  
And to live my life in miserable poverty  
Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel  
So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery  
  
As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks  
He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money  
As they do their victory dance  
He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks  
They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel
