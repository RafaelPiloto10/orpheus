Preach the Gospel to all the world,  
And if necessary, use words. St. Francis of Assisi  
  
We're passengers aboard the train  
Silent little lambs amidst the pain  
That's no longer good enough  
And when it's time to speak our faith  
We use a language no one can explain  
That's no longer good enough  
  
And God knows it's a shame  
As we look to pass the flame  
We are not the worthy bearers of his name  
  
[Chorus]  
For the world to know the truth  
There can be no greater proof  
Than to live the life, live the life  
There's no love that's quite as pure  
There's no pain we can't endure  
If we live the life, live the life  
Be a light for all to see  
For every act of love will set you free  
  
There's something beautiful and bold  
The power of a million human souls  
Come together as one  
And each in turn goes out to lead  
Another by his word, his love, his deed  
Now the circle is done  
  
It all comes back to One  
For it is He and He alone  
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known  
  
[Chorus]
