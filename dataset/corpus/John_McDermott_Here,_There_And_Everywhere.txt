Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with a wave of her hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
There running my hands through her hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there  
  
I want here everywhere  
And if she's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there and everywhere  
Here there and everywhere  
I will be there and everywhere  
Here there and everywhere
