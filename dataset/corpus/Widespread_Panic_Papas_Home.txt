Papa's hitting the road again  
Takes the show cross-country for hire  
And the crowds come and go  
Secret agents getting bigger  
Mom's holding sister in the chair  
Turning pages of photographs  
Warm in their memories  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
To the highway where some new cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
And the crew's still working  
Everybody's cracking jokes  
Morning comes so easy  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Take the rest in the look in her eyes  
As they go and close time  
  
Papa's driving past the night  
He's working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come, when the morning comes  
  
To the highway where some old cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
Some drink here, some dance here  
Hear old big boy telling jokes  
Mom's holding sister in the chair  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Warm in their memories of  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
Papa's he driving past the night  
He's working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come, when the morning comes  
Papa's coming home  
Papa's coming home  
  
Papa coming home
