Here is my hand for you to hold.  
Here's a part of me they have not sold.  
I've wandered far, I've had my fill.  
I need you now, do you love me still?  
  
Only you have seen the hidden part of me  
Call me fool hearted if you will.  
I loved you then, do you love me still?  
  
So many smiles and lies surround me.  
Empty expectations, faceless fears.  
Sometimes this life is a bitter pill.  
I love you now, do you love me still?  
  
You have been mine since time untold.  
Our love is immortal, don't you know?  
Others will come and they will go.  
But I love you young and I love you old.  
  
Only you have seen the other side of me.  
Call me naive, I think you will.  
I loved you then, do you love me still?  
  
Here are the eyes that only see you.  
Here's the mouth that only calls your name.  
Here is the song they cannot kill.  
I love you now, do you love me still?
