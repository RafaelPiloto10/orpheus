Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,  
Didn't you?  
  
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're  
Bound to fall"  
You thought they were all kiddin' you  
  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hangin' out  
Now you don't walk so proud  
Now you don't talk so loud  
About having to be scrounging for your  
Next meal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
A complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?  
  
You've went to the finest school all right,  
Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used to get juiced  
In it  
Nobody has ever taught you how to  
Live on the street  
But now you find out you're gonna have  
To get used to it  
You said you'd never compromise  
With the mystery tramp, but now you  
Realize  
That he's not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And say do you want to make a deal?  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
A complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?  
  
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty  
People  
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it  
Made  
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and  
Things  
You'd better take your diamond ring,  
You'd better pawn it babe  
You used to be so amused  
At Napoleon in rags with the language that  
He used  
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't  
Refuse  
When you got nothing, you got nothing to  
Lose  
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to  
Conceal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?
