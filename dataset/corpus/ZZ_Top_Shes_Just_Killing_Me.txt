Also released on the From Dusk Till Dawn soundtrack.  
  
Everything about her was natural  
Everything about her was cool  
But I'm a little partial for beautiful girls  
Even if they blood runs blue  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
I think I love her  
She's just killing me  
I think she's killing me  
  
Her castanets are enormous  
Her bongo beat absolute  
And when she doin' midnite performances  
She's got a secret somethin' to boot  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Oh, I think I love her  
But she's just killing me  
I think she's killing me  
  
Miss Satanic Pandemonia  
Don't get any lower or slower  
What you see is what you get conmigo  
And the bonus of an albino boa  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Yes, I think I love her  
She's just killing me  
She's just killing me  
(That's some time I had)  
  
I think I see her  
I know I love her  
Yes, I might love her  
She's just killing me  
She want to be killing me  
(Suck my blood)
