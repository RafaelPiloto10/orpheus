Looking from a window above  
It's like a story of love  
Can you hear me?  
Came back only yesterday  
Moving farther away  
Want you near me!  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of your name  
And it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listen to the words that you say  
It's getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
I can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
I can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you
