Some girls are so fine, sister sister  
Don't wanna change your mind but  
Some girls run home so optimistic  
About the love in their lives  
  
See the girls on parade  
In high-fashion magazines  
And like some x-rated movie  
Oh, that fashion on the screen  
Enough for everyone to see  
I know that she's not ever going back again  
  
Well some girls you meet and  
Then you kissed her and she taste so sweet  
This girl, you find out, looks like her sister  
Yeah she's been coming around  
I see her backfield's in motion  
She puts me under her spell  
She's got some weird magic potion  
Some concrete cloud over you  
And I know it's burnin' hell  
I know that she's not ever going back again  
You see one, she's coming with her new-found friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And she's not ever going back again  
You see one, she's coming with her new-found friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Oh bye, bye, bye, bye baby bye bye  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
Bye, bye, bye, bye baby bye bye  
I love you like I own you, baby
