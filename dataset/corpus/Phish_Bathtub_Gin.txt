Brett is in the bathtub  
Making soup for the ambassadors  
And I am in the hallway  
Singing to the troubadours  
  
The kings are all lined up  
Outside the gate  
And the autumn bells are ringing  
But they'll just have to wait  
  
Where is the joker?  
Have you seen him around  
With his three coned cap  
That he wears like a clown?  
  
Have you seen his stripped stockings  
And heard his sad tale  
About the kids under the carpet  
And the purple humpbacked whales  
  
Here come the ambassadors  
They show up one by one  
Brett is tasting all the soup  
To see if it is done  
  
Wendy's on the windowsill  
Waiting to be let in  
And we're all in the bathtub now  
Making bathtub gin  
  
The kings storm the hallway  
They've climbed up through the gate  
They didn't mean to be impolite  
But they just couldn't wait  
  
Here comes the joker  
With his silly grin  
He carries a martini  
Made of bathtub gin  
  
Here comes the joker  
We all must laugh  
Cause we're all in this together  
And we love to take a bath.
