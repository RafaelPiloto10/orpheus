Im mac maine and this young money you betta em  
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum  
Done what i shouldn't did but they said i couldnt  
Hid where all the killas hid at  
Im where the other hustlas slung at waitin on that get back  
Get that flip that debatin on that mix match  
Switch that from dope ta coke  
Im goin up fast now you niggas is slowin fast  
Now my is niggas blowin abs  
If i tell em you niggas is hoein up cash  
Rollin up steppin out of the phantom ass put yo lighters away you talkin to a
can of gas  
There's nothin ta no matter who comes ta ask  
And murder aint funny but we do love ta laugh  
We just livin take money take baths  
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her and send her back with nothin  
Now isn't that disgustin give him back his sister give him back his cousin  
Yeah go make a stack or something go and buy yourself a spine and get her back
ta frontin  
Yeah and ta end that discussin i been had strenght i just got the muscule  
Fuck you it's that or the other i see my people strugglin wish that they
wasn't  
The government try ta put us in the muzzle but yo two fingers aint the pieces
ta the puzzle  
Shit so to each it's yo own hustla and i hustla all night the go home ta the
fustin  
Then wake up ta the fuckin breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin  
Hawiian punch taste like robitussin a nigga just livin just breathin just
puffin  
Cmon momma drop that la burner dick milimeter cock back murder  
Banks in the hater we can not go any further  
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will murk us  
Pussy niggas talkin all that smack we will murk his  
Hungry ass niggas i tote two hamburgers  
Who what beef who what beef  
I bring to front door and now you seem nervous  
Two seater sweve traffic ta hell with it shit you can't die with cant  
Shit you can't die with it can't go ta jail with it  
Might as well lay in it pass and then fail with it  
Me i exhale then tell and tell whip with it  
Give them niggas something ta them bitches smelling like money after full
court scrimmage  
The fam at the table got a full course dinner  
Young money cash money throw pifatti at the winner  
And yet he understund us when we told him break it off  
Cause gangstas talk one word will be a wall  
Alone with two can't handle this destructin  
All body killin baby sound like seductin  
Niggas change dough bitches follow the instructions  
Sometimes you goota out the whole rooster in the oven  
So tell the public ima do my thing  
Just as soon as i hear that bing  
I got comin comin up  
You niggas just runner ups  
And runnin up will get you in that wheelchair forever  
Its whatever ima be here forever  
Cause the little nigga better than all you niggas together  
Im gone
