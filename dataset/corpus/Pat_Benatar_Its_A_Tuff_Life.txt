Isn't it a tuff life?  
You race your Mercedes through the park after midnight  
Hopin' for a few cheap thrills  
There's always someone around to lift your spirits up  
All along just pumpin' up your attitude  
Don't believe a word they say  
Cause it's never true  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
If you can't have it, then you don't want it  
You don't need no steady job  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
  
You thought you'd move to Jamaica  
So you packed up your bags and headed south to get an even tan  
But, you didn't count on rain  
  
You were "perfect" for the script  
So you bought the best selling novel  
Knowing that you couldn't miss  
But you never got the part  
  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
If you can't have it, then you don't want it  
You don't need no steady job  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
  
It don't get any easier  
And you know, sometimes it can get pretty ruff  
  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You've got such a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got such a tuff life)
