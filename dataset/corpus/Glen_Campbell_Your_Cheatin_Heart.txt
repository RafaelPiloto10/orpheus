(Your cheatin' heart will make you weep)  
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry you'll try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheatin' heart will tell on
you  
When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name  
And you'll walk the floor the way I do your cheatin' heart will tell on you  
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday and you'll crave the love you threw away  
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheatin' heart will tell on you  
When tears come down...
