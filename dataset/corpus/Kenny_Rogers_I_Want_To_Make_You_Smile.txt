I want to make you smile  
When I run too fast, slow me down  
When I run to far, turn me around  
Sometimes life becomes an endless waste  
Sometimes love can't stand the lonely pace.  
Each day goes by much too fast  
Tomorrow soon becomes the past  
Lost in struggle I'm making my way  
Not taking time enough to simply say:  
I love you, forgive me  
I know it's been a while  
I love you, I wanna stop the world  
And make you smile.  
Too many days I forgot to take your time  
To say I love you and thank you for being mine  
Those simple words I sometimes forget to say  
We'll be on my lips at the wake of each new day.  
I love you ...  
But you know I love you  
I wanna stop the world and make you smile  
If it's not too late to make you smile.
