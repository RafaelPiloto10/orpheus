Mmm, mmm, ohh, no, oh, no  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy  
I'm addicted to you  
Gotta have it for all the things that you do

Amazing, mistakes all night and day  
Makes my temperature rise  
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized  
I'm feeling something that I can't understand  
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand  
Its survive, it's your style, it's the way that you smile  
Get a little rush when I hear your name  
It's so magnetic when you're here next to me  
Hold me closer, happens so naturally  
We connect, it's electric, this feeling inside  
Didn't know that even if I tried  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy

Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

You got me spinning like a marry-go-round  
Feels like I'm flying but I ain't left the ground  
Falling fast, I'm afraid, can't escape there's no way
