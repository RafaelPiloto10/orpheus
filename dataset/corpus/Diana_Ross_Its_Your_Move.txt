I don't understand it 'cause you won't say yes  
But you don't say no  
Sayin' no shouldn't you keep holdin' out  
But you don't let go  
I'm givin' up on trying  
To sell you things that you ain't buying  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
You're giving me the business with that old come on  
But you don't come across  
You get me so excited don't you know you're such a tease  
When I think you're gettin' hot, you're not  
So what's the problem, what's wrong  
This kiss and miss you know it can't go on  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
I'm givin' up on trying now it's  
Girl, if you ain't buyin' now it's  
I gave it all I got now it's  
I thought you were hot but you're not so it's  
Your move, your move your move  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move
