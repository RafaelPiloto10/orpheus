She came to the coast from the show me state  
With her daddy's blue eyes and her mama's blind hate  
Guess she didn't know much but she knew the rules  
What she needed to learn, she would find in L. A.  
Not back in that school  
Didn't wanna read about it  
Guess she wanted to see  
Carolea, she's carolea  
Yeah, yeah, never quite sure what she wanted to be  
Just a little girl alone in a big bad place  
With a devious mind and a beautiful face  
Ever since she was a baby she learned how to play  
Wanted money in her hands from the easiest way  
All her friends said, stop girl, you can't pay the price  
But the hard way out don't appeal to the beast inside  
She don't wanna hear about the better life  
Guess she's ready to be  
Hey, carolea  
  
She never tells the truth to the folks back east  
Truth about the drugs and the men she gets paid to please  
Well they don't know  
Yeah, they don't see  
Yeah, that finally now after all these years  
She's let the beast inside roam free  
Carolea
