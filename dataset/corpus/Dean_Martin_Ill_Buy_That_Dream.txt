Imagine me with my head on your shoulder  
And you with your lips getting bolder  
A sky full of moon and a sweet, mellow tune  
I'll buy that dream  
Imagine you in a gown white and flowery  
And you thanking Dad for your dowry  
A church full of folks and those last minute jokes  
I'll buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo, with a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little low crazy palace  
Oh, it's not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It doesn't sound bad, and if it can be had  
I'll buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo, in a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little coo-coo palace  
It's not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It don't sound bad, and if it can be had  
I'll buy that dream
