Where did all these smart girls come from?  
I don't think that I could choose just one  
Where did all these smart girls come from?  
Someone tell me how to get me some  
  
On the floor, in the car  
On the seat at the bar  
Wherever I go  
That's where they are  
  
Smart girls  
Never get enough, of those  
Smart girls  
Smart girls  
  
I want to be a bad boy right now  
The real me is dying to hang out  
I know you know what I'm talking about  
I've got a feeling you could show me how  
  
On a bus, on a train  
On a boat, on a plane  
I'm falling in love  
What was your name?  
  
Smart girls  
Never get enough, of those  
Smart girls  
Sleeping in the buff  
  
Yumi, Sherie, Alison, Mary  
Which one do I want to marry?  
They're all smart girls  
They're all smart girls  
Sheena, Lola, Fabiola,  
Don't you know you make me lose my mind?  
  
Where did all these smart girls come from?  
I don't think that I could choose just one  
Where did all these smart girls come from?  
Someone tell me how to get me some  
  
Lisa, Brittany, Paula, Whitney  
Which one do I want here with me?  
They're all smart girls  
They're all smart girls  
  
Debbie, Donna, Tatiana  
Don't you know you make me lose my mind?  
  
Smart girls  
Never get enough, of those  
Smart girls  
Skipping in the buff  
  
Smart girls  
Talkin' 'bout smart girls  
All I want is smart girls  
Talkin' 'bout smart girls
