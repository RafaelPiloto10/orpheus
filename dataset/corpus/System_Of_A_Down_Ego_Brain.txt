I am just a fool  
Searching for a stool  
A stool  
Trying to look real cool  
Now I'm just a man  
Fighting other men  
For land  
For land  
While I turn to sand  
While I turn to sand  
  
Life is but a dream  
Drifting on a stream  
A stream  
Consciously it seems  
All of what remains  
Despite our ego brain  
Love after it rains  
Ego brain  
Love after it rains  
  
You see my pain is real  
Watch my world dissolve  
And pretend that none of us see the Fall  
As I turn to sand  
You took me by the hand  
And declared  
That love prevails over all  
  
All of what remains  
Despite our ego brain  
Love after it rains  
Ego brain  
Love after it rains  
  
You see my pain is real  
Watch my world dissolve  
And pretend that none of us see the Fall  
As I turn to sand  
You took me by the hand  
And declared  
That love prevails over all  
Love after it rains  
  
Life is but a dream  
Drifting on a stream  
a stream  
Consciously it seems  
All of what remains  
Despite our ego brain  
Love after it rains  
Ego brain  
Love after it rains  
  
You see my pain is real  
Watch my world dissolve  
And pretend that none of us see the Fall  
As I turn to sand  
You took me by the hand  
And declared  
That love prevails over all  
  
I am just a man  
Fighting other men  
For land  
For land  
While I turn to sand  
In spite of the pain  
Ego Brain  
Turns to Shame  
Shame  
Love after it rains  
  
You see my pain is real  
Watch my world dissolve  
And pretend that none of us see the Fall  
As I turn to sand  
You took me by the hand  
And declared  
That love prevails over all  
  
All of what remains  
Ego Brain  
Turns to Shame  
Shame  
Love after it rains  
  
You see my pain is real  
Watch my world dissolve  
And pretend that none of us see the Fall  
As I turn to sand  
You took me by the hand  
And declared  
That love prevails over all
