All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean, with my will  
Something's tellin' me in my eyes  
You're not living, you're dying  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Is chop wood for my fire, for winter  
But all you ever picked up as young  
Is get a job and you'll go higher  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry  
  
All I ever had to do  
Was with living or dying, in this world  
All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean  
With my will  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry
