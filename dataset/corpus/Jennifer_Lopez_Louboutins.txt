Taking back my love (7X)  
  
You said you'd change  
But still nothin'  
You're still the same  
I'm just a part-time lover  
And I'm the blame  
Shoulda went away  
But yet I stayed...  
With a part-time lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't,  
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone.  
Now you got me stressin' out on the phone  
But it's the last time  
I'm moving on  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9X)  
  
I left the state  
And changed everything  
No more 818  
For the part-time lover  
What goes around  
Comes back around  
And then you get what you deserve  
You part-time lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't,  
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone.  
Now you got me stressin out on the phone  
But it's the last time  
I'm moving on  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9X)  
  
Watch these red bottoms  
And the back of my jeans  
Watch me go by babe  
  
You don't know what you got until it's gone  
Tail lights is all you'll see  
Watch that Benz exit that driveway  
  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9x)  
  
Watch me walk it out  
Walk it out (2X)  
Walk this right up out the house  
Walk it out  
Boy, watch me walk it out  
Walk it out  
Walk this right up out the house  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (out the house) (8X)
