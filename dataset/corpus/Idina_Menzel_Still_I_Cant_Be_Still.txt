Well I don't believe in god  
But she talks to me all the time  
And I banish my mother  
But she holds me when I cry  
And I have been unfaithful for  
With me he'll spend the rest of his life  
  
Yet I have been forgiven  
By all whom I've betrayed and loved  
And I have everything I want  
Is it ever enough?  
  
Chorus: Still I can't be still  
Still I can't be silent  
Still I can't be still  
Still I can't be saved  
Still I can't be still  
I can't be silent  
Still I  
Still  
  
Well I don't believe I'm beautiful but  
At least I have my sister's smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me in exile  
And destiny is not deafening  
But it hushed me like a child  
And every time I feel as though  
I'm closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived-  
  
Chorus  
  
The insatiable peace  
Of my quest for, for true serenity  
No matter how hard the rain  
The thirst, the thirst is never ending  
No matter how many friends  
For angels been sent down to take me away  
They can't make it okay  
  
And every time I feel as though I'm  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived  
Yes every time I feel as though I'm  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived  
I don't believe I'm beautiful  
But least I've got my sister's smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me  
Still  
Destiny is deafening
