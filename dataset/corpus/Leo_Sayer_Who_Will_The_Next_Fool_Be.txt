Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling  
Falling so deep in love with you  
But you say that  
Only a fool could fall in love  
With a girl like you  
If that's the truth  
What have I got to lose?  
And I wonder who, I wonder who  
  
Who will the next fool be  
Will it be me?  
I wonder who  
Can you tell me please  
Who will the next fool be  
Could it be me?  
  
Lonely, I'm so lonely  
Maybe, maybe you're lonely to  
So don't spend your time  
Just sitting around  
Wondering who will he be  
  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me  
I'm the one you need  
Can you tell me please?  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me, I don't mind  
  
Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling  
Falling, what can I do  
Thinking a girl like you  
Could fall for a fool like me  
  
Who will the next fool be  
Could it be me?  
  
Can you tell me please  
When you make up your mind  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me
