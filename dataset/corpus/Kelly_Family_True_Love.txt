People talking about true love all around  
But I've never seen it I must be too young  
You learn and you burn and that is the game  
That famous game  
They call falling in love  
Don't give, don't give any hope it was not supposed to be  
  
I've learned and I've burnt and now I'm happy  
I have my own family with a smile on our face  
Hold on cause all I want is that smile on my child  
Give me give me all your love it was meant to be  
  
Our love is strong  
Our love is strong  
  
When it gets hard cause life ain't easy  
Running is easy, staying is hard  
Hold on cause all I want it that smile in my child  
Give me, give me all your love it was meant to be  
  
Our love is strong just hold on to me  
Our love is strong just hold on to me  
Our love is strong it is strong, yes, it is.
