Hello, girl  
You're good to see  
Love your face shinin' down on me  
How's it feel with the warm winds blowin'  
  
Hello, girl  
You're good to know.  
Love your smile, I love your glow  
How's it feel with the warm winds blowin'  
  
CHORUS:  
Must have touched the right part of me  
The sun in your eyes  
You came running in from the start  
Connected all the right numbers  
In the picture you were painting of me  
  
Listen girl  
I can't let go  
The time is right, I have to know  
What's it like, when the fire is burning  
  
CHORUS  
  
SOLO  
  
CHORUS (2 times)
