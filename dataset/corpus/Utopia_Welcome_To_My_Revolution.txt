There's too much music, too much light  
These endless broadcasts into the night  
Petty seizures of money and drugs  
By some official or unauthorized thugs  
Now it's gone, the whole world's gone  
There's the army at the front door, guerrillas in back  
Why do I always have to take up sides  
I had no plans to be conscripted today  
I am no use to them anyway  
So what the hell's going on  
When they took my bed for the good of the state  
I had to rest my head and took to levitation  
Welcome to my revolution  
Every morning they confer with the press  
Just to point a few fingers  
Fix the blame for this mess  
The spokesmen waffle and the jerk-offs complain  
In a stream of rhetoric  
Piss themselves down the drain  
Then it's time to go home  
Time to go home  
What will they say when it's gone  
The whole world's gone  
So they call a cease fire to bury the dead  
And just delay it for an hour or so  
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied  
What does it matter once we're vaporized  
Say what the hell's going on  
Then it got so bad I couldn't breathe the air  
So I became my own church and begged for sanctuary  
Welcome to my revolution  
This is the dream that I have every night  
I wake up screaming t  
Is this my vision of the end of the world  
The faces looked smoldered, the edges are curled  
Tell me what is the reason we can't look at ourselves  
And realize everybody creates his own hell  
And if we put it together to make them all real  
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel  
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone  
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't  
Could we be suckered into thinking that  
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss  
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause  
What if we died and had to come back  
How may times would we have to go 'round  
What if tomorrow was the end of the line  
Don't want to feel like I wasted my time  
So what the hell's going on  
When the noise gets so dense  
you can't hear yourself think  
We got the spirit world on a telephone link  
So welcome to my revolution
