In my own simple way  
I think she wants me only  
She said, "Come over right away"  
But she's just not that way  
Her little soul is stolen  
See her put on her brand new face  
  
[Chorus]  
Go on and pull the shades  
Razor blades  
You're so tragic  
Go on, I hate you so  
But love you more  
I'm so elastic  
Of all the things you say  
The games you play  
Dirty magic stuff  
  
I should know better than to think I'd reach inside her  
It's all a cloudy kind of daze  
She's not so sweet today  
She mocks me, I'm no fighter  
It all just seems like such a waste  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's oversimplified  
It's oversimplified  
It's oversimplified  
  
[Chorus]
