Little girl  
Little girl kisses her mom  
Tells her I love you  
Holds on to her neck  
  
Little girl doesn't have much  
She walks with a smile  
She's so full of life  
  
But she cries in the night  
Just to try to hold on  
No one can hear her  
She's all alone  
  
This little girl closes her eyes  
All that she wants  
Is someone to love  
Someone to love  
  
Little girl  
She's all grown up  
Oh she's getting fevers  
She's a big star  
  
Oh little girl  
  
Fights with her mom  
Can't believe money  
Changed who she loved  
  
And she cries in the night  
Just to try to hold on  
But no one can hear her  
She's all alone  
  
This little girl closes her eyes  
All that she wants  
Is someone to love  
Someone to love  
  
She cries in the night  
Just to try to hold on  
No one can hear her  
She's all alone  
  
This little girl closes her eyes  
All that she wants  
Is someone to love (Someone)  
Someone to love (Someone)  
To love (Someone)  
Someone
