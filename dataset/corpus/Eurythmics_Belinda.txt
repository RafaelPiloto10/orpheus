Belinda the rain is falling  
Belinda your love is calling  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Belinda your mind is dreaming  
Belinda it's so misleading  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
How the rain still falls  
  
Belinda your eyes have spoken  
Belinda your heart is broken  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Dry your tears  
Close your eyes
