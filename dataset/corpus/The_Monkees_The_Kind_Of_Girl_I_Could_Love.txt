Girl, you look mighty good to me  
And I know that you've got to be  
The kind of girl I could love.  
  
You've got the sweetest pair of eyes  
And your kiss would be paradise  
You're the kind of girl I could love.  
  
You do something to my soul  
That no one's ever done.  
If you're looking for true love  
Then let me be the one.  
  
Girl, deep in my soul I'm sure  
And my heart has no doubt that you're  
The kind of girl I could love.  
The kind of girl I could love.
