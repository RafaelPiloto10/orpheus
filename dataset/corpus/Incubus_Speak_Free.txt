You took our lives away  
To increase your self esteem.  
An underlie in the public eye.  
Your dubbed insane if and when you try to  
Speak your mind  
In your own way!  
Ignore the past and  
  
Speak free!  
You smashed glass eyes just to say,  
"it all is all that I need."  
What you see  
Is a reflection of my choice  
And what it means to me.  
Trapped in your cell.  
  
A mindless plot against own eyes  
To simplify your hell!  
Just ease my pain!
