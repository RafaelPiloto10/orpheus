Who's that hiding in the tree top?  
It's that rascal, The Jitterbug!  
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,  
Keep away from, The Jitterbug!  
  
Oh! the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees have a terrible,
horrible  
Buzz!,  
But the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees couldn't do what The  
Jitterbug does!  
So be careful of that rascal, Keep away from The Jitterbug!  
  
The Jitterbug!  
  
Oh! The Jitter! Oh The Bug!  
Oh! The Jitterbug, Bug-a-bug, bug-a-bug, bug-a-boo.  
In a twitter, in the throes, Oh the critter's  
Got me dancing on a thousand toes,  
Thar' she blows!  
  
Oh! the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees have a terrible,
horrible  
Buzz!,  
But the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees couldn't do what The  
Jitterbug does!  
So be careful of that rascal, Keep away from The Jitterbug!
