Baby baby baby got to say what's on my mind  
Tomorrow you are leaving and i will be left behind  
Nothing only changing you're doing what you got to do  
One moment between us  
One moment to cling to you  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
(hear your body call)  
  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
(hear your body call)  
  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
  
Baby baby baby all the lights are going on  
(you just come in closer now just come in closer)  
  
We can can be together only till the night has gone  
(we should be together for the final time for ever)  
  
Somewhere in the future will you smile when you think of me  
(somewhere in the future some for the future)  
  
Somewhere in your heart will you hold a tender memory  
(some for the future always for the future)  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
(hear your body call)  
  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
(hear your body call)  
  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Won't you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Woah  
So let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
Let the hours craw
