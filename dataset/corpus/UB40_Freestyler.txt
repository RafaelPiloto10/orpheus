Say we a just freestyle it  
Because we wicked and wild it  
Because we know how fe run it  
And we just can't done it  
And you know say we like it  
And we have to excite it  
If you come a dance  
I say you might get frightin'  
Because you know say we live it  
And you say we love it  
There is very few things I coulda really put above it  
I love the booming of the base in a the speaker boxes  
The treble in the tweeters it just  
A tear off me hat see  
  
I said you just can't trap it  
I said you just can't unwrap it  
Say you justs can't take it  
Say you know you have to find it  
Deep down in a your soul I say you have to feel it  
Little after that you a go want to reveal it  
Coz music is a thing I say you  
Know you have to share it  
If me couldn't do that  
Me just couldn't bear it  
'cause the love for the music on me  
Sleeve me have fe wear it  
Deep down in a me heart I said you  
Just couldn't tear it  
  
Me no like them journalist man  
Dem come from different land  
Say we is a white reggae band  
Open your eyes no man you must  
Be blind no man  
You gwan like your cool man  
Your heart must be black no man  
Full of bad intention  
We is dub organizer  
A little oder and wiser  
We no like wife beater spreading  
Love would be sweeter  
Out of many nations yes we are one  
Just like the motto if you is Jamiacon  
  
Deep in a the night the musics calling  
Deep in a we hearts you know we're  
falling in love  
It's like a religious calling  
Calling calling you better send out  
A warning  
Calling calling you better send out  
A warning
