We thought we could do it without love  
Kept tellin' ourselves that here's where it ends  
Your way is my way and it's shown  
Something that we never admit  
  
In changin' the way I was feeling  
Only love and joy makes it right  
Feel first, and love lasts forever  
I'll do it with you if that's what you like  
  
CHORUS:  
  
Better when we do it together  
Can't leave it alone  
Good things get away  
All the other ways we've gone don't matter  
Can't leave it alone  
Good things get away  
  
Remember when happy was with us  
And all his dreams were sung  
Such things are forgotten thereafter  
'Cause we had to go on with the show  
  
Things, different places, adventure, makin' love  
'Cause love was the way  
Golden exchange, lots of money  
And the best of it all at our feet
