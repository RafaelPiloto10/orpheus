You book the hotel I'll pack the bags honey  
You phone the airlines I'll call a cab  
When will you return well that all depends  
Just tell your mother that you're staying with friends  
'Cause I know that you're my best friend's girl  
But it's the weekend I don't give a hell  
  
I'll bring the red wine you bring the ludes  
Your mother's doctor must be quite a dude  
We'll hang the 'Don't Disturb' outside our door  
I'm gonna rock you till your pussy's sore  
  
Oh my sweet Diana I can't wait for the manana  
There's a hotel down in Mexico just made for two  
But I don't think you trust me and I can't say I blame you  
My reputation precedes me you ain't never gonna leave me  
  
Soon as we get there I'll go check in  
Mr and Mrs Smith of Abilene  
You get naked honey I'll get down  
I'm gonna chase you around  
  
And 'round and 'round and 'round  
You say you can't stand monotony  
I say what happened to fidelity  
Dirty weekend made for two  
  
Just me and you honey  
I want to love that can last for ages  
not the trash you've been giving to strangers  
  
Don't want to make your two big brothers brothers annoyed  
Do you think you'll get the Polaroid?
