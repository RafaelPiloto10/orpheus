Come see, come see with spirit eyes  
Come see, the door is open  
Come near, come weary and ashamed  
Come near, His arms are open, His arms are open  
  
Come live, come live in freedom here  
Come live, the chains are broken  
Come rest, come take His gift of grace  
Come rest, the word is spoken, the word is spoken  
  
Come see, come see with spirit eyes  
Come see, the door is open  
Come home, come lay your burdens down  
Come home, His arms are open, His arms are open  
His arms are open, His arms are open, His arms are open  
  
His arms are open, His arms are open  
His arms are open, His arms are open  
His arms, His arms are open, His arms are open  
His arms are open, His arms are open, His arms are open  
  
The chains are broken, the chains are broken  
His arms are open, His arms are open, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah  
The world is broken, oh yeah, His arms are open
