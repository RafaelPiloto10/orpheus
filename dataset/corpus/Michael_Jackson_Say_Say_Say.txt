Say, say, say what you want but don't play games with my affection  
Take, take, take what you need but don't leave me with no direction  
All alone I sit home by the phone waiting for you baby (baby)  
Through the years how can you stand to hear my pleading for you dear?  
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah  
  
Now go, go, go where you want but don't leave me here forever  
You, you, you stay away so long, girl, I see you never  
What can I do, girl, to get through to you  
Cause I love you baby (baby)  
Standing here baptized in all my tears, baby through the years  
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
You never ever worry and you never shed a tear  
You're saying that my love ain't real  
Just look at my face, these tears ain't drying  
  
You, you, you can never say that I'm not the one who really loves you  
I pray, pray, pray every day that you'll see things, girl, like I do  
What can I do, girl, to get through to you  
Cause I love you (love you) baby (baby)  
Standing here baptized in all my tears, baby through the years  
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say
