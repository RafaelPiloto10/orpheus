Jet trails in the sky  
Leave one word behind  
A hand bangs into sand a name  
And we all understand  
  
Everybody's Lost  
But they're pretending they're not  
Lost  
Oh, lost  
  
Jet trails in the sky  
Leave one thought behind  
A hand bangs into sand a name  
And we all understand  
  
Everybody's Lost  
But they're pretending they're not  
Lost  
Oh, lost  
  
So if I see you  
And I tell you  
How I've watched you  
I'm just lost  
  
So if I see you  
And I tell you  
I've watched you  
Don't make fun of me later  
Cause I'm just Lost  
  
If I see you  
And I tell you  
How I've watched you  
Don't make fun of me later  
Cause I'm just lost  
  
If I see you  
And I tell you  
How I've watched you  
Don't make fun of me later  
Cause I'm just lost  
Lost lost lost lost lost lost
