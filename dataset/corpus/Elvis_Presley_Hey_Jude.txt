Hey Jude, don't be a fool  
Take a sad song and make it better  
The minute you let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey Jude, don't let me down  
Take a sad song and make it better  
The minute you let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
Let it out and let in  
Hey Jude begin  
To making the world a little better  
Don't you know that it's a fool  
Who plays it cool  
In making the world a little better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let it out and let in  
Hey Jude begin  
To making the world a little better  
Don't you know that it's a fool  
Who plays it cool  
To taking the world upon your shoulder  
  
[Chorus]
