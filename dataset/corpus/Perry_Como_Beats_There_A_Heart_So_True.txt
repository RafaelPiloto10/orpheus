Someone who would try to understand  
Someone who'd be thrilled to touch my hand  
An' through all eternity, she'd be good for only me  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
Someone who could make her lips so warm  
That my lonely heart could brave each storm  
Someone who'd be miles away, still within her heart I'd stay  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
Or, did I ask too much, when I met you?  
Or, was the task too much to just be a little true?  
I've been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart won't crack a smile  
  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
I've been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart won't crack a smile  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
So true
