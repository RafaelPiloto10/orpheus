(over importance of money)  
I've no time for boring things  
There's no religion  
That can make my heart sing, no  
They call me up  
Say: hey come on down  
We've got credit salvation  
All over town  
And I can see it everywhere I go  
I can hear it on my radio  
They keep telling me it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
Is their sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
Just need your love girl, every time  
We don't need these  
Pointless things  
We just need to mend  
Our broken wings  
Take a look, a look  
What's going down  
We've gotta stop  
Before we hit the ground  
Yeah, we can have it  
Don't you know  
Take part in their tv show  
They'll keep telling us it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
You can't fool me  
It's a waste of time  
You're selling tears  
Down the credit card line, yeah  
But giving up is not  
Their frame of mind  
They'll find a way  
To break us in time  
Yeah, I can meet you  
Everywhere I go  
And I can hear you on my radio  
You keep telling me it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
Is your sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I just need your love girl, every time  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
Just gimme your love girl  
Gimme your love, gimme your love  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I need your love girl  
Yeah, all the time  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I just need you girl, everytime
