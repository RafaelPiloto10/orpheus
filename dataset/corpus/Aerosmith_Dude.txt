Cruised into a bar on the shore  
Her picture graced a grime on his door  
She a long lost love at first sight  
Baby, mabye you're wrong  
But you know it's all right - that's right  
  
Back stage we're having the time  
Of our lives until somebody says  
'forgive me if i seem out of line'  
Then she whipped out a gun  
Tried to blow me away  
  
(chorus)  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
  
So never judge a book by it's cover  
Or who you gonna love by your lover  
Love put me wise to her love in disguise  
She had the body of a venus  
Lord, imagine my surprise  
  
(chorus)  
  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Let me take a peak dear  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Do me, do me, do me all night  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Turn the other cheek dear  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Do me, do me, do me, sue me  
  
What a funky lady  
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it  
Oh, he was a lady  
  
(repeat chorus)
