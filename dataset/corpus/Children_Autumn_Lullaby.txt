The sun has gone from the shining skies,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
The dandelions have closed their eyes,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
The stars are lighting their lamps to see  
If babes and squirrels and birds and bees,  
Are sound asleep as they should be,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
  
The squirrel keeps warm in his furs of gray,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
'Neath feathers, birdies are tucked away,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
In yellow jackets, the bees sleep tight  
And cuddle close through the chilly night,  
My baby's snug in her gown of white,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
  
The squirrel nests in a big oak tree,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
He finds a hole in the trunk, you see,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
The robin's home is a nest o'erhead,  
The bees, they nest in a hive instead,  
My baby's nest is her little bed,  
Bye, baby, bye.
