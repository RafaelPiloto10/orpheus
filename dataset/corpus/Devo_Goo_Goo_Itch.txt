Itchy, itchy goo  
Got me thinking of you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo  
Oh, baby, i love you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo  
It's all i want to do, whammo  
Itchy, itchy goo  
There's a pile next to you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo  
And it's turnin blue  
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo  
It's all i want to do, whammo  
You got me running in circles  
Like a pee-pee baby  
I'm so happy i just want to die  
Cause this baby love  
It comes from up above  
Move on over  
I want to get closer  
Move on over  
want to twaddle with you  
Move on over  
Satisfy my urges  
Please, please help  
I got the goo, goo itch  
You got me running in circles  
Like a big-big baby
