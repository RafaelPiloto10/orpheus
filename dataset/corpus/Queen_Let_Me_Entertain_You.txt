Hey it's a sell out - hey  
Let me welcome you Ladies and Gentlemen  
I would like to say hello  
Are you ready for some entertainment?  
Are you ready for a show?  
Gonna rock you gonna roll you  
Get you dancing in the aisles  
Jazz you, razzmatazz you  
With a little bit of style  
C'mon let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
  
I've come here to sell you my body  
I can show you some good merchandise  
I'll pull you and I'll pill you  
I'll crueladeville you  
And to thrill you I'll use any device  
  
A ha ha ha haa  
  
We'll give you crazy performance  
We'll give you grounds for divorce  
We'll give you piece de resistance  
And a tour de force of course  
  
We found the right location  
Got a lot of pretty lights  
The sound and the amplification listen  
Hey if you need a fix if you want a high  
Stickells I'll see to that  
With Electra and EMI  
We'll show you where it's at  
So c'mon let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
Let me entertain you  
  
Just take a look at the menu  
We give you rock a la carte  
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's  
We'll sing to you in Japanese  
We're only here to entertain you  
  
If you want to see some action  
You get nothing but the best  
The 'S' and 'M' attraction  
We've got the pleasure chest  
Chicago down to New Orleans  
We get you on the line  
If you dig the New York scene  
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time  
C'mon  
Let me entertain, let me entertain  
Let me entertain you tonight  
  
Hey where's my backstage pass ?  
Hey that Brian May he's outta sight man  
Hey that was a bit of alright wasn't it  
Outrageous costumes  
Not many not many  
And I always wanted to be in opera  
Oh man I could give you lessons if you like
