Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson, deeno  
I'm sitting in a place where the sun is shining  
Looking up where the birds are flying  
Not afraid as the sea is running high  
'cause I know you are right by my side  
Holding me when I'm feeling so small  
Saving me when I'm starting to fall  
I'm about to fall, but your standing tall  
The memories of you is a loving mother  
Making sure we would stay together  
Sometimes you're the bigger sister too  
When we needed someone to talk to  
Always there with your arms open wide  
I know it's best but I can't stop wonder  
Why it had to end this way  
Grandmother she leaves today  
Chorus:  
It's over now  
There's a song that they sing in a big bright city  
Yes it's over now  
There's a song and it's song by a choir of angels  
Saving you from all your pain  
To heaven beautiful heaven  
Singing for you....  
It's been some time since you got the message  
You've been brave, you've been strong all through this  
When they said there was nothing they could do  
You took care of the ones around you  
Never felt sorry for yourself  
All you wanted was to live a little longer time  
You said to me but God is kind to you you see  
Chorus  
And on and on the angels sing  
And on and on the choir sing for you, beautfiful you  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on we all will be together  
Sooner or later  
Together with you...  
I miss the times when I stopped by  
I still remember our last goodbye  
You were standing in the door waiting for me  
Like thousand times before  
Chorus  
I miss the times  
I miss the times with you  
And this one's for you  
And this one's for you
