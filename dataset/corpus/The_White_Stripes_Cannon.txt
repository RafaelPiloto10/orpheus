Outside  
My door  
Unlocked  
I'm lookin'  
At this sound  
That chime out of nowhere  
Yeah, nowhere  
Whoo  
Wheels turnin'  
Scratchin'  
And burnin'  
Yeah  
I fought guns  
Tanks  
Cannon  
Cannon  
Yeah  
Tell me who's that writin'  
John the revelator  
Tell me who's that writin'  
John the revelator  
Tell me who's that writin'  
John the revelator  
Wrote the book on the seven seas  
Christ went down on Easter mornin'  
Mary mother went down to see it  
Gotta tell my disciples to meet me in Galilee  
Who's writin'  
John the revelator  
Tell me who's that writin'  
John the revelator  
Tell me who's that writin'  
John the revelator  
Wrote the book on the seven seas
