Across the evening sky  
All the birds are leaving  
But how can they know  
It's time for them to go?  
Before the winter fire  
I will still be dreaming  
I do not count the time  
For who knows where the time goes?  
Who knows where the time goes?  
  
Sad deserted shore  
Your fickle friends are leaving  
Ah, then you know  
It's time for them to go  
But I will still be here  
I have no thought of leaving  
You know I have no thought of time  
For who knows where the time goes?  
Who knows where the time goes?  
  
And I am not alone  
While my love is near me  
I know it will be so  
Until it's time to go  
So come the storms of winter  
And then the birds in spring again  
I do not fear the time  
For who knows where the time goes?  
Who knows where the time goes?
