I had a dream  
You were so near to me  
but when I woke you were gone  
when I woke you were gone  
  
Thinking of you  
being so far away  
I guess I got memories  
guess I got memories  
  
When I am alone I feel your golden hair  
Skyline of silver-blue  
Trying to find words to pacify  
my feelings of loneliness for you  
  
(Repeat)  
I had a dream  
You are so near to me  
but when I wake you are gone  
when I wake you are gone  
when I wake you are gone
