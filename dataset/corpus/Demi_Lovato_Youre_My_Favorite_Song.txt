Words don't come easy without a melody  
I'm always thinking in terms of do-re-mi  
I should be hiking, swimming, laughing with you  
Instead I'm all out of tune  
  
But what you don't know  
You lift me off the ground  
You're inspiration, you helped me find myself  
Just like a baseline in half-time  
You hold down the groove  
That's why I'm counting on you  
  
And if I heard you on the radio  
I'd never wanna change a single note  
It's what I'm trying to say all along  
You're my favorite song  
  
I'm in a session writing tracks  
You've got another class to teach  
And then rehearsal with a band  
You're always one step out of reach  
I'm looking for some harmony  
With you it comes so naturally  
You helped me find the right key  
  
And when I hear you on the radio  
I'd never wanna change a single note  
It's what I tried to say all along  
You're my favorite song  
  
My favorite song!  
  
And when I hear you on the radio (yeah, yeah)  
I'd never wanna change a single note (no, no)  
It's what I tried to say all along  
  
You're my favorite song  
You're my favorite song
