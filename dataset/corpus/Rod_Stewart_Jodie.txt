Ooh hoo  
Just a telegram  
When your plane touches down  
Are you sure that I ain't talking to myself ?  
And when the seatbelt sign goes on,  
You know you're not alone  
'Cause Jodie I still love ya'  
All the while  
  
And I wish ya' all the best  
With your current success  
Don't let the flash boys turn your head  
And I don't mind you havin' friends  
But your love is not to lend  
  
'Cause Jodie I still love ya'  
Always thinkin' of ya'  
Jodie I still love ya'  
All the while  
  
And I'm gonna have to get by anyway, hmmm  
And you know with the winter comin' on, it's gonna be so hard  
And I really really really really don't miss ya' anyway, not anyway  
And you know how I lie  
Hmm, oww  
  
So I wish you all the best  
With your current success  
Don't let the flash boys turn your head  
And I don't mind ya' havin' friends,  
But your love is not to lend, remember  
  
Jodie I still love ya'  
I'm always thinkin' of ya'  
Jodie I still love ya'  
All the while  
Jodie I still love ya'  
I'm always thinkin' of ya'  
Jodie I still love ya'  
All the time
