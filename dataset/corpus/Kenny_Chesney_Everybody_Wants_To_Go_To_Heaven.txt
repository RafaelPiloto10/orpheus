Preacher told me last Sunday morning  
Son, you better start living right  
You need to quit the women and whiskey  
And carrying on all night  
  
Don't you wanna hear him call your name  
When you're standing at the pearly gates  
I told the preacher, "Yes I do"  
But I hope they don't call today  
I ain't ready  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven  
Have a mansion high above the clouds  
Everybody want to go to heaven  
But nobody want to go now  
  
Said preacher maybe you didn't see me  
Throw an extra twenty in the plate  
There's one for everything I did last night  
And one to get me through today  
Here's a ten to help you remember  
Next time you got the good Lord's ear  
Say I'm coming but there ain't no hurry  
I'm having fun down here  
Don't you know that  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven  
Get their wings and fly around  
Everybody want to go to heaven  
But nobody want to go now  
  
Someday I want to see those streets of gold in my halo  
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so  
  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
But nobody wanna go now  
  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
But nobody wanna go now  
I think I speak for the crowd
