Ehhh  
Wyclef with Pitbull,  
The clubs ain't safe tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Mamacita so nice to meet ya,  
You drunk off that rum,  
You shouldn't drive tonight,  
Give me the key to that Beamer,  
She looked at me and laughed,  
Started shakin her ass,  
She said her brother just came home  
From the jungle  
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh  
Oh  
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh  
Oh  
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh  
Oh  
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh  
  
It's a jungle sometimes.  
It makes me wonder  
How I keep from goin under  
With all these around me.  
I got em all colors, shapes and sizes,  
I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.  
Spike lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'jungle
fever'.  
'cause I like em a little bit darker  
Take it from the back to the front, rosa parkuh  
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference  
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy  
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen  
Coffee with no cream,  
That's like a rock with no fiend  
Martin Luther king with no dream,  
John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing  
And for those that don't know nothin,  
Welcome to the jungle,  
'Clef tell em somethin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Como?  
If you got that hot blood  
Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente,  
Turn around now back up,  
Preparate mujer porque mi lengua esta fuerte,  
Morenita que rica esta,  
She don't speak Spanish, ay mama,  
That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya,  
And by the end of the night you'll say ay papa.  
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women  
Light skin red bones they blow my mind  
I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em  
Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine  
Stop playin with me  
Say it with me,  
Dale papi, dale papi oh  
And for those that don't know nothin,  
Welcome to the jungle,  
'Clef tell em somethin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's that jungle fever  
Fever  
It's that jungle fever  
Fever,  
Watch out watch out  
It's that jungle fever  
Fever  
It's that jungle fever  
Fever  
It's that jungle fever  
Fever  
Watch out watch out  
It's that jungle fever  
  
Now what I'ma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall,  
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,  
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,  
What it means is, uh  
To get nasty  
To get freaky  
To do things you've never done before  
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.  
Whites, black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea.  
You know what I'm talkin bout, right clef?
