Though you don't call anymore  
I sit and wait in vain  
I guess I'll rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I want to tell you baby  
Changes I've been going through  
Missing you, listen you  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Why did you have to decide  
You had to set me free  
I'm gonna swallow my pride  
I'm gonna beg you to please  
Baby won't you please see me  
I'm gonna walk by myself  
To prove that my love is true  
Oh, for you baby  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Living for you my dear  
Is like living in a world of constant fear  
Hear my plea, I've got to make you see  
That our love is dying  
Our love is dying  
It's dying  
Although your phone you ignore  
Somehow I must explain  
I'm gonna rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I'm gonna camp on your step  
Until I get through to you  
I've got to change your view baby  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Yeah 'til you come back to me  
That's what I'll do  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do
