Blue moon, you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for  
  
And then suddenly appeared before me, the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'  
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold - oh oh oh  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own  
  
(Blue moon)
