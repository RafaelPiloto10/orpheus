The years have been so good to you and I my friend  
They brought us to the Autumn wind and left the tears behind  
And who'd have dreamed that love could grow so endlessly  
And you'd have meant so much to me, is it already time?  
  
And I will always love you so  
We'll hold each other close until it's time to go  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time?  
  
And I will always love you so  
We'll hold each other close until it's time to go  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time?  
  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time?
