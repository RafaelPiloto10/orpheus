The big line moved one mile an hour  
So loud it really hurt  
The big line moved so loud  
It really hurt  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We filled conveyors  
We met production  
Foremen didn't waste words  
We met production  
Foremen didn't waste words  
We were young and proud  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
They were long and low and sleek and fast  
They were all you ever heard  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
Now the years have flown and the plants have changed  
And you're lucky if you work  
The big line moves but you're lucky if you work  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
They were long and low and sleek and fast  
They were classic in a word  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were young and proud  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were young and sure  
We were makin' thunderbirds
