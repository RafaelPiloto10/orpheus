Baby, I've been thinking, it's too hard to speak these nights,  
Can I confess what's on my chest, what's really on my mind.  
See, I never was scared of nothing, there was nothing that we couldn't do,  
We used to think that we could walk on water, just because we wanted to.  
And it all seemed so easy, when we were living not just alive,  
We talked about dreams, and how we would like to spend our lives.  
  
When freedom was a tank of gas, on a long summer night,  
To drive, just drive.  
  
Can you keep a secret baby, if you can't, just lie,  
Yeah, I want to scream, when I have this dream, that my whole life passed me  
By.  
And they sold my heart for diamonds, and they sold some pride for gold,  
There's lots of things that I can't get back, that the record company owns.  
When 17 has turned 30, it's all gone kiss it goodbye.  
Hey baby, maybe we aint kids no more, but I'm too young to die.  
  
There's still some freedom in this tank of gas, if you're by my side,  
We'll drive, just drive.  
  
Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, with you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board.  
We'll drive, with the radio on.  
  
You can lean your head on my shoulder, and just for a while,  
Forget about the world, baby, mile after mile.  
We'll drive, all night long yeah, you want a ride?  
  
No airplane, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, and you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board,  
We'll drive, with the radio on baby all right.
