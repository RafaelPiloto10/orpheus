Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Running down the road  
Make my get away  
Everything I told you  
Was just yesterday  
Yes, You know I'm off again  
Oh, and I've been told  
You were there beside me  
Running down the road  
Walking down the street  
Meet me down the line  
Police car at my feet  
They were there on time  
Everybody's looking for  
Something to explode  
How can you afford the time  
Running down the road  
My feet are getting tired  
My head begins to spin  
Who of us is dreaming  
You or me or him?  
Yes, You know I'm waiting  
While these times unfold  
Looking backward briefly  
Running down the road  
(Repeat first verse)
