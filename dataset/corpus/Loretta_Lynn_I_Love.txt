I love little baby ducks old pickup trucks slow moving trains and rain  
I love little country streams sleep without dreams Sunday school in May and
hay  
And I love you too  
  
I love leaves in the wind pictures of my friends birds of the world and
squirrels  
I love coffee in a cup little fuzzy pupps wine in a glass and grass  
And I love you too  
  
I love honest open smiles kisses from a child tomatoes on the vine and onions  
I love winners when they cry losers when they try music when it's good and
life  
And I love you too
