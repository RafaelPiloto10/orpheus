This is the hour when the mysteries emerge.  
A strangeness so hard to reflect.  
A moment so moving, goes straight to your heart,  
The vision has never been met.  
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside,  
Something I'll never forget.  
  
The pattern is set, her reaction will start,  
Complete but rejected too soon.  
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear,  
Recalls the life that we knew.  
The shadow that stood by the side of the road,  
Always reminds me of you.  
  
How can I find the right way to control,  
All the conflicts inside, all the problems beside,  
As the questions arise, and the answers don't fit,  
Into my way of things,  
Into my way of things.
