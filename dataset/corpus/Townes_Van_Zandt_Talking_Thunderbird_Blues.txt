Among the strangest things I ever heard  
Was when a friend of mine said "Man, let's get some Thunderbird"  
I said "What's that?" he just started to grin  
Slobbered on his shirt, his eyes got dim  
He said "You got fifty-nine cents?"  
  
I said "Yeah, I got a dollar, but don't be a smartalec  
I ain't gonna spend it on no Indian relic"  
And he said "Thunderbird's not an old Indian trinket,  
It's a wine, man, you take it home and drink it."  
I said "It sure don't sound like wine to me"  
And he said he'd bet me the change from my dollar  
  
We hustled on down to the nearest you-Tate-Um  
The guy wanted my ID, I whipped her out and showed him  
He got a green bottle from the freezing vault  
My friend started doing backward somersaults  
Through the cottage cheese  
  
Took it back to his house, started drinkin'  
Pretty soon I set in to thinkin'  
"Man, this Thunderbird tastes yummy, yummy, yummy  
And I know it's doing good things to my tummy, tum, t"  
It's so you reason when your on that crap  
  
Got a few more bottles, chugged them down  
I pulled myself up off the ground  
Decided I go see my dearest sweet wife  
Who met me at the door with a carving knife  
Said "Get them damn grape peel from between your teeth."  
  
I could see we're gonna have a little misunderstanding  
I said "Dear, I better get in touch with you later"  
She said "Forget it, man, you're never touchin' me again!"  
  
Now I've seen the light and heard the word  
And I'm staying away from that ol' dirty Thunderbird  
A message come from heaven radiant, and fine,  
All I drink now is communion wine  
Six days a week
