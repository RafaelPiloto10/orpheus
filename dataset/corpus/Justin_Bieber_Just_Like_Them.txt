I know it's hard but  
Let's go  
  
There's something different in your eyes baby  
You can't seem to look into mine lady  
Tell me what is on your mind baby  
Or I'm gonna assume that something's wrong  
  
Chorus:  
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed  
'Cause all those other women couldn't get it let's...  
And I'm not barely trippin I just can't do this again  
Please don't tell me you're just like them  
Please don't tell me you're just like them  
You're just like them  
  
I know that it's hard to trust of  
But you need the trust that my love  
Whether I need you in the dust  
  
Chorus:  
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed  
'Cause all those other women couldn't get it let's...  
And I'm not barely trippin I just can't do this again  
Please don't tell me you're just like them  
Please don't tell me you're just like them  
You're just like them  
  
Baby you ain't get this love on track  
Will you run away gotta wait on after love back  
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you're waiting for  
You gotta know know know know  
Know know know know know know  
Know know know know know know  
  
[Chorus:]
