If a foolish fool like me  
Can read you easily  
Then something must be wrong  
  
Something's different when we speak  
It seems the past few weeks  
Our love's not been so strong  
  
Lovers have always had this problem  
Ask anyone, you'll see  
We've got to hang on til it passes  
Don't give up easily  
  
If we say what's on our minds,  
We'd save a lot of time  
Don't give up easily  
  
I know you're feeling bad  
Sometimes I make you sad  
But when you're feeling sad,  
I'm feeling just as bad  
  
During the good times it's so easy  
You are in love like me  
Sometimes we feel we want to leave it  
Don't give up easily  
  
If we say what's on our minds,  
We'd save a lot of time  
Don't give up easily  
Ask anyone, you'll see  
They'll say the same as me  
Don't give easily
