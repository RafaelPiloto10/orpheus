Natives wearing turquoise and silver  
Dirty dogs barking in the distance  
Oh people of a thousand tongues  
I'm learning the primitive rights  
I'm doing as the Romans do  
  
Mt. Kalais to Mt. Everest  
Then down to the River Ganges  
Oh to follow your mighty past  
We're learning the primitive rights  
We're doing as the Romans do  
  
Old world new world  
I know nothing  
But I'll keep dancing  
  
City's crumble into the ocean  
City's getting built in the sky  
Oh now we're talking digital  
We're learning the primitive rights  
We're doing as the Romans do  
  
Millions playing at Monopoly  
Rolling the dice of their life  
Oh I'm dancing and shaking hands  
We're learning the primitive rights  
We're doing as the Romans do  
  
Old world new world  
I know nothing  
But I'll keep listening
