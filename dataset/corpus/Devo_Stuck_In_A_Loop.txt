When you hear would should coulda  
Gotta think mighta been in spite of  
Low down tired of being a fighter  
Turn around put it all behind you  
Caught in a trap and you can't walk out  
It's in your mind so you can't walk out  
Now don't get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well you're gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
When you hear maybe baby someday  
Gotta say when do I get it my way  
Freeze-dried waitin' for the big day  
Get wise take another freeway  
Caught in a trap and you can't walk out  
It's in your mind so you can't walk out  
Just when you think you've got it beat  
It sets you up and knocks you down  
Try to blow it off or trade it in  
You'll wind up in the lost and found  
And then you're stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well you're gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Maybe random maybe a scam  
Fate lays waste to the greatest plans  
That's life  
Talk about karma moan about sin  
Just don't get stuck in that loop again  
'Cause that's life
