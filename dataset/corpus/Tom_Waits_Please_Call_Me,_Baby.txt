The evening fell just like a star  
Left a trail behind  
You spit as you slammed out the door  
If this is love we're crazy  
As we fight like cats and dogs  
But I just know there's got to be more  
  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets  
We do crazy things when we're wounded  
Everyone's a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Out walking in the rain  
  
I admit that I ain't no angel  
I admit that I ain't no saint  
I'm selfish and I'm cruel and I'm blind  
If I exorcise my devils  
Well my angels may leave too  
When they leave they're so hard to find  
  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets  
We do crazy things when we're wounded  
Everyone's a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Out walking in the rain  
  
We're always at each other's throats  
It drives me up the wall  
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam  
And I wish to God you'd leave me  
And I wish to God you'd stay  
Life's so different than it is in your dreams  
  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets  
We do crazy things when we're wounded  
Everyone's a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Out walking in the rain
