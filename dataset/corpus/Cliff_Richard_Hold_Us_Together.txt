Nothing ever stays the same  
Everything must change  
Just take a look around you  
You know it will astound you  
History unfolding shows us  
Good intentions pass  
And a love once pledged in moonlight  
Isn't guaranteed to last  
Chorus:  
(only your love is constant baby)  
(only my love for you)  
Only your love can hold us together  
Only you - and everything you do  
Just one kiss and my dreams come true  
Only you - and everything you say  
Only loving you - can make me feel this way  
People who just play at love  
Make loving something cheap  
And it's only worth the playing if we  
Play the game for keeps  
The book of life has pages girl  
That you and I must turn  
And in every chapter in every story  
Something there to learn  
Repeat chorus  
Love is patient, love is kind  
Love is rarely ever blind  
Take a look and you will find  
That love is just caring  
And sharing our loving together
