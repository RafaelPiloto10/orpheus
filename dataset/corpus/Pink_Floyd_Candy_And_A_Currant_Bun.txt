Oh, my girl sitting in the sky  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Lay back  
Don't talk to me  
Please, just fuck with me  
Please, you know I'm feeling frail  
It's true, sun shining very bright  
It's you, I'm gonna love tonight  
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon  
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon  
Don't touch me child  
Please, know you drive me wild  
Please you know, I'm feeling frail  
Don't try another cat  
Don't go where other you must know why  
Very, very, very frail  
Oh, my girl sitting in the sun  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Like that
