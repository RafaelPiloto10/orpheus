So many years have come and gone since then  
Still I can't forget the past  
But you and me, we'll surelt meet again  
And maybe find the truth at last  
  
And the light, in the night  
Shines on brightly  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright with me  
  
Well I believe, that fate will find a way  
To guide us through these restless years  
And yes I know, that we'll speak one day  
With no more doubts and no more fears  
  
And the light ..  
  
So tell me now, if you can share my view  
Tell me where your comin' from  
We've both had time, time to think it through  
To know just where we both belong  
  
And the light ..  
  
And if your heart is real  
Then tell me how you feel  
'Til I'm saying  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright with me  
It's quite alright with me  
It's all alright with me
