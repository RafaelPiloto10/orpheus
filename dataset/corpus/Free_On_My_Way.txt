She talks to me of wisdom  
We walk beside the sun  
Rainy night and rainy day  
Might as well keep away  
I've got trouble on the run  
Weariness  
Weariness has left my friend  
My head goes round  
And round again  
On my way and I might be late  
I don't worry  
Every thing can wait  
  
She talks to me of feelin'  
Feelin' good  
And feelin' better  
Once upon a time I thought  
I could love around and not get caught  
But I'd never met her  
Weariness, waeriness has left my friend  
Head goes round  
And round again  
I'm on my way  
And I might be late  
I don't worry every thing can wait  
  
Do you mean  
When you say you'll be mine  
I want you to be mine  
All mine  
Weariness  
Weariness has left my friend  
My head goes round  
And round again  
On my way and I might be late  
I don't worry  
Every thing can wait  
Every thing can wait
