(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
She's a special girl who wants to treat me right  
I can tell by the way that she walks  
A woman of the world who likes the city lights  
I can tell by the way that she talks  
I can't remember where it happened all too fast  
I don't know what you really want me to say  
But when she walked on by there was no turning back  
I knew she'd steal my emotions away  
Oh all this talk about what's wrong or right  
We gotta get to the bottom of this tonight  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now I've got trouble in mind (Little trouble)  
  
The word will get around that's just the way it is  
But don't believe everything that you hear  
'Cause when it all comes down to a love like this  
All the rumors will soon disappear  
Oh love can travel on a broken line  
But baby everybody has to take a chance sometime  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now I've got some, some trouble in mind  
  
Somehow there's something that I'm missin'  
I can't let you know oh-no  
(Right now) I gotta try and make you listen  
I'll be back in time  
Waiting at the end of the line  
  
Love can travel on a broken line  
Everybody has to take a chance sometime  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
'Cause we can always look back on what should have been  
'Cause you know honey right now I've got trouble in mind  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But baby right now I've got trouble in mind  
  
Nothin but trouble  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
Lock me up and throw away the key  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
I've got it bad  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)...
