[Verse]  
I cannot take this anymore  
Saying everything I said before  
All these words, they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear, the less you say  
You'll find that out anyway  
  
Just like before...  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
  
[Verse 2]  
I find the answers aren't so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts, they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
  
Just like before...  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to... break!  
  
[Hook]  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
I'm about to break!  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to... break!
