I went out today for a walk in the rain  
I was so sad and blue I could feel any pain  
I was worried about everything my head began to howl  
I am running away from myself there's  
Too many demons around here now  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
  
But that can't happen and everybody knows it's true  
And if you have to know I'll never understand you  
So if you have to go then you'd better go now  
Go off somewhere safe I hope you will somehow  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away
