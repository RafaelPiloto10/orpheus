Michael McGrory from west Donegal  
You came to Glasgow with nothing at all  
You fought the landlord then the Africa Korps  
When you came to Glasgow with nothing at all  
  
Abraham Caplan from Vilnius you came  
You were heading for New York but Leith's where you've stayed  
You built a great business which benefits all  
Since you came to this land with nothing at all  
  
In Scotland's story I read that they came  
The Gael and the Pict, the Angle and Dane  
But so did the Irishman, Jew and Ukraine  
They're all Scotland's story and they're all worth the same  
  
Joseph D'Angelo dreams of the days  
When Italian kids in the Grassmarket played  
We burned out his shop when the boys went to war  
But auld Joe's a big man and he forgave all  
  
In Scotland's story I'm told that they came  
The Gael and the Pict, the Angle and Dane  
But where's all the Chinese and Indian names?  
They're in my land's story and they're all worth the same  
  
Christina McKay, I learned of your name  
How you traveled south from Delny one day  
You raised a whole family in one room they say  
And the X on the line stands in place of your name  
  
So in the old story I'll bet that I came  
From Gael and Pict and Angle and Dane  
And a poor migrant girl who could not write her name  
It's a common old story but it's mine just the same  
  
All through the story the immigrants came  
The Gael and the Pict, the Angle and Dane  
From Pakistan, England and from the Ukraine  
We're all Scotland's story and we're all worth the same  
Your Scotland's story is worth just the same
