Mother told me, yes she told me  
I'd meet girls like you  
She also told me stay away  
You'll never know what you'll catch  
  
Just the other day I heard  
Of a soldier's falling off  
Some Indonesian junk  
That's going 'round  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Father says your mother's right  
She's really up on things  
Before we married Mommy served  
On the WACs in the Philippines  
  
Now I had heard the WACs recruited  
Old maids for the war  
But Mommy's neither one of those  
I've known her all these years  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Whatever happened to all this season's  
Losers of the year  
Every time I got to thinking  
Where'd they disappear  
  
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad  
Are rolling on the couch  
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling  
Got my Kiss records out  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Away
