First there was nothing  
Till I created the word  
First there was nothing  
And nothing was good  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing was heard  
  
And who am I anyway  
If I don' t have a name  
If moving is nothing  
And nothing is shame  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing' s the same  
  
And the word is me  
And I am the word  
My mind is free  
Like a beautiful bird  
And the terms of love  
And the germs of hate  
Nothing is waiting  
Nothing is waiting  
  
First there was darkness  
Till I created the night  
First there was darkness  
And darkness was right  
Darkness is moving  
Darkness is moving  
Into light  
  
And the word is me  
And I am the word  
My mind is free  
Like a beautiful bird  
And the terms of love  
And the germs of hate  
Nothing is waiting  
  
First there was darkness  
Till I created the night  
First there was darkness  
And darkness was right  
Darkness is moving  
Into light...
