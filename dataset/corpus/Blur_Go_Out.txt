[Intro]  
Uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh,  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm gettin' sad alone, dancing with myself  
Greedy go-getter goal, the luxury of stealth  
I'm seedy and the whole, dancing with myself  
I get into my bed, I do it to myself  
  
[Chorus]  
To the local, to the lo-o-o, I go out  
To the local, by myself  
To the local  
  
[Verse 2]  
I did it to my head, there's nothing to be addressed now  
There's nothing to get up about, cause we do it all the time  
The shepherd is undone, she done it all again  
I get ready to go, the greed go-getter con  
  
[Chorus 2]  
He going to the local oohh  
He going to the local oohh  
He going to the lo-o-cal oohh  
He going to the lo-o-cal oohh  
  
[Verse 3]  
To many western men, it's a problem left undone  
Imperious the sign, the papers of luxury  
A greedy go-getter in the skybox, she run alone  
She get ready to go, she does it with herself  
  
She does it with herself  
She does it with herself  
She does it on her own  
She does it on her own  
  
Uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh  
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
