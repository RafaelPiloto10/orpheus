I have to sit down for  
Ok, we'll, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you  
There's a young man here at, at uh San Quentin  
Tonight that wrote a song that I just  
Saw written down on paper for the first time yesterday  
He sent me the sheet music on it,  
And I don't know anyone that reads music  
Except, maybe Helen  
And um, I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you
know  
The first thing that come to my mind  
Hey, lemme see that, let's just try a little bit of it right here  
  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day and  
And I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Can't stand locks, bars or doors  
Mean cops insanity and wars  
Gotta find a place of peace  
Till then much travelin' won't cease  
But I don't know where I'm bound  
  
There's gotta be a place for me  
Under some green growing tree  
Clear cool water running by  
An unfettered view of the sky  
But I don't know where I'm bound  
  
When I die don't bury me  
Cause then I must be free  
Cremate my body with a grin  
Throw my ashes to the wind  
Cause I don't know where I'm bound  
  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day  
And I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Got myself a little gal  
She has been a damn right pall  
That ol' highway's calling me  
And free I gotta be but  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Thank you very much
