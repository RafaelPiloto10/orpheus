Swag so turnt up I walk past a bitch  
I don't need a bitch, don't even aks for shit  
I got a fly mouth and yea I talk nasty bitch  
Yo nigga used to have cash, now he broke as shit  
2002 man I was serving massive bricks  
Call me and my niggas Pacman the shit  
I can't fit in my past so rubber band the shit  
My mama kicked me out cuz she couldn't understand this shit  
I wish that I could turn but I'm not an evangelist  
I wanna go to church but I feel like a hypocrite  
Cuz when that work came in I had to sell this shit  
So many P's at the trap then they would smell the shit  
It's Guwop
