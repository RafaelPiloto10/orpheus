(Part one)  
At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming  
And the cars and the beast behind, they all start humming  
And ooh you got a cool machine, so let's get it runnin'  
We'll break the silence of the night  
And you know they're gonna hear us comin'  
We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk  
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark  
  
So baby one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
  
Artists got their easels, they're ready on the mark  
Gonna try and take the pictures  
Of the dust and the gold in the sparks  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
  
So just one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
I never wanna see you cry  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
  
(Part two)  
Ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready  
Under my foot gonna hit it down,  
Take this stance before the crowd  
Sleepin' city urban fall,  
Summer's sadness time to answer the call  
Cool machine, get it runnin', ready to roll  
Soft hands around my neck,  
One more kiss then it's time to connect  
Leave this child, leave me all alone,  
This one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
Ready, ready, ready to roll - this one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
  
(Part three)  
Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise  
Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
  
One more kiss, one more kiss, one more kiss, one more kiss  
One more kiss, one more kiss  
It brings a little luck, brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss, one more kiss, Ooh one more kiss  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'
