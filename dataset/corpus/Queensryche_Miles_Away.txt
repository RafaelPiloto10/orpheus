Where I'm looking everything seems clear.  
Not a worry as I float up here. Press me to explain?  
Searching deep down for the answer.  
  
I see the world in a different light, busy changing,  
rearranging. I'll be missing  
for a while, I've got a few things on my mind.  
  
Please leave me alone on this day.  
I'm in conversation miles away.  
Please leave me alone this afternoon,  
I'm in meditation high above.  
  
Fields of green and deep blue skies above.  
I'll share with you a place I'm thinking of.  
Play in the sunshine,  
sing my favorite song again and again.  
  
I see the world in a different light, busy changing,  
rearranging. I'll be missing  
for a while, I've got a few things on my mind.  
  
Please leave me alone on this day.  
I'm in conversation miles away.  
Please leave me alone this afternoon,  
I'm in meditation high up.
