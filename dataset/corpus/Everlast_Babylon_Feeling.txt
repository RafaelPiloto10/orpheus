My heart is broke, my will is gone  
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon  
She hook me to the gills all of her forbidden thrills  
I call her baby for short then I ramble on  
She'll forget about me  
  
My soul is high, my mind is free  
Met a shorty with some back call her Destiny  
She showed me all my fates, my stream of conscious navigates  
I orbit around the sun at high velocity  
Don't forget about me, don't forget about  
Sweet things won't you save my soul  
Pretty lady, won't you take me home  
Pretty lady, won't you take me home, tonight  
  
My arms are heavy, my body's tense  
Got the hot's for this honey named Confidence  
She points out all of my flaws, breaking all of her favorite laws  
Never speaks a word in my defense, just forget about me  
  
My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive  
Got a thing for this bitch said her name's a lie  
She controls me with her fear, my prayers fall on her cold deaf ear  
She says have a good time and take your dive  
Just forget about me, just forget about  
Sweet things, won't you save my soul (yeah)  
Pretty lady, won't you take me home  
Sweet thing won't you save my soul (yeah)  
Pretty lady won't you take me home...tonight  
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin'  
I've got a Babylon feelin', I'm feelin' Babylon  
  
My heart is broke, my will is gone  
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon  
She hook me to the gills, all of her forbidden thrills  
I call her baby for short then I ramble on, and I ramble on  
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin'  
I've got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah  
I've got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah  
I've got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah  
I've got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah
