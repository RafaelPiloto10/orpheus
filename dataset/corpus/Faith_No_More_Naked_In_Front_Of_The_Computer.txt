My box is full  
And my mouth is full  
And my life is full  
And now my memory's full  
  
In how many ways and words  
Can you say nothing  
Millions of ways and words  
To say nothing  
  
What'd I say? I'm empty.  
  
I bought the thing  
I thought the thing  
And I fought the thing  
  
They said it's normal  
But they're keeping me dumb and hot  
You're missing something  
Keeping me dumb and hot  
You must be missing something  
Keeping me dumb and hot  
  
What'd I say? I'm empty.  
  
And I'm sending it back to you
