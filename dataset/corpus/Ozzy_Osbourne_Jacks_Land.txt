Stop the night, the night  
My thoughts get louder after dark  
Oh the lies  
The crazies tell me this much  
Aha!  
  
It's a simple enough task boys  
To find a living miracle  
But the living ain't easy  
I need a shot of medecine  
  
Start the day, the day  
My head denies I'm breathing  
It likes to say  
Am I here or leaving me?  
  
There's a want I ask all the time  
Possesion of my right mind  
You're not deaf but I still have to shout  
Watch out there's a lot of thieves about  
  
All along the way  
I stand beside myself  
And look at all my world  
No need to tell me  
  
I see dead men playing  
I hear cries from many  
I hear tears and then some  
I hear hop I'm hoping  
  
I'm caught with all the shutters down  
Who's looking through my window?  
I had to close the saddest eyes  
  
You've got to be a winner  
You've got to be cool  
  
I see me inside you  
I hear fear and then some  
I see children playing  
I see hope I'm hoping  
  
Far away  
I hear a memory calling me  
I'd like to stay  
But my obsession wants to play
