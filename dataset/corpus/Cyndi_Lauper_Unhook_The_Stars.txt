Just when everything's in order and good, things fall apart  
Just when life should be resolving I'm back at the beginning,  
And it comes back to the heart ...  
I'm not really sad...I'm not running, I'm looking...  
Did I tell you I've saved all your letters and cards...  
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars...  
  
Do you remember when I told you all that I could and it seemed like too
much...  
Well I was living your life hoping you'd never fall...  
If I held on tight enough...  
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere...  
With time on my hands I can make a new start...  
I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars  
I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars  
  
Don't worry for me it's just I'm inspired  
Waiting in the wings made me drunk with possibility  
It rivals my memories...
