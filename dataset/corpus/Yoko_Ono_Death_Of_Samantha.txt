Two, one, two, three, four.  
People say I'm cool,  
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.  
Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
When I'm on the phone, I thank god,  
My voice sounds smooth and clear without a trace of tear.  
When I'm at work, I thank god,  
I still have that smile ma used to say lit her day.  
  
But something inside me, something inside me died that day.  
People say I'm cool,  
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.  
Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
When I'm with people, I thank god,  
I can talk hip when I'm crying inside.  
  
When I'm with friends, I thank god,  
I can lit a cigarette when I'm choking inside.  
  
People say I'm cool,

Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
A friend lent me shades  
So I could hide my eyes that day.  
Was a snowy day,  
The shades have seen a lot of things I didn't want to know myself.  
  
Was like an accident, part of growing up,  
People tell me.  
  
But something inside me, something inside me died that day.  
What do you do-oo? what can you do?  
What do you do-oo? what can you do?
