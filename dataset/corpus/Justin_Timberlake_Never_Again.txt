Would have given up my life for you  
Guess it's true what they say about love  
It's blind  
Girl, you lied straight to my face  
  
Lookin' in my eyes  
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life  
And all you had to do was apologize  
You didn't say you're sorry  
  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me again  
Sadness has me at the end of the line  
  
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine  
Loneliness only wants you back here with me  
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me  
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it  
  
But you didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me...  
  
Wish like Hell I could go back in time  
Maybe then I could see how  
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try  
But it's too late  
  
Its over now  
You didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
  
And now I'm half the man  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
You didn't love me enough...  
My heart may never mend  
  
And you'll never get to love me again  
Again...  
Again, again, again...  
Never get to love me...
