Moonlight shining on the back of my hand  
Cat fight rattlin' the garbage can  
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Wild wind blowing down the neck of my shirt  
Old men sitting on a bench in the dirt  
Seems that another ship has gone out to sea  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Shoe shine someone's got to tell ya the news  
A fine line separates a boy from the blues  
Looks like you could use some company  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Runnin', runnin' just as fast as I can  
Someone, someone take a hold of my hand  
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
Same thing, same thing happened to me.
