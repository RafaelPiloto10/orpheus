We were talking  
About the space between us all  
And the people  
Who hide themselves behind a wall  
Of illusion, never glimpse the truth  
Then it's far too late, when they pass away  
We were talking  
About the love we all could share  
When we find it  
To try our best to hold it there  
With our love, with our love  
We could save the world if they only knew  
Try to realize it's all within yourself  
No one else can make you change  
And to see you're really only very small  
And life flows on within you and without you  
We were talking  
About the love that's gone so cold  
And the people  
Who gain the world and lose their soul  
They don't know, they can't see  
Are you one of them?  
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find  
Peace of mind is waiting there  
And the time will come when you see we're all one  
And life flows on within you and without you
