The wages of an unskilled working man never paid enough  
From time to time a nickel on a race keeps him from giving up  
  
A blue collared man in Seattle never lives on white collared street  
But there was food on the table for my Washington woman and me  
  
The work slowed down and the one day  
The foreman laid me off  
That night in a tavern down on my last dime  
I met a girl from Arkensal  
  
Her daddy was a banker in Little Rock  
She had a mansion on white collared street  
The next morning my Washington woman woke up without me  
  
From city to city, and state to state, I get her in shame  
My Washington woman had six months left  
Before out child would bring her pain  
  
That Arkensal woman hurt me  
As we crossed the Arkensal line  
But the arms of Seattle  
Are the arms that kept huggin' mine  
  
For year I have basked in expensive wines  
Taste champagne every day  
I gave up all the things I loved  
For all these things I hate  
  
I locked up all of her forgiveness, the day I set myself free  
And the heart of my Washington woman stopped beating for me  
  
My Washington woman sends me a letter every once in a while  
Inside a folded wordless page is a picture of my child  
All but words, the room grows cold with a feeling of jealousy  
And there's a silence between  
My Arkensal woman and me
