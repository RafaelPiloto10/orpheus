I taste death in every kiss we share  
Every sundown seems to be the last we have  
Your breath on my skin has the scent of our end  
I'm drunk on your tears, Baby, can't you see it's hurting  
Every time we touch we get closer to heaven  
And at every sunrise our sins are forgiven  
Uh uh  
You on my skin this must be the end  
The only way you can love me ist to hurt me again  
And again  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Oh the taste from your lips, my Darling  
Taste from your lips, oh my Love  
  
Only inside I'm free  
I'm tired of waiting  
You've got to let me dream  
Inside Baby  
I'm not afraid to feel  
I want your to love me  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
