You said you would wait for me, but something went wrong  
The house was empty, your pictures gone  
I knew you'd come back one day, our love was so strong  
The past behind us, it's here you belong  
  
'Cause I'm deep inside you, you're deep inside me  
I always knew that we would always be  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Two hearts forever, one heart alone, I need to know your love is mine  
Two hearts forever, one heart alone, I won't let go of you this time  
  
You could've talked to me, what changed your mind  
I could have been there by your side  
You thought you could walk away, but you know that's a lie  
This loneliness is hard to hide  
  
It's so easy to surrender, and temptation always finds a way  
You must hold on, you know we must hold on, whoa-oh-oh  
  
Two hearts forever, one heart alone, I won't let go of you this time  
Take this heart of mine, whoa-oh-oh
