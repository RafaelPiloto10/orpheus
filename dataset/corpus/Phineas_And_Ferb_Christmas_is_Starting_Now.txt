Grab some holly and mistletoe  
'Cause we're gonna go out tonight.  
We're gonna bask in the electric glow  
Of a billion little colored lights.  
We've got a lot to do, before the dawn  
So with a minimum of introspection,  
I think you've better put your mittens on  
Shake your jingle bell in my direction  
  
Sometimes I feel like a big snowman  
That's fallen under a plow.  
But tonight I'm on top of the world  
We're gonna bring it around somehow.  
  
Christmas is starting now!  
Oh yeah!  
Christmas is starting now.  
That's right, Christmas is starting now.  
Oh yeah.
