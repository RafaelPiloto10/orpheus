I don't understand why I'm crazy  
Over you, I don't know what to do,  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
  
If I had to,  
I would give up everything just to feel and be with you,  
If I had to,  
I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you,  
If I had to,  
I would give my very last breath just to help save you,  
If I had to,  
I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
Only you,  
  
If I had to  
I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you,  
If I had to,  
I would die all alone, if living meant without you,  
If I had to,  
I would go through all the pain again, just to find you,  
If I had to,  
I'd surrender all my love, just because I love you,  
  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I wanna run to you, breathe as one with you,  
Absent in time without you, existing only for you,  
Every dream is of you, only turn to you,  
Baby, my love,  
Only for you,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I'm gonna ride for you ooh,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
Only you  
I'd ride for you  
Cuz ur the truth  
I'd die for you  
Oh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you  
And I'd do anything that pleases you  
Yeaaahh...
