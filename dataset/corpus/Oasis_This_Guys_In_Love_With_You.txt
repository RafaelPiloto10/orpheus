You see this guy,  
This guy's in love with you  
Yes I'm in love,  
I love you the way I do  
When you smile I can tell  
We know each other very well,  
How can I show you?  
I plan, I got to know you cos  
  
I heard some talk,  
They say you think I'm fine  
Yes, I'm in love,  
And what I do to make you mine  
  
Tell me now, is it so,  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
My hands are shaking,  
Don't let my heart keep breaking cos  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say you're in love, in love, with this guy  
If not I'll just die  
  
Tell me now, is it so,  
Don't let me be the last to know,  
  
My hands are shaking,  
Don't let my heart keep breaking cos  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say you're in love, in love, with this guy  
If not I'll just die
