I'm just saying  
I want my mummy back  
Lost her to the drink  
But her soul's intact  
Mama said to me  
Be proud of who you are  
She saw Jesus in the eyes  
Of a broken man  
  
Sail away  
I am learning my lesson  
Mama sends her love  
And Godspeed you come home soon  
  
One little white lie was enough  
To conceal my goodbye  
Then I stole away  
Kissed her farewell  
And wished her the best for life  
Then I stole away, whoa  
Like a thief in the night  
  
I'm just saying  
Not behind daddy's back  
He takes care of her  
In his overtime  
He's no saint I know  
As he goes around the town  
Watch him cry himself to sleep  
He's my daddy  
  
Sail away  
I will go it alone now  
Leave my past behind  
To seek fortune and fame  
  
One little white lie was enough  
To conceal my goodbye  
Then I stole away  
Kissed her farewell  
And wished her the best for life  
Then I stole away, whoa  
Like a thief in the night  
  
Sail away  
There's a storm in a teacup  
Mama sends her love  
And Godspeed you come home  
  
One little white lie was enough  
To conceal my goodbye  
Then I stole away  
Kissed her farewell  
And wished her the best for life  
Then I stole away, whoa  
Like a thief in the night  
  
One little white lie was enough  
To conceal my goodbye  
Then I stole away  
Like a prodigal son  
And wished her the best for life  
Then I stole away, whoa  
Like a thief in the night
