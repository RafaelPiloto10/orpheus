Where you gonna run  
Where you gonna hide  
Who you tryin to see  
What you tryin to find  
CHORUS  
We're all in this race  
Everybody trying to keep a pace  
Can't get away  
No no, there is no escape  
The world is faced with problems  
And many illusions  
Love is the man overstanding  
It's the only solution  
CHORUS  
People walking around in disguise  
Try to tell me what they're trying to hide  
'Cause what you're looking for  
It stay here with you all the time  
The world is faced with problems  
And many illusions  
Love is the man overstanding  
It's the only solution  
CHORUS
