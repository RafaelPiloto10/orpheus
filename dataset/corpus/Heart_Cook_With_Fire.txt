This hot night wind is mine, I know  
This gust of love ain't no liar  
Steamed up, blown up, stoked from below  
I'm a ready to cook with fire  
  
She cattin' around to catch you, man  
And butters you up to buy her  
Darling, she's just a flash in the pan.  
Don't you want to cook with fire?  
  
I'm talkin' 'bout kickin' the role  
I want to give you whole thing  
Yes, she gonna burn ya  
She gonna make you a fool  
But it'll learn ya  
Way, way better than school  
That I got a soul that's got a spark  
Oh, yeah, holdin' a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord, we gonna cook it with fire  
  
That I got a soul that's got a spark  
Oh, yeah, holdin' a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord, we gonna cook it with fire  
  
Cookin' with fire, fire, fire
