[Verse]  
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you  
You got something that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?  
Changing your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you don't have the time to wait on me  
  
[Hook]  
I try with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you  
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it  
World's, world's, world's famous  
World's, world's, world's famous  
  
[Post-Hook]  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say  
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
Maybe we just should have did things my way  
Instead of the other way  
  
[Hook]  
I tried with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you  
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it  
World's, world's, world's famous  
World's, world's, world's famous  
  
[Post-Hook]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say
