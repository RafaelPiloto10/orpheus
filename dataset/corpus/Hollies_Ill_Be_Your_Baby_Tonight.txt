Close your eyes, close the door  
You don't have to worry anymore  
I'll be your little baby tonight  
Shut the light, shut the shade  
You don't have to be afraid  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Well the mockingbird's gonna sail away  
You won't regret it  
The big fine moon's gonna shine like a spoon  
You won't regret, you won't forget  
To get your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Well the mockingbird's gonna sail away  
You won't regret it  
The big fine moon's gonna shine like a spoon  
You won't regret, you won't forget  
To get your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight  
I'll be your baby tonight
