Oh how she tried to cut him down to size  
Telling dirty lies to his friends  
But his own father said give her up, don't bother  
The world isn't coming to and end, he said...  
"Walk like a man, talk like a man my son  
No woman's worth crawling on the earth so walk like a man my son"  
  
Bye baby, I don't mean maybe  
Gonna get along somehow  
Soon she'll be crying on account of all her lying  
Oh yeah just look who's laughing now. He's gonna...  
Walk like a man, fast as he can, walk like a man from you  
He'll tell the world "Forget about it girl, I'd walk like a man from you."  
  
Oh how she tried to cut him down to size  
Telling dirty lies to his friends  
But his own father said give her up, don't bother  
The world isn't coming to and end, he said...  
Walk like a man, talk like a man my son  
No woman's worth crawling on the earth so walk like a man my son
