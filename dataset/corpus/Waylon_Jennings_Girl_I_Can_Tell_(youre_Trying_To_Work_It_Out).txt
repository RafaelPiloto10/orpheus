Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out  
Tryin' to get a handle on what life is all about  
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes tryin' to find the truth in lovers lies  
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out  
Girl I can see you're wantin' to give it a try  
Taking all the good and the bad the truth and the lies  
Feelings inside you you can't talk about feelings have a way of not comin' out  
Girl I can see you're trying to work it out  
[ guitar ]  
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes looking for the truth in lovers lies  
And the ties that bind the things that last through time  
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out
