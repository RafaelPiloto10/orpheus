You say your heart has been broken  
And it's taking forever to mend  
And it's left you even more certain  
That you'll never love again  
A long time ago someone told me  
It's not love that causes the pain  
Whenever a heart has been shattered  
It's the losing of love that's to blame  
  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
It's not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
  
I know your feelings are tender  
And you're so afraid they won't heal  
I'll prove to you love doesn't hurt you  
And I'll show you how true love should feel  
  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
It's not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyone's heart
