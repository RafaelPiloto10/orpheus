You tell lies thinking I can't see  
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me  
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
  
Man buys ring, woman throws it away  
Same old thing happen every day  
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
  
We're all alone and there's nobody else  
She'll still moan "Keep your hands to yourself"  
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down, woo  
  
A baby you know I'm down  
I guess I'm down  
I'm down on the ground  
I'm down  
Ah, baby I'm upside down  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
I'm down
