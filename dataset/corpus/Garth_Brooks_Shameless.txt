Well I'm shameless  
When it comes to loving you,  
I'll do anything you want me to,  
I'll do anything at all.  
  
And I'm standing  
Here for all the world to see,  
Oh, baby that's what's left of me,  
I don't have very far to fall.  
  
You know now I'm not a man who's ever been  
Insecure about the world I've been living in.  
I don't break easy, I have my pride,  
But if you need to be satisfied  
  
I'm shameless.  
Honey, I don't have a prayer.  
Every time I see you standing there  
I go down upon my knees.  
  
And I'm changing,  
Swore I'd never compromise,  
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise.  
I'll do anything you need.  
  
You see in all my life I've never found  
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down.  
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,  
But I can't walk away from you.  
  
I have never had anything have this much control on me.  
I've worked too hard to call my life my own.  
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,  
But it sure won't now, I can't refuse,  
I've never had so much to lose.  
And I'm shameless...  
  
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong  
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong.  
I've never lost anything I ever missed,  
But I've never been in love like this.  
It's out of my hands.  
  
I'm shameless.  
I don't have the power now,  
And I don't want it anyhow,  
So I gotta let it go.  
  
And I'm shameless.  
Shameless as a man can be.  
You could make a total fool of me.  
I just wanted you to know  
That I'm shameless.
