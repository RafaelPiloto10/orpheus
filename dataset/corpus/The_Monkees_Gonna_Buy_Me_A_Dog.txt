You know my girl just called me up  
And she woke me from my sleep  
You should have heard the things she said  
You know she hurt my feelings deep.  
I'm gonna buy me a dog [A dog, a dog! Why?]  
'Cause I need a friend now. [Say, you need all the friends you can get]  
I'm gonna buy me a dog,  
My girl, my girl, don't love me no how.  
  
She used to bring me my newspaper  
'Cause she knew where it was at.  
She used to keep me so contented.  
But I can teach a dog to do that.  
I'm gonna buy me a dog,  
'Cause I need a friend now  
I'm gonna buy me a dog,  
My girl, my girl, don't love me no how.
