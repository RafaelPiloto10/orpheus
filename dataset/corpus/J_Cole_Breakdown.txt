Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it  
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute  
And when I say a minute I mean years man  
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam  
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days  
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played  
Father, cause no other man bothered  
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical  
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better  
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater  
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta  
So many things you could have told me  
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me  
I feel like you barely know me  
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same  
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same  
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame  
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth  
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me  
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury  
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish  
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it  
  
I break down, I break down  
Can't help but break down  
I break down  
  
I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man  
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn  
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool  
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?  
Quicksand is what this life feel like  
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life  
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right  
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like  
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas  
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas  
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas  
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas  
  
Break down!  
We break down, we break down, we break down  
  
Servin' time, locked down  
And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter twenty five pounds  
By the time he get out, she gon' be four  
Now will his girl stay down?  
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho  
But temptation stays round  
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?  
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend  
A little freakin', but them niggas holla  
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'  
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons  
Damn! She do the best that she can  
Her mama tellin' her to find another man  
She college educated with a felon boyfriend  
That's what she thinkin' tonight  
Maybe she's right, but please  
  
Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!  
Please, stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!  
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down  
  
Break, break down  
Steady break me down  
Steady break me down
