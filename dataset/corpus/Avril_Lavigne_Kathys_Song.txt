[Verse:]  
When I heard that you'd died  
I was stabbed inside  
I'll never be the same again  
I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend  
Even though I never knew you  
From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you  
And your life lost, so young, so new  
And you never realised  
That so many would lose their sleep tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
So don't tell me  
Not to cry  
'cause I'm hurting  
Inside, outside  
Young girl, you're to young to die  
I heard your ambition's high  
Now look me in the eye  
And tell me that I shouldn't cry  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I was there from the start  
When I heard, I gave my heart  
I can't connect how I feel  
With what happened, or what's real  
You felt the fear and then the blow  
You couldn't say goodbye before you go  
I can't sweep aside what I feel  
I can't sweep aside, it's so real  
The cruel world let you die  
So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry  
I was choked up inside  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm feeling like I've got no right  
When there's others who won't sleep for nights  
I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way  
But I can't hold it back another day  
These tears, this song's for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To let you know I care  
But a stab to my heart unprepared  
Left me feeling outta life  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
  
Every time I read those words  
My heart gives in  
I'll never get over it  
It won't kick in  
That you're gone  
I'm sorry that you're gone
