Get the lead on out 'cause it's my round  
And I punched the van 'cause I lost the sound  
And then I fell on down, oh yeah  
I ain't old enough to have walked the line  
But I've circled this room for the twenty fifth time  
  
For a fortunate son I'm such a jealous guy  
Got a bone to pick I dunno why  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
  
What I gave away and what I left behind  
Swallowed history like a five an' dine  
And then I fell on down oh yeah  
Y'all knew the guy he was the king of the kids  
Threw his trophies to the sky as he jumped from the bridge yeah  
  
For a fortunate son I'm such a jealous guy  
Got a bone to pick I dunno why  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
  
And if you're looking for the guy who can see  
With some of these damn apologies  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
Hey hey your foot down  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
Hey hey get on up  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Oh yeah  
What would I do?
