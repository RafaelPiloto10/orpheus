You'll take my life but I'll take yours too  
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through  
So when you're waiting for the next attack  
You'd better stand there's no turning back  
  
The bugle sounds as the charge begins  
But on this battlefield no one wins  
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath  
As you plunge into a certain death  
  
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run  
The mighty roar of the Russian guns  
And as we race towards human wall  
The screams of pain as my comrades fall  
  
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground  
And as the Russians fire another round  
We get so near yet so far away  
We won't live to fight another day  
  
We get so close near enough to fight  
When a Russian gets me in his sights  
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow  
A burst of rounds takes my horse below  
  
And as I lay there gazing at the sky  
My body's numb and my throat is dry  
And as I lay forgotten and alone  
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
