She reminds me of the one in school  
When I was cuttin'  
She was dressed in white  
And I couldn't take my eyes off her  
But that's not what I took off that night  
  
She'll never cover up what we did with her dress, no  
She said kiss me  
It'll heal  
But it won't forget  
Kiss me  
It'll heal  
But it won't forget  
  
And I don't mind you keepin' me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
  
She reminds me of a one I knew  
That cut up the negatives of my life  
I couldn't take my hands off her  
She wouldn't let me be anywhere but inside  
  
And I don't mind you keepin' me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Just don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
  
She'll never cover up what we did with her dress, no  
She said kiss me  
It'll heal  
But it won't forget  
Kiss me  
It'll heal  
But it won't forget  
  
I don't mind you keepin' me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Don't break  
Don't break my heart  
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses  
Little girl, little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low
