A will we ever understand?  
Or is the fate of man at hand?  
Or will we live or shall we die?  
  
How will we ever know if we never try?  
The government's the Devil's hands  
It's a lie and it's a scam  
  
They wind us up, put us down  
And watch us go  
And if you close your eyes  
There's a big surprise  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we feel what we dream about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
I've been lost in the name of love  
And we kill our brothers daily  
In the name of God  
  
We'd better chill before  
We take on some tribulation  
And if we realized  
And then we'll make a little love now sing  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we believe what we read about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we believe what we dream about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light
