Ain't got the change of a nickel  
Ain't got no bounce in my shoes  
Ain't go no fancy to tickle  
  
I ain't got nothing but the blues  
Ain't got no coffee that's perking  
Ain't got no winnings to lose  
  
Ain't got a dream that is working  
I ain't got nothing but the blues  
When trumpets flare up  
  
I keep my hair up  
I just can't make it come down  
Believe me peppie,  
I can't get happy  
  
Since my ever loving baby left town  
Ain't got no rest in my slumbers  
Ain't got no feelings to bruise  
Ain't got no telephone numbers  
I ain't got nothing but the blues
