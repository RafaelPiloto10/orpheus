Turn me up in the headphones  
  
Been alotta cheap talk but I rock still  
From the streets of Shanghai back to Knoxville  
Sittin' high on a mountain top holdin' shop spreadin' the good news  
Been alotta false prophets and quick hits  
And a lot of unAmerican bullshit  
But the time has come to settle and the devil's gonna make u choose  
  
And just like a cold wind blowin' can u feel me comin' for u  
Just like a freight train rollin' packed tight full of rhythm and blues  
  
Testify  
It's a Rock revival  
Don't need a suit  
Ya don't need a bible  
Get up and dance  
I'm gonna set you free yeah  
Testify  
It's all sex, drugs, rock n roll  
A soul sensation that you can't control  
And you can see I practice what I preach  
I'm your rock n roll Jesus  
Yes I am  
  
Been alotta bling bling but it ain't real  
And alotta new kings but I won't kneel  
Sittin' high on a mountain top, holdin' shop singin' the raw dog blues  
Like in old Mississippi's dirty cotton fields  
Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels  
It's the same song spinning but the same song's always been true  
  
And I'm gonna take my roll cuz I ain't got nothin' to lose  
And I'm gonna save your soul if it's really what you want me to do  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Get on your knees  
  
I'm your rock n roll Jesus
