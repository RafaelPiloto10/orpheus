Hey yo Puff, check this out pa  
I'm tired of niggas hating on a mutha fucka  
Let's take it to the next millennium on these bitches  
You got to keep bubblin on em  
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas  
Hey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like,  
"Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice"  
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice  
You public enemy number one right now  
But Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit  
  
Let's go  
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear  
Throw your guns in the air  
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way  
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see  
But you wanna be you ain't shit to me  
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me  
Playa, my real dogs they'll spit for me  
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart  
I've seen em come and I've seen em part  
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?  
Front from the light catch shots after dark  
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these  
On the spot, red dots make em all believe  
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these  
See I do the things that they can't achieve  
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing  
Bets on that you'll be disgracing  
More hotter than the sun  
I'm living on the run  
Because i'm public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
Let me ask you, what you got against me?  
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?  
Is it my house or maybe its all three  
I just came up and you're all against me  
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?  
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?  
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?  
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one  
Always with God and I don't swing solo  
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo  
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though  
Pretty young things wanna have my photo  
One in the room hangin' on the wall  
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all  
Got no time for those that think small  
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball  
Hate shot callers  
Hate them ballers  
Back in control now I call orders  
It's no fun fleeing under the gun  
Cause they got me public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers  
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire  
I spit lines, hit rhymes  
Keep dimes sweating  
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'  
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor  
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer  
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor  
Before you try me, you better say your prayers  
My word to the wise is: "Do not cry"  
You know that i'm gone then say don't die  
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme  
Thought it was over but I crept from behind  
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind  
Almost 2000 and running out of time  
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines  
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine  
Soldiers in position all on the front line  
Don't make a move till I give them the sign  
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son  
Because i'm public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff  
That's what I'm talkin about love  
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers  
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches  
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got  
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down  
But fuck dat, they just mad  
Cause you got all the ladies  
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys  
You know? and thats just the way the story goes  
And thats just the way the story goes  
Fuck you niggas and hoes  
  
You think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?  
Haha picture that....number one, number one, number one  
B-I-G forever... rock on
