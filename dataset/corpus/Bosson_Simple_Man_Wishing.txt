I get up, to get a real bite of life  
A slice of love, no goodbyes  
Still keeps me satisfied  
I wanna hold on to that feeling  
When you're not sure if your dreaming  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
I get up, to see the sun set again  
Wishing that it never ends  
Watching lovers turn to friends  
I wanna feel like believing  
Knowing you, gave me a meaning  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
In a world where everything remains in shadows  
The only ray of light is knowing that  
You'll be by my side  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you
