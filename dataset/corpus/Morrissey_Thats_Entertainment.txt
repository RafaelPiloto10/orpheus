Police car with a screaming siren  
Pneumatic drill on ripped-up concrete  
Baby wails, a stray dog howling  
Brakes screech as lamp light blinking  
  
That's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
  
Smash of glass and a rumble of boots  
Electric train and a ripped up phone booth  
A hot day and a sticky black tarmac  
A hot day and I'm wishing I was far away  
  
That's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
  
Days of speed and a slow time Mondays  
Wake up at six am and think about your holidays  
Open window and breathe in petrol  
Cold flat with damp on the walls  
  
Yes, that's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
  
Two lovers kissing over screams of midnight  
Two lovers miss the tranquility of solitude  
Read graffiti of slash-seat affairs  
Splattered walls and a kick in the balls  
  
Is all that you get - in the name of entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la...
