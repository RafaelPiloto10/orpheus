The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missing such a lot that could be yours  
  
Why can't I stop forgetting myself?  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else  
Why can't I love you?  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours  
  
And who's going to miss me?  
There'll only be myself to blame  
You know I'd love to hold you tight  
And love you all the night  
But I don't even know my name  
  
La la la da la  
  
Why can't I stop forgetting myself?  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else?  
Why can't I love you?  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours
