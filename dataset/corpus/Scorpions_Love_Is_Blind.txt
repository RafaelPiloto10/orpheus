Close my eyes  
Didn't want to see  
Believe the lies  
You said to me  
  
She played a game  
I played along  
But now I know  
I was not the only one  
  
She treated me  
Just like a fool  
I was in love you  
Share my soul  
  
The way you touched  
I never knew before  
Can't ask you out  
Don't close the door  
  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
By my side  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Don't you know  
It's a state of mind  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is blind, baby  
  
Didn't know  
But you never life  
But something told me  
I was right inside  
  
Things you said  
They felt so good  
They ask your brain was  
Oh was so cute  
  
But then I got  
Behind the scene  
I want to go  
But I can't leave  
  
The way you touched  
I never knew before  
Can't ask you out now  
Don't close the door  
  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
By my side  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Don't you know  
It's a state of mind  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is blind, baby  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is  
Love is blind
