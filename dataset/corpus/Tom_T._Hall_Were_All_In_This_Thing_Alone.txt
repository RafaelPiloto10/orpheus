(Hey there) you know she left me (hey there) I've been crying  
In a boat on a plane in a train in a house by the phone  
(Hey there) we're all in this thing alone  
You can't smile for me I can't cry for you we can't be alone together that
makes two  
Like trees that fall in forest no one hears crying done alone don't call for
tears  
(Hey there) you know she left me...  
  
Ain't it strange how we think money knows when Friday comes  
Calls don't know bout Sunday and our heartaches twice as done  
It hurts although it's killed you thorugh and through  
My eyes all red from tears aren't really blue  
(Hey there) you know she left me...
