Um, can you make it  
So can you make it  
Are you something special  
  
Some stupid a things say they thrill a lot of my life  
Like the feeling that I want to get to know you better  
Say If you're in my heart  
Say I could and I would  
And you might and you shouldn't  
No I can't go on  
Thinking this love isn't strong  
This love isn't strong  
Till I seek those words of wisdom  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of  
You gotta learn  
  
You may wear your heart upon your sleeve  
But vicious lies they only tease tease  
Every eye open is not seeing  
Every eyes closed  
  
Say If you're in my heart  
Say I could and I would  
And you might and you shouldn't  
No I can't go on, thinking this love isn't strong  
This love isn't strong  
Till I seek those words of wisdom  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those words  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of  
She said you gotta learn, gotta learn baby  
You got to learn  
  
C'mon baby  
  
'Cause I seek those words of wisdom (I seek those words of wisdom)  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those words  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
  
She said, I shall sing a sad sad song  
I shall sing a sad sad song  
Had many lovers in my day  
Just like the wind they've all blown away  
Say I've had many lovers in my day  
Just like the wind they've all blown away  
  
Say if your girl  
Say if your girl  
  
(I seek those words)  
(I seek those words of wisdom)  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Until I seek those words of wisdom
