I met a man who felt the same way,  
That the world had passed him by.  
Told to me all his troubles,  
That the world had made him cry.  
  
Life had kept him waiting,  
Regretting his pain inside.  
Had to feel underrated,  
And hated, besides.  
  
Life had kept him waiting,  
Regretting his shame inside.  
Had to feel underrated,  
And hated, besides.  
  
Sometime world, pass me by again,  
Carry you, carry me, away.  
Sometime world, pass me by again,  
Carry you, carry me, away.
