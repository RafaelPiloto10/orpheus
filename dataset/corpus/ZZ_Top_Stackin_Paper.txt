Stackin' Paper  
Cheese and huevos  
Gimmie 'nother million dollars  
Another million  
  
Stackin' Paper  
My money maker  
I'm ready and I'm willin'  
Just stack a billion  
  
Listen, buddy brother  
'Cause sister got to have it too  
Hey, hey, hey, now.  
I hit it in Reno  
  
Then in Monte Carlo  
I can hit it everywhere!  
Loaded and truckin'  
  
If you're shy, just fuck it  
If I'm smellin' green  
Then I don't care  
  
Listen, buddy brother  
'Cause sister got to have it too  
Hey, hey, hey, now.  
Stackin' the Paper Baby
