[Intro]  
Back to back to back to back  
At your bitch ass (uh)  
  
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa](2x)  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Woke up drunk as fuck  
Still high from yesterday  
I'm trying to make a play  
I'm trying to make a play  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
Woke up feeling like a star  
Get it in no matter where we are  
She in love with me press buttons up in my car  
My weed smoke hella potent  
Riding and the sunroof open  
Blowing smoke out what they know about  
Being bosses, taking losses  
Pay the cost to fuck that bitch, who got that poke out  
My money ain't slow, got more trees to roll  
Got a son I love to death, I gotta see him grow  
Probably the best you've seen but I be on the low  
Stacking up, rolling marijuana, acting up  
Bitch with me, she be bad as fuck  
Bitches love it, niggas mad at us  
Getting money, that's accurate  
Say they want it but they can't adjust  
Taylor Gang, roll a plane  
  
[Hook](2x)  
  
[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]  
Who trying to pour it(ay, ay)  
Who trying to wake and bake(ay)  
Taylor Gang will break the bank  
Ain't got no time to contemplate  
I say i'm high from yesterday  
Okay i woke up on the mud  
I think i ate a 8th of shrums  
Keep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)  
Your hoe will come with us(ay)  
Cause she know we brought the drugs(ay)  
And she looking for some love(ay)  
But let's keep that on the hush(whoa)  
It's hard to find some trust  
Some say it's hard to fuck with us  
That's cause we be on different shit  
Bitch i might pour six up in my Crush  
Ohh that's super super much  
And it's joining super clutch  
Got 5 more just for you to stuff  
Send parents to the store for ice and cups  
I swear they never frighten us  
Hell yeah we always lighting up  
Put that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch  
And i pour another 8th to level up  
Probably rolling up
