You've got me achin' more than I should  
My heart is breakin', oh don't it feel good  
'Cause I know for certain, we're magic in love  
You've got me hurtin, 'cause I can't get enough  
  
I just couldn't say no even though I should  
Even if I did, wonder if you could  
I just couldn't say no when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best  
  
The way you tease me makes me want you more  
You purr like a kitten but I hear you roar  
Your body language is talkin' to me  
Right here in the darkness, it's so plain to see  
  
I just couldn't say no even though I should  
Even if I did, wonder if you could  
I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best, I just couldn't say no  
  
I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best  
I just couldn't say no, I've tried my best  
  
I just couldn't say no
