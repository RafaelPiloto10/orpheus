I was scrapin' bottom  
Gropin' in the dark  
It takes a crusty punk to really beat  
The mean streets of Medicine Park  
So I shifted left for out of town  
Then I clicked my heels and I doubled down to  
  
Blues Beach  
I'm frying  
Sizzlin' in the merciful rays  
And it's the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned  
  
I went to Central Station  
To catch that early bus  
They were gassed and runnin' every which way  
But unhappily not for us  
Here comes Trina, the child bride  
I said hey pretty girl, can I cop a ride to  
  
Blues Beach  
It's rainin'  
I'm chillin' at the Manatee Bar  
Well it's a stone soul picnic  
For the early resigned  
  
We could rent a paranymphic glider  
My hypothetical friend  
And we could sail  
'Til the bending end  
  
Grab Big Dog a blanket  
Angel of my heart  
Things may get a whole lot worse  
Before suddenly falling apart  
Give your roommate Yvonne a ring  
Cause if she still wants in I gotta pull some strings  
  
On Blues Beach  
I'm dying  
Freezin' in the merciful rays  
And it's the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned
