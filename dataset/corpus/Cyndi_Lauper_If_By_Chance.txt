It might just be too deep  
We've turned your love into a hate  
I can't wake you from this sleep  
I can't lure you with this bait  
And when you're all alone at night  
I feel for you, I fight the fight  
I need to know that where you go  
Is real enough for me to know  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
It might just be too late  
We've turned your heart into a stone  
I can't save you from this fate  
I can't help you be alone  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
Blood is thicker than water  
That could be a bunch of lies  
What makes me think I ought to  
Hold reins on all the ties  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?
