The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
The sky was never blue  
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
And I never cared for you  
  
I know you won't believe these things I tell you  
No, you won't believe  
Your heart has been forewarned  
All men will lie to you  
Your mind cannot conceive  
Now all depends on what I say to you  
And on your doubting me  
So I've prepared these statements far from true  
Pay heed and disbelieve  
  
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
The sky was never blue  
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
And I never cared for you
