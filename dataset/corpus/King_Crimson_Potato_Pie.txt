Someday you're gonna wake up singing  
Someday you're gonna wake up tired  
It makes you feel like a horseshoe  
In a swimming pool  
Cause you know you don't belong  
I move left  
You move right  
I'm like a blind man on a motorbike  
You say potato  
But I say pie  
Tell me why  
Someday you'll be sorry  
Someday sad  
Someday you might even wake up  
Just a little bit mad  
Maybe tomorrow  
Might be tonight  
But in the meantime.  
I was hoping you might  
Solve this puzzle of mine  
Someday
