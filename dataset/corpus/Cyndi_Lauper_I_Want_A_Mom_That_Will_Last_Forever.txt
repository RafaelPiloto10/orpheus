I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom to make it all better  
I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom who love me whatever  
  
I want a mom to take my hand  
and make me feel like a holiday  
A mom to tuck me in at night  
And chase the monsters away  
I want a mom to read me stories  
and sing a lullaby  
And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry  
  
Oh, I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom to make it all better  
I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom that will love me whatever, forever  
  
And when she says to me that she'll always be there  
To watch and protect me, I don't have to be scared  
O, and when she says I will always love you,  
I want need to worry cause i'll know that it's true  
  
I want a mom when I get lonely, to take the time to play  
A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it gray  
I want a mom to read me stories and sing a lullaby  
And if I find a bad dream, to hold me when I cry  
  
Chorus (repeat twice)  
I want a mom  
I want a mom  
I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom  
I want a mom  
I want a mom that will last forever  
I want a mom  
I want a mom that will last forever
