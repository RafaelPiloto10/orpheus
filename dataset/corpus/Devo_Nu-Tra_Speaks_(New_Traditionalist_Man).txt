Greetings beautiful mutants  
And how may we be of service?  
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated  
Checking in with the many factions  
  
Of devolutionary humans  
Who have waited so faithfully this past year  
While Devo gathered its strength  
For the next offensive  
  
As many of you can see  
The road ahead is filled with danger  
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear  
But the human mind itself  
  
Or lack of it on this planet  
It's time to go beyond the normal thing  
It's time to do the super thing  
It's time for Devo  
  
There is no question about it  
The spud boys are ready with  
New songs, new films and new approaches  
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans  
  
Lies, lies, lies  
That's all we get  
From those who pretend to know but don't  
But once again Devo attempts  
  
To cut through the mental grease and grime  
With techniques of positive mutation  
Designed to protect you  
From the ninnies and the twits  
  
Remember, no one knows  
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions  
That help point us all in the right direction  
To go forward, move ahead  
  
And give the past the slip  
It's time to seek out new traditions  
We know where the old one's took us  
And now we are all here together  
  
So let's go take in the full measure  
Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit  
The vinyl record and cassette tape  
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings  
  
Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'  
To purchase, it is not like spending money  
But rather, it is an investment in the future  
In a blow against the empire  
  
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated saying  
'Bombs away'
