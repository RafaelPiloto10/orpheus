Streets are full of rain  
Lightning cracks the sky  
Hear a lonely cry, eyes full of pain  
  
Searchin' in the darkness  
Eyes pierce the night  
Calling for her young one  
As she walks towards the light  
  
It's the night of the wolf  
Hear the cry of the wolf  
  
Streets paved with gold  
Night gives out a warning  
There's thunder in her heart  
And mother wolf is calling  
  
Searchin' in the shadows  
For the one she must save  
She cries out a prayer  
Like a song from beyond the grave  
  
The bells will toll  
No one will sleep tonight  
While she alone will  
Walk the streets tonight  
  
Sun begins to rise  
All the streets washed with rain  
Still hear her cries  
Eyes burnt with pain  
  
Returning to the twilight  
Betrayed by the night  
Screaming for her young one  
As she walks towards the light
