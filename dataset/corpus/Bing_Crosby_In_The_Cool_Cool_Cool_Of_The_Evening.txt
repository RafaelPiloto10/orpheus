In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Save your pappy a chair  
  
When the party's getting a glow on  
And singin' fills the air  
In the shank of the night  
When the doin's are right  
  
Well you can tell em I'll be there  
I like a barbecue  
I like to boil a ham  
And I vote for bola baste stew  
  
What's that?  
I like a weenie bake, steak and a layer cake  
And you'll get a tummy ache too  
We'll rent a tent or a teepee  
  
Let the town crier cry  
"All's well!"  
And if it's RSVP  
This is what I'll reply  
  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em we'll be there  
If you need a pair of freeloaders  
To fracture your affair  
  
I may even give them Pagliacci  
Now stand back and give him air  
If one can relax and we'll have a few yaks  
And you can tell them we'll be there  
  
"Oui," said the bumblebee  
"Let's have jubilee."  
"When?" said the prairie hen, "Soon?"  
"Sure," said the dinosaur  
  
"Where?" said the grisly bear  
"Under the light of the moon."  
"How about your brother, jackass?"  
Everyone gaily cried  
  
"Are you coming to the fracas?"  
Ain't gonna blow it  
"And all the respects," he sighed  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Stick 'em on my hair  
If perchance we look a bit peeked  
  
Remember se la guerre  
If we're still on our feet  
And there's something to eat  
Well you can tell them we'll be there  
  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Better save a chair  
  
When the party's getting a glow on  
And singin' fills the air  
If there's gas in my hack  
And my laundry is back  
  
If there's room for one more  
And you need me  
Why sure  
If you need a new face or a tenor or base  
  
If I can climb out of bed and put a head on my head  
Well you can tell 'em we'll be there.
