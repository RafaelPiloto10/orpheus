When the day is dawning  
On a Texas Sunday morning,  
How I long to be there  
With Marie whos waitin for me there.  
Every lonely city  
Where I hang my hat,  
Aint as half as pretty  
As where my babys at.  
Is this the way to Amarillo?  
Every night I've been hugging my pillow  
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo  
And sweet Marie who waits for me.  
Show me the way to Amarillo  
I've been weepin like a willow  
Crying over Amarillo  
And sweet Marie who waits for me.  
Sha la la la la la la la  
And Marie who waits for me.  
There's a church bell ringing,  
Hear the sound of joy that it's singing  
For the sweet Maria  
And the guy whos comin to see her.  
Just beyond the highway  
Lies an open plain  
And it keeps me going  
Through the wind and rain.  
Is this the way to Amarillo?.............
