Pictures of an image of a person who could not be blamed  
You are a colour and you are a number  
We need a sanction to see one another  
If I keep my distance in the season of this slender hell  
It's because of the need to live off one another  
Go home young offender and stay undercover  
  
We're busy running out of time  
(Whatever it takes, I will make you mine)  
I'll take the future from your hands  
(All the things I've ever had, I can make the perfect crime)  
  
We're strong, we do our thing  
Let the world cry, watch the birds sing  
Give me the freedom, I need to recover  
Words cannot heal, when a line is your lover  
  
Wind howls in my chamber like an angel  
(like an angel)  
You are a colour and you are a number  
Go home young offender and stay undercover
