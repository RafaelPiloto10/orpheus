It must have been moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
It must have been moonglow  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you saying  
"Dear one, hold me fast"  
And I start in praying  
Oh Lord, please let this last  
  
We seemed to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where  
And now when there's moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember that moonglow gave me you  
  
It must have been moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
It must have been moonglow  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you saying  
"Dear one, hold me fast"  
And I start in praying  
Oh Lord, please let this last  
  
We seemed to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where  
And now when there's moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember that moonglow brought me you
