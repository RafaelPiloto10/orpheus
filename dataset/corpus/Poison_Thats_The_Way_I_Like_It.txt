Well it's boy meets girl and it starts a fire  
Two hearts burn in pure desire  
A candle burns the midnight oil  
Lust to love and raise the spoil  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Can't fight the lust  
Can't find the truth  
Ain't nothing you can do  
When the girl goes down  
  
Hollywood and Vine on the hundredth floor  
All the lies in bed, couldn't take it no more  
Now standing on the ledge and faces truth  
As she ate 'em up spit 'em out, his time is through  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Misery loves company  
Nothing you can do  
When the girl goes down  
  
Solo  
  
I woke up this morning in the paper read  
The Hollywood Police found a young man dead  
No name, no face, or known I'd  
Just no different than you and me  
  
Now someone arrives in her strange world  
And the story goes it's boy meets girl  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Can't fight the lust  
Can't find the truth  
Ain't nothing you can do
