If you've got something to say  
Why don't you say it  
If you've got something to give  
Why don't you give it to me  
Day after day I have to say it  
We're moving further from heaven  
And closer to the deep blue sea  
  
Cause I have no secrets from you  
And I have nothing left to hide  
And I'm open to all of your questions  
Why can't you reach inside  
Like I have  
Like I have for you  
  
And all these games that you play  
Don't tell me how a man should be  
Some would say if you knew  
You wouldn't be here with me  
I Love you  
I still love you  
But I guess it's time to let you be  
  
Cause I have no secrets from you  
And I have nothing left to hide  
and I'm so tired of all these questions  
Cause maybe you just changed your mind  
Like I have  
Like I have  
Like I have  
Like I have  
  
When I was at your doorstep  
You told me to look around  
Said come in  
You and your heart sit down  
But you better watch your step  
Cause your not far from the ground  
And one fine day this all falls down  
Like I have  
Like I have  
  
If you got something to say  
Why don't you say it  
If you've got something to give  
Why don't you give it to me  
Day after day I have to say it  
If we've got something to save  
Why don't we save it
