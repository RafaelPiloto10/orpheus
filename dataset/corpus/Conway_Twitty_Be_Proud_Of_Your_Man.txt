Darling I love you can't you see so help me and love me all you can  
And if you love me then love me for what I am not what I should be  
Woman be proud of your man  
Walk with me not on me talk to me not about me  
Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man  
Laugh with me not at me look at me not through me  
Face me don't disgrace me be proud of your man  
  
Pull with me not against me see some good in the bad in me  
Be asure me don't destroy me be proud of your man  
Be behind me not above me hold me don't control me  
Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man woman be proud of your man
