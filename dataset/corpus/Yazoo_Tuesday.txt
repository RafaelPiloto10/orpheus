Woman of thirty seeing the sun  
Packed up her suitcase started to run  
Looking for someone looking for none  
Pack up and drive away  
  
It was her birthday Tuesday morning  
Realization gradually dawning  
A man in a gray suit whispered 'I'm calling'  
Pack up and drive away  
  
Woman of thirty, husband and kids chained like a dog she had to rid  
No point in coping off came the lid  
Pack up and drive away  
  
Three thousand miles of honesty dreaming  
Perfect imagery is a gleaming  
No more shattered clouds were deeming  
Pack up and drive away  
  
In her heart it wasn't easy  
Mumbled words and feeling dizzy  
Reasons fight against excuses driving slower she was losing  
Dream was stirring only dozing  
Eyelids awaken to the daydream  
Just an illusion broken sunshine  
Woman of thirty there's no choice  
I can't help our helpless voice
