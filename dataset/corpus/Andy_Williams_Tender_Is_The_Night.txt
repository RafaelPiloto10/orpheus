Tender is the night  
So tender is the night  
There's no one in the world  
Except the two of us  
  
Should tomorrow find us disenchanted  
We have shared the love that few have known  
Summers by the sea, a sailboat in Capri  
These memories shall be our very own  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night
