Oh, oh, oh, oh  
So back, I'm so bad, I'm so bad  
Can I be honest with you please?  
It's really hard for me to speak right now  
Girl, I been drinkin' all day  
It's been a long week  
Can't you tell by my face?  
I wanna lose myself between your legs  
I wanna make your body shake  
Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase  
I promise you'll have nothing to say  
Cause at least I deserve this no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]  
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word  
I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word  
I'm just trying to lay you down without a word  
I'm just trying to get you high without a word  
I'm just trying to make you numb without a word  
I'm just trying to make you cum without a word  
I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word  
Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word  
  
Please, please, please  
Let me be the enemy  
  
I forgot how it feels to regret my sins  
I need that old thing back baby  
You can help me out baby  
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have  
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight  
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time  
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration  
We can put it in a song, if you want  
But at least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]  
  
I never fall for a girl like you  
I'll never understand what you're going through  
But your body poppin', your head game too  
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too  
Cause baby, I ain't perfect girl, I hope you knew  
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose  
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "what did I do?"  
You know what you did, all to blame is you  
Now the least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]
