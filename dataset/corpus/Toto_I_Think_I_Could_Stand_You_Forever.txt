Would you say no if I asked you for your hand  
Could you believe in the same words that I don't understand  
And would you cry if I told you I must go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've been waiting such a long, long time, I think I could stand you forever  
I've been wanting you a long, long time, I think I could stand you forever  
  
Would you say no if I asked you for this one chance  
Am I a fool to believe that this night is circumstance  
I wish that for once you could see the look in your own eyes  
  
I think I could stand you forever  
Think I could stand you, think I could stand you forever, yeah  
Think I could stand you forever, yeah - I think I could stand you  
Think I could stand you forever, yeah - forever and ever  
Think I could stand you forever, yeah  
Think I could stand you forever and ever and ever
