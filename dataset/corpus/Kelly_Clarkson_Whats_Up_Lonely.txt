Blue, I'm getting kinda close to you  
Like a shadow I can't lose  
Hey, you've been hangin' with me every day  
Now you're gettin' in my way  
I know you understand me  
But don't ya think that maybe it's time to move on  
  
[Chorus]  
What's up lonely  
Seems you're my only  
Friend who wants to share my pain  
Tell me heartache  
What's it gonna take  
For you to leave me alone today  
Just when I think that you're gone  
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me  
So what's up lonely  
  
Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side  
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I  
I want to leave this broken heart behind  
We been wastin' too much time  
Find someone else to rain on  
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to give you a reason  
To hang around anymore  
You won't be hurting my feelings  
If you find another broken heart you can lean on
