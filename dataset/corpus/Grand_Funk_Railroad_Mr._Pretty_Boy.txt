Hey, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
You sure been lookin' good. Yeah.  
Said, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
You lookin' like you should. Mmmmm ...  
Until you took the bottle and turned it up,  
You didn't want to quit 'til you drank up all of that stuff.  
Now, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Now you don't look so good. No, noooo ...  
  
Ahhhhhhh ... oh.  
Mr. Pretty Boy ....  
  
Sitting in the parlour,  
You entertain your guests. Mmmmm ...  
Mr. Pretty Boy ....  
That's what you do the best. That's what you do.  
Until you told the butler to bring another round,  
And no one else was drinkin' but you went and sucked them all down.  
Now, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Now you don't look so good. No ... you don't  
  
Ahhhhhhh ... oh.  
Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Ahhhhhhh ... oh.  
Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Mist ... Mr. Pretty Boy ...
