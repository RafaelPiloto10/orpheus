Once upon a time in a daymare  
Dying to meet you, litlle child, enter enter this sideshow  
  
Time for bed, the cradle still rocks  
Thirteen chimes on a dead man's clock  
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock  
  
The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you  
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear  
  
Burning farms and squealing pigs  
A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison  
Bite me, bite me  
  
"Ladies and gentlemen  
Be heartlessly welcome!  
To Cirque De Morgue  
And what a show we have for you tonight!"  
  
Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes  
Mindless ghouls with lots of limbs to lose  
Illusionists, contortionist,  
Tightrope - walkers thightening the noose  
  
Horde of spiders, closet tentacles  
Laughing harpies with their tallons ripping  
Sher-chrisss, per-vizz  
  
The pendulum still sways for you  
Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner  
Fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders
