It was a curious sight to me  
A castle older than a redwood tree  
Once lived in by royalty  
Who taxed and raped the land  
  
Mostly now it was stone and dust  
Long damp halls and smells of must  
Faded walls and ancient rust  
Built on shifting sand  
And I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To smash that sucker down  
  
It was a marvelous sight to see  
A redhead workin' in a brasserie  
Five foot nine built to a tee  
Eyes so blue and bright  
All the drunks were just circling round  
I drank water and held my ground  
Later on we did the town  
And we caught every sight  
  
Cause I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To follow her down  
Sightseein' freein' my soul  
Sightseein' leavin' my soul  
  
It was a magical sight to me  
And Yves Tanguy in a gallery  
The 30's looking back at me  
As if he really knew  
I marveled at the artistry  
Predating or technology  
The vision there for all to see  
Bold and strong and true  
  
And I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To take that painting home  
I wanted I wanted  
I wanted to take that vision home
