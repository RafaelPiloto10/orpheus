Behind her eyes there's curtains  
But they've been closed to hide the flames  
Remains  
  
She know's there future's burning  
But she can smile just the same  
  
And though her mood is fine today  
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways  
  
Standing like a statue  
A chin of stone a heart of clay  
Hey  
  
And though he's to big a man to say  
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways  
  
Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting
away...  
Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting
away...
