Eyes make their peace in difficulties with wounded lips and salted cheeks.  
And finally we step to leave to the departure lounge of disbelief.  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time.  
And I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight.  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight.  
  
And the canyon underneath the trees  
Behind the dark sky you looked at me.  
I fell for you like autumn leaves  
Never faded evergreen  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time  
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time.  
  
I can't face, now everything has changed  
I just wanna be by your side  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I wanna make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight.
