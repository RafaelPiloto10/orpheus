This is America  
POD and Santana live in La Casa  
Live and direct for you and yours  
Yo America, America  
  
Was it the way that she looked at me  
She had caught my eye  
She stole my heart she freed my mind  
The way we loved it was magical  
Truly wonderful  
It was me and your so beautiful  
  
And I know that you feel this too  
Will our dreams come true  
I believe in you  
Show me the way to my better days  
What's the price to pay  
If I follow you
