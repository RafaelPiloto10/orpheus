Chorus  
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty  
All these bitches call me racked up shawty x2  
  
Meek Mill  
Racks all on my wrist, racks all on my neck  
I spend racks all on my bitch look at these racks all on my check  
Nigga I'm racked up and I'm racked out fuck a bitch til she tap out  
Fuck a bitch then I pass out and my pockets all in Jay Stack house  
Cus I balled hard I'm swag out all black Maybachs out  
Ya niggas just spit shit and I live the shit that I rap bout  
See these racks came from my crack house dirty money like diddy  
Hammers niggas aint never seen got 30 off in that 50  
Now tell them hoes that I'm busy tell them hoes that I'm ballin  
I done fucking not answered now why this hoe keep callin  
Ya niggas be frauding acting like Yo Gotti  
That shit you call your stash nigga that's racks off in my pocket  
  
Chorus  
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty  
All these bitches call me racked up shawty x2  
  
Fabolous  
My shoes cost me a rack, my outfit off the rack  
My presidential Rolly, I'm callin that Ba-rack  
Damn I meant Barack too much Ciroc  
Wont catch me in that passenger that's word to Pac  
That's word to Big rest in peace to the legends  
  
Kill niggas for acting rest in peace to them legends  
Catch me in that Aston I'm what's up fuck askin  
They talk behind my bitch back they must have seen her ass then  
From H-Town like the Astros scorecard her ass 10  
Pop pills no aspirin like a ski slope in Aspen

Niggas know my flow cold so I don't ride I ski tracks, I'm  
  
Chorus  
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty  
All these bitches call me racked up shawty x2  
  
French Montana  
Racked up I'm racked out, black Ferrari blacked out  
Black Friday, black Mac, poppin Spades black jack  
Bitch I'm hotter than fish grease made 250 this week  
Baddest bitch all in her ballin bitch sports center  
Ass fat can't sit straight ballin like Griff, Blake  
Chain blue and white Penn State touring off a Mixtape  
Racked up shawty chain bout 40  
Came in with one bitch left out with 40  
Shout my homey Meek Mill shout my homey Fabo

Racked up shawty, racked up shawty  
All these bitches call me racked up shawty x2
