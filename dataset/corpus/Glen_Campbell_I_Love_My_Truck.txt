Well, it'll just get you down  
If you let life get to you  
Cause everybody's saying something  
None of it's true  
  
Well, I just don't care  
When them times get hard  
Cause I got everything I need  
Right out in my yard  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love my truck  
She's right outside  
I ain't got much love  
But I sure got a ride  
It don't matter who lived  
It don't matter who lied  
I got my truck right by my side  
  
You got Sally and you got Sue  
And I got a Chevrolet  
She takes me home after work  
Don't ever miss a day  
  
She don't care what I am  
She don't care what I ain't  
But she ain't no cheap pickup  
She just needs a couple coats of paint  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
She don't care  
If I don't work a lick  
She'll start every time  
If the choke don't stick  
  
I know that she will  
Never doubt me  
Cause she never leaves home  
Without me  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
I got my truck right by my side, yeah  
I got my truck right by my side
