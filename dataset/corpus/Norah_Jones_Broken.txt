He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile  
Guess he's been that way for quite awhile  
Got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim  
Did he do it to himself, or was it done to him?  
  
People think he don't look well  
But all he needs from what I can tell  
Is someone to help wash away all the paint  
From his purple hands before it gets too late  
  
I saw him stand alone under a broken street light  
So sincere, singing silent night  
But the trees were full, and the grass was green  
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen  
  
He may move slow  
But that don't mean he's going nowhere  
He may be moving slow  
But that don't mean he's going nowhere
