How many times have you told me you love her  
As many times as I wanted to tell you the truth  
How long have I stood here beside you  
I lived through you, you looked through me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Still with me is only you  
Ooh, Solitude  
I can't stay away from you  
  
How many times have I done this to myself  
How long will it take before I see  
When will this hole in my heart be mended  
Who now is left alone but me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Forever me and forever you  
Ooh, Solitude  
Only you, Only true  
  
Everyone leaves me stranded  
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind  
I can't stay here another night  
  
Your secret admirer, who could it be  
  
Can't you see all along it was me  
How can you be so blind as to see right through me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Still with me as only you  
Ooh, Solitude  
I can't stay away from you  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Forever me and forever you  
Ooh, Solitude  
Only you, only true
