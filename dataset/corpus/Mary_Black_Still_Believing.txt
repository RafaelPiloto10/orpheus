Night owns my white bones  
But what's left is still saying  
Strange prayers in high places  
Wild airs with wilder graces  
Birds fly with no motion  
What draws me, draws the ocean  
  
[Chorus]  
Down on my knees again, still believing  
In the time of reason no more  
Down on my knees again, still believing  
Peace of mind is worth any chore  
  
Great dreams and laid schemes  
Just blown down by high winds  
And strong signs from old forces  
Wild dogs run trackless courses  
Night changes sweet mountains  
Vain hopes need cold fountains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Night owns my white bones  
But what's left is still saying  
  
[Chorus]
