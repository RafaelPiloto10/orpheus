If I wasn't a ghost  
I couldn't walk into you  
If I wasn't the snow  
How could I fall for you?  
If I wasn't a songbird  
How could I call you?  
If I wasn't a fly on the wall  
I wouldn't know all about you  
  
I'm everything and everywhere  
Can you see me in your own reflection?  
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe  
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between  
I'm everywhere  
I'm reaching out in every direction  
I believe I'm in your water too cause you act just like you need me  
I'm everywhere  
  
If I wasn't the fire  
How could you stoke me up inside?  
If I wasn't a party  
How could you be the life of me?  
If I wasn't a camera  
How could you be so photogenic? Yeah I said it  
If I wasn't the hands on the clock  
How could you know that the time was right tonite?  
  
I'm everything and everywhere  
Can you see me in your own reflection?  
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe  
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between  
I'm everywhere  
I'm reaching out in every direction  
I believe I'm in your water too cause you act just like you need me  
  
I got a mind like a spy on a satellite checking you out  
I'm like a fly with my infinite eyes  
I can see with all my senses and I'm coming to get you  
I'm invisible expendable and omnipresent  
  
I'm everywhere  
Can you see me in your own reflection?  
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe  
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between  
I'm everywhere  
I'm reaching out in every direction  
I believe I'm in your water too cause you act just like you need me  
I'm everywhere  
I'm everywhere  
I'm everywhere  
I'm everywhere
