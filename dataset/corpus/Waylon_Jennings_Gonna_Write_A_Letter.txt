I'm gonna write a letter, gonna mail it today  
Just as soon as I think of the words to say  
I've been needing to send it for nearly a year  
There's a woman back home who's waiting to hear  
  
I meant to tell you, dear Susannah  
I'm a long way from Louisiana and you  
And I know I promised to be returning  
Just as soon as I've saved the money I'm earning for you  
  
But I'm married to twins and I'm living in Peru  
Well, I'm gonna write a letter  
Get it off my mind  
But you know the words  
Are so hard to find  
  
Sitting, thinking with my pen in my hand  
How can I make her understand?  
I meant to tell you, dear Julia  
  
I'm a long way from the States, mosquitoes and you  
I'll send some money to help with the kids  
I'd like to thank you for all that you did  
It's true Louisiana, and I'm with Susannah, too  
  
Got me a letter, it arrived today  
The words I read just blew me away  
I don't believe I've ever felt so low  
How could Susannah treat me so?  
  
She said, "I meant to tell you, my sweet honey  
I'm a long way from your love, your money and you  
Please don't think me under  
  
And I do believe you'll understand me too  
I got a bar and grill with Phil in Kalamazoo
