This morning I made the call  
The one that ends it all  
Hanging up,I wanted to cry  
But dammit,this well's gone dry  
Not for the money,not for the fame  
Not for the power,just no more games  
But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado  
I can't replace the lies,that let a 1000 days go  
No more living trapped inside  
Anyway I'll surely die  
In the eye of the tornado,blow me away  
  
You'll grow to loathe my name  
You'll hate me just the same  
You won't need your breath  
And soon you'll meet your death  
Not from the years,not from the use  
Not from the tears,just self abuse  
  
Who's to say,what's for me to say...be...do  
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me  
The land of opportunity  
The golden chance for me  
My future looks so bright  
Now I think I've seen the light  
  
Can't say what's on my mind  
Can't do what I really feel  
In this bed I made for me  
Is where I sleep,I really feel  
I warn you of the fate  
Proven true to late  
Your tongue twist perverse  
Come drink now of this curse  
And now I fill your brain  
I spin you round again  
My poison fills your head  
As I tuck you into bed  
You feel my fingertips  
You won't forget my lips  
You'll feel my cold breath  
It's the kiss of death
