Today...find my way  
I met a man in gray  
Yesterday  
  
Told a story, oh  
Can't bring them though  
He was so  
  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
(wake up)  
  
Tomorrow, I will sit down fine  
I'm gonna pay good mind  
He left behind  
  
Saw...he knows I know  
Hovering I'll go  
He was so  
  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
(wake up)  
  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
The dream is over  
  
The dream is over  
The dream is over...
