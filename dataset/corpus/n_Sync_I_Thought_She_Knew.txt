Do-do-do [Repeats]  
  
She was my once in a lifetime,  
Happy ending come true.  
Oh, I guess I should have told her,  
I thought she knew  
  
Do-do-do,  
She said I took her for granted,  
That's the last thing I would do.  
Whoa, I'll never understand it,  
Cause I thought she knew.  
I thought she knew:  
My world revolved around her,  
My love light burned for her alone.  
But she couldn't see the flame,  
Only myself to blame.  
I should've known,  
I should've known.  
  
A heart full of words left unspoken  
Now that we're through  
I'd sell my soul "to have this silence broken"  
I thought she knew my world revolved around her  
My love light burned for her alone  
But she couldn't see the flame  
Only myself to blame  
I should've known  
I should've known  
  
She was my once in a lifetime,  
Happy ending come true.  
Whoa,  
I guess I should of told her,  
But I thought she knew.  
I thought she knew,  
I thought she knew  
  
I though that, she, knew,  
Yeah
