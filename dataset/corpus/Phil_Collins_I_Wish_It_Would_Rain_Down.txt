You know I never meant to see you again  
But I only passed by as a friend... yeah  
All this time I stayed out of sight  
I started wondering why  
  
Now I... ooo now I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain on me  
  
You said you didn't need me in your life  
Oh I guess you were right... yeah  
Ooo I never meant to cause you no pain  
But it looks like I did it again... yeah  
  
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo girl I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain on me  
  
Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside  
And I know... well it's eating me through, it's eating me through every night
and day  
I'm just waiting on your sign  
  
'Coz I know, I know... I never meant to cause you no pain  
And I realize I let you down... ooo yeah  
But I know in my heart of hearts  
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no  
  
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Oh you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me  
Just rain down over me  
Just let it rain down, let it rain down, let it rain down... ooo yeah  
Let it rain down  
Rain down over me  
Just let it rain down  
Just let it rain down  
Let it rain down  
Just let it rain
