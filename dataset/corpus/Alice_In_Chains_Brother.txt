  
  
  
Frozen in the place I hide  
Not afraid to paint my sky with  
Some who say I've lost my mind  
Brother try and hope to find  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain so don't you run away  
Like you used to do  
Roses in a vase of white  
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves  
That fall because my hand is pulling them hard as I can  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain and I won't run away  
Like I used to do  
Pictures in a box at home  
Yellowing and green with mold  
So I can barely see your face  
Wonder how that color taste  
You were always so far away  
I know the way so don't you run away  
Like you used to do  
Like you used to do
