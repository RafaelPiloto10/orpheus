Oh my love  
It's a long way we've come  
From the freckled hills  
To the steel and glass canyons  
  
From the stony fields  
To hanging steel from skies  
From digging in our pockets  
For a reason not to say goodbye  
  
These are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
  
Last saw your face  
In a water colored sky  
As sea birds argue A long goodbye  
  
I took your kiss  
On the spray of a new lined star  
You gotta live in your dreams  
Don't make them so hard  
  
And these are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
  
Of all of the promises  
Is this one we can keep  
Of all of the dreams  
Is this one still out of reach?  
  
Its early fall  
There's a cloud in the New York skyline  
Innocence...dragged across a yellow line  
  
These are the hands that built America  
These are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
Ah ah ah...America
