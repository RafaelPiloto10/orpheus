I got lumps in my throat  
When I saw her comin' down the aisle  
I got the wiggles in my knees  
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled  
Well there she is again  
Standin' over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin'  
  
Well if she's in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it  
C'mon queenie let's shake it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Won't someone tell me  
Who's the queen standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Meanwhile, I was still thinkin', hmmmm,  
Well if it's a slow one  
We'll omit it  
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it  
If it's a good one, she'll admit it  
C'mon queenie, let's get with it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie
