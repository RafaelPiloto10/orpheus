He slipped the ring off his finger  
When he walked in the room  
And he found him some stranger  
And promised her the moon  
How many lies you must have told  
You think you're a rich man  
With your pocket full of gold  
  
For another man's treasure  
You'd say anything  
But is one night of pleasure  
Worth the trouble you'll bring  
Don't look so surprised  
'Cause son I should know  
I once was a rich man  
With my pocket full of gold  
  
Some night you're gonna wind up  
On the wrong end of a gun  
Some jealous guy's gonna show up  
And you'll pay for what you've done  
What will it say on your tombstone  
Here lies a rich man  
With his pocket full of gold  
  
Yeah, here lies a rich man  
With his pocket full of gold
