Green hours  
Blue rope  
Hot wax for hearts are cold  
We're three we're three in the dark tonight  
And baby my snake is a shark tonight  
  
He's got youth on the side  
He's got small purple eyes  
Now he's as straight as a bow  
When there's nobody home  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids speak  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kiss me  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids meet  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss  
Everywhere kiss kiss me  
  
I may like doing (?) high  
I drop my music loud outside  
I drank until the water's dry  
It's all okay till someone dies  
I shoot my name up every vain  
You can't get hurt, you can't complain  
No feet, no hands, no tale, no lies  
He's got youth on his side  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids speak  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kiss me  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids meet  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss  
Everywhere kiss kiss me  
  
We're three, we're three, we're three, we're three  
We're three, we're three in the dark tonight and baby my snake is a shark
tonight
