Hanging above the ground  
All my limbs are bound  
You're on the right hand  
With your head down  
Tears from eyes that cannot see  
He took the blame from me  
So shall it be written  
So shall it be done  
  
Watching, waiting  
Staring at the Son  
Not even knowing  
Who you are  
  
Three hours have gone by  
We start to question why  
Darkness falls in finding out  
Why you must die  
We can no longer see the Son  
The three untie into one  
Please forgive us Father  
We know not what we've done
