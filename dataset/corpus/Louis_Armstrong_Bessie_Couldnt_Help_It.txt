Bessie couldn't help it  
Bessie couldn't help it  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Bessie couldn't help it though she tried to be good  
Oh, so good  
She was pretty as the heaven's above  
Oh, boy but how she could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful, terrible  
But Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
When she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all  
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night  
Why, oh, why did she yell with delight?  
?Cause Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Aww, dumb pe dumb, now people listen  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
No, Bessie couldn't help it though she tried to be good  
Oh, so good  
She was pretty as the heavens above  
And oh, boy how that girl could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful  
Bop, bop be de oww  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Now when she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all boy  
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night  
My oh, my, how she yelled with delight  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could
