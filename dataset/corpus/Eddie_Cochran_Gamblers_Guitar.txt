My guitar, my guitar...  
Tell of the hearts that this vagabond has broken  
Tell of the fun that I've had  
Tell of the lovin' and the laughin' and the jokin'  
Back when I was glad, Lord-Lord, back when I was glad  
Tell it pretty, guitar  
  
Tell of the days when the riverboat was turnin'  
Lord, what a gambler's spree  
Tell her of the hotty way ol' lady luck was burnin'  
Everyone but me, yeah lucky me, everyone but me  
Now, guitar  
  
Tell of the time when I took my biggest gamble  
In a game where hearts were high  
Tell of the funny way my heart began to ramble  
When she caught my eye, yeah when she caught my eye  
Tell it pretty, guitar  
  
Tell all the folks that this life's a game of poker  
A fool and gold must part  
But in this hectic world the biggest fool's the joker  
Who gambles with his heart, Lord-Lord, who gambles with his heart  
One last time guitar  
  
And that's the story of a gambler's guitar...
