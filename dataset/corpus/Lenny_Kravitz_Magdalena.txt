She was only seventeen  
In her prime of life she was lean  
And her only dream was to be on the silver screen  
She hailed from north of baltimore  
Her mama says she'd end up a whore  
And she spent up all her dough at the movie show  
She's all go go go yeah yeah  
She wears her pants on her hips too low  
She learned it all in magazines  
She's magdalene  
Ain't it funny how the sun shines?  
She was only seventeen  
She packed her bag and went to the scene  
She said I'm gonna take on this town I'm gonna be the queen  
She mingled like she'd been there before  
She worked it till they hollered for more  
Then she took off all her clothes  
Now everbody knows  
She's all go go go yeah yeah  
She wears her pants on her hips too low  
She learned it all in magazines  
She's magdalene  
Ain't it funny how the sun shines?
