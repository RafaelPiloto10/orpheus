Tell me there's no need to be afraid  
They're only shadows cast, past this place  
Where voices carry at the speed of sound  
If I should cry before they lay me down  
  
Sorry for the words, words I left unsaid  
Sorry being one of the words I did forget  
All the time we spent, wasted in the end  
Every precious moment taken for granted  
There in the corner of my mind  
Lies the weight of my regret  
Between the shadow and the light  
Ghost you're in my head  
  
Shelter from the storm when I sleep  
There's comfort in the morn, a siren sings  
If only for a moment, I can breathe  
The thought of you comes crashing through on me  
  
Sorry for the words, words I left unsaid  
Sorry being one of the words I did forget  
All the time we spent, wasted in the end  
Every precious moment taken for granted  
There in the corner of my mind  
Lies the weight of my regret  
Between the shadow and the light  
Ghost you're in my head  
Ghost you're in my head  
  
Tell me there's no need to be afraid  
They're only shadows cast past has played  
Where voices carry at the speed of sound  
If I should die before I lay me down  
  
I'm sorry for the way, the way I treated you  
A little bit too late, but if you only knew  
I'd take away the pain, pain I put you through  
I'd do it all again walking in your shoes  
  
There in the corner of my mind  
Lies the weight of my regret  
Between the shadow and the light  
Ghost you're in my head  
Ghost you're in my head
