In my life I see where I've been  
I said that I'd never fall again  
Within myself I was wrong  
My searching ain't over and over  
I know that  
  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes  
When you love a woman  
(Well) You know she's standing by your side  
A joy that lasts forever  
There's a band of gold that shines  
Waiting somewhere, oh, yeah  
  
If I can't believe that someone is true  
To fall in love is so hard to do  
I hope and pray tonight  
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl  
Yes I know, I know that  
  
It's enough to make you cry  
When you see her walking by  
And you look into her eyes  
  
When you love a woman  
When you love, love, love, love  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes
