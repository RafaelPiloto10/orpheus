Caught up in the daily grind  
Hard to find some peace of mind  
'Round here lately  
  
Trying to escape the beaten path  
To near the wrath of the world  
It just had me crazy  
Ooh crazy  
  
Just something to look forward to  
Along with you  
I still get lost in you baby  
It's always you, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all that comes together  
We're meant, two animals  
We've got something sacred  
You've become a ritual  
Our spirits feed each other  
We never get our fill  
Onward for your sweet religion  
You've become my ritual  
  
When I am with you all time stands still  
If I had the will then  
Pressure just doesn't phase me  
  
You more than take my breath way  
You captivate, we levitate  
You amaze me  
Ooh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual  
I want you baby  
  
Celebrate the love we found  
Make my world go round  
In your arms where I belong  
Makes me love all night long  
All night long  
  
You're all I see  
Heaven's here with me  
Need this time alone  
Send my spirit free  
Free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual
