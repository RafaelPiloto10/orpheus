Was always waiting for the crush  
The car to drive right through the shops  
To call in sick and late at work  
And take a holiday..  
  
Was always tangled up in knots  
To keep myself from speaking up  
But no-one's listening anyway  
Just trying to bribe me..  
  
And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?  
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear  
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand  
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man  
  
Today I wrote a bad cheque  
Packed a bag and took a jet  
But no-one's looking anyway  
I hope they miss me  
  
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.
