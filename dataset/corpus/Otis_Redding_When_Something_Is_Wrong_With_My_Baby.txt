When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me  
  
I know when she's a little worried  
I feel that same old misery  
We've been through so much together  
We stand as one and that's what makes it better  
  
When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me  
  
Just what she means to me you out there just can't understand it  
People can say my woman, she's no good  
But she's my woman and I know I'm her only man  
And if he's got a problem, I got to help him solve ?em  
  
When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me
