You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man  
You do your thinking with a one track mind  
Keep talkin' about heaven glory but  
On your face is a different story  
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty  
Wash out your mouth  
Your lies are getting rusty  
Can't believe nothing you say  
'cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you're funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old thing  
You never changed  
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing  
  
I got something to tell ya  
I got something to tell you baby  
But you ain't hip to baby  
Blowin' minds is a thing of the past  
You blew your chance that's why you never last  
You want to be a graduate mother  
But in reality just another brother  
You think you slick but could  
Stand a lot of greasing  
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'  
Can't believe nothin' you say  
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old thing  
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing  
You beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful  
  
Brought yourself a pot of baked stew  
Nothin' worse than an educated fool  
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation  
But peace and love is a famous generation  
What's in your head has really started  
Showing your conversation gettin' kinda boring  
Can't believe nothin' you say  
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old game  
Same old thing you never change  
Same old game, same old thing  
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing
