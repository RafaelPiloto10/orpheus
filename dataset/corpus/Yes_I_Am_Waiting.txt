Am I waking to this magic  
Am I seeing all is human  
Human after all  
  
I want to be inside your heart  
Are you ready  
I want to love forever  
Are you thinking  
I want to be inside your heart  
What I'm thinking  
I want to know you're with me  
  
Highways, stairways, many ways  
To be open tonight  
High time, look inside  
Your life, I am waiting  
  
I am waiting: are you ready?  
I am waiting: can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
It happened in the water  
The heaven will fall  
The break in the water  
The secret birth  
  
Said she loves me I believe her  
Waited lifetimes say this to you  
  
I want to be inside your heart  
Are you ready  
I want to love forever  
Are you thinking  
I want to be inside your heart  
What I'm thinking  
I want to know you're with me  
  
Highways, stairways, many ways to be open tonight  
High time, look inside  
Your life, I am waiting  
Say you need me I'm yours  
Say you need me just because  
(It's our freedom)  
It's our freedom, hear me now  
We are made to be here now  
We'll be waiting for the word  
As the healing of the world  
Make the promises to be true  
All my life my world is you  
  
I am waiting are you ready?  
Are you ready?  
I am waiting: Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?
