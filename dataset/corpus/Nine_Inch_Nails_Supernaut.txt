Practially every one of the top 40 records being played on  
Every radio station in the united states is a communication to the  
Children to take a trip, to cop out, to groove. The psychedelic  
Jackets on the record albums have their own hidden symbols and  
Messages as well as the lyrics to all the top rock songs and they all  
Sing the same refrain: it's fun to take a trip, put acid in your veins.  
  
I want to reach out and touch the  
I want to touch the sun  
But I don't want to fly  
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon  
And find a distant? Man a-waving his spoon?

I've crossed the ocean, ? Turned every bend?  
I found the? Crossing near? A golden rainbow's end  
I've been through magic and through life's reality  
I've lived a thousand years it never bothered me  
  
Bothered me  
Supernaut  
Bothered me  
Supernaut  
  
They all sing the same refrain:  
It's fun to take a trip, put acid in your veins.

Got no religion, don't need no friends  
Got all I want and I got no need to pretend  
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind  
I've seen the future and I leave it all behind
