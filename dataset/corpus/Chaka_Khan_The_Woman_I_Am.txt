Hey sister  
I never knew which way to go  
Everybody had an answer  
So I said  
Go lecture someone, go lecture someone  
  
I could feel it in my heart babe  
I couldn't scream, I couldn't shout  
I had to find out in my own way  
Ran into someone - ran into someone  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I had to learn to trust myself  
I had to learn just when to say no  
Always trying to please someone else  
I had to let go, I had to let go  
  
The world is filled of many wonders  
I had to look to heaven for my own  
I saw the star that I was unter  
Lord lead me back home, lead me back home  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I can look at myself and I'm not afraid  
I have finally learned how to love  
I can feel everything that I've never felt  
And I'm sure now that I've always known
