John Lee Hooker - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar (Orpheum Music, 1959)  
  
A traditional song similar to My Little Boat Is Empty. Nick's song is also
available.  
  
You know I rowed a little boat,  
Five miles 'cross the pond  
You know I rowed a little boat,  
'bout five miles 'cross the pond  
I throwed my things in the little boat,  
It rolled me right along  
  
  
It was thunderin' and lightenin',  
But it rolled me right along  
It was thunderin', it was lightenin',  
Oh yeah, it rolled me right along  
There were thousands of people,  
They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
  
  
Little children they were screamin'  
And cryin', Oh yeah  
The wind was howlin',  
They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
There were thousands o' people,  
They's goin' from door to door, mmm  
  
  
My little boat kept rollin',  
It kept on rollin',  
You know it rolled me right along  
Mmm-mmm, Kept on rollin,  
Kept on rollin' Kept on rollin'  
Kept on rollin', Rollin'
