It's not time to make a change  
Just relax, take it easy  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to know  
Find a girl, settle down  
If you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
I was once like you are now  
And I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found  
Something going on  
But take your time, think a lot  
Think of everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow  
But your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain?  
When I do he turns away again  
It's always been the same, same old story  
From the moment I could talk  
I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change  
Just sit down, take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down  
If you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I've cried  
Keeping all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right I'd agree  
But it's them they know, not me  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go
