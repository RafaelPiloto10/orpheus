[Chorus: x2]  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Huh, it's like that that there  
They love it when I let down my hair  
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson  
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel  
So I let 'em all come to my back table  
Roll up and lick the paper if they able  
Bottles of everything, models and everything  
Everything goes and yes I mean everything  
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'  
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'  
So, I invite her over to my party  
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie  
No autographs, I ain't signin' now  
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down  
My life is like one big highlight  
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion  
With some whites, some asians and persians  
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'  
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains  
She say she wanna be an actress  
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action!  
Take one, take two, now cut  
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck  
Huh, yeah, here we go again  
I gotta go behind the club just to get in  
They say I'm just too much commotion  
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open  
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub  
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"  
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass  
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room  
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues  
I just stepped in for a quick cameo  
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio  
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe  
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go  
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight  
Yes, these Hollywood nights  
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out  
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out  
Cameras flashin', police passin'  
Every little model wanna give me some action  
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it  
Get some menage, durin' every visit  
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me  
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy  
  
[Chorus: x2]
