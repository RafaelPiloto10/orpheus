You are doing wrong again it's plain for all to see  
And you think here at home is where I ought to be  
There's gonna be some changes made when you get in tonight  
Cause I'm gonna teach you wrong from right  
With my big iron skillet in my hand  
Gonna show you how a little woman quits a great big man  
If you live through the fight we're gonna have when you get home  
You'll wake up and find yourself alone  
[ steel ]  
You say you're sick and tired of me and that I look a mess  
But it's never done on you this is my only dress  
I have never met a man who's quite the likes of you  
I don't know why I ever said I do  
With my big iron skillet...  
With my big iron skillet...
