Hit me like a hammer to my head  
We thrashed in bed baby  
Drove a truck right through my life  
Struck me like a knife  
There's a finger in my pie, someone else's guy  
Caught you with your pants down, fingers in the till  
Caught you stealing something, my last thrill  
  
[Chorus:]  
At war with the world as this life unfurls  
Ooh, better get ready  
At war with the world, as this life unfurls  
Better get ready  
Living like a hound dog who's not fed  
Life's one big bed baby  
From the trash right on the street and anyone you meet  
Trying to make the first glance and I doubt you will last  
Caught you with your pants down fingers in the till  
I guess I've swallowed life's hardest pill  
[Chorus]  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
(Repeat chorus twice)
