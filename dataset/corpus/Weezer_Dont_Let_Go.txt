Whoa-oh-oh x 2  
  
Any time that you want  
I'll be here in your arms  
Silently hlding on  
To the girl with the charms  
  
But if there  
Comes a day  
You should turn your heart away  
I'll be down  
On my knees  
Begging for that girl to stay  
  
Don't let go  
Oo whoa-oh-oh (x 2)  
  
Anything you desire  
I will set at your feet  
With a kiss in the air  
For the Gods to receive  
  
But if there  
Comes a day  
You should turn your heart away  
I'll be down  
On my knees  
Begging for that girl to stay  
  
Confrontations in my mind  
Got me running out of time  
  
Don't let go  
Oo whoa-oh-oh (x 2)  
  
But if there  
Comes a day  
You should turn your heart away  
I'll be down  
On my knees  
Begging for that girl to stay  
  
Confrontations in my mind  
Got me running out of time  
  
Don't let go  
Oo whoa-oh-oh (x 4)
