Got up this morning  
Along about dawn  
Without a warning  
I found she was gone  
  
Why should she do it  
How could she do it  
She'd never done it  
Before...  
  
Am I blue?  
Am I blue?  
Ain't these tears  
In these eyes  
Tellin' you?  
  
Am I blue?  
You'd be too  
If your dreams  
And your schemes  
Just fell through  
  
Was a time  
I was her only one  
But now I'm  
The sad and  
Lonely one  
  
Was I gay  
Till today?  
Now she's gone  
And we're through  
Am I blue?
