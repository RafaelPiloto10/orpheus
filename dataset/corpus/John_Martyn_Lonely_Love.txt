You couldn't change it if you tried  
Sometimes it seems, oh darling  
It seems that you were born to cry  
Trying for so long  
But your sweet sweet love keeps going wrong.  
  
Take a chance, take a chance on a  
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy  
Oh darling, try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy.  
  
You been let down time after time  
And now I'm begging you, please, please, please  
Try to put your little heart back on the line  
Forget those tears you cried  
Leave them to the falling rain outside.  
  
Take a chance, take a chance on a  
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy  
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy.  
  
Forget those tears you cried  
Leave them to the falling rain outside  
Take a chance, take a chance on a  
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy  
Oh please, try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy.  
  
Darling call my number any time you please  
Little to be only love  
Call my number any time.
