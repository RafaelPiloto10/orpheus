Seems like only yesterday  
Life belonged to runaways  
Nothing here to see  
No looking back  
Every sound monotone  
Every color monochrome  
Light began to fade  
Into the black  
  
Such a simple animal  
Sterilized with alcohol  
I could hardly  
Feel me anymore  
  
Desperate and meaningless  
All filled up with emptiness  
Felt like everything  
Was said and done  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
  
Still I tried to find my way  
Spinning now was end of days  
Burning like a flame  
Behind my eyes  
  
Drown it out  
Drink it in  
Crown the king of suffering  
Prisoner, slave to the disguise  
  
Disappear the only thing  
Bittersweet surrendering  
Knew that it was time  
To say goodbye  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
No reason left  
Me to survive  
You saved me  
The day you came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
Nothing wrong to give  
I can finally live  
Come alive  
You're laughing at me  
I can finally breathe  
Come alive  
  
Lay me down in the dark  
Open my eyes  
You saved me  
The day you came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive
