Lovin you isn't the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things that I feel?  
If I could, baby I'd give you my world  
But how can I when you won't take it from me  
You can go your own way  
You can call it on the lonely days  
You can go your own way  
Tell me why everything turns around  
Backin up, shaking it's all you wanna do  
If I could, baby I'd give you my socks  
Open up, everything's waiting for you  
You can go your own way  
You can call it on the lonely days  
You can go your own way
