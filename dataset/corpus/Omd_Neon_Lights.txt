Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
I dream of you  
With me tonight  
We're all alone  
Under the neon lights  
  
And walking home  
You're by my side  
The neon lights  
Are in our eyes  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light
