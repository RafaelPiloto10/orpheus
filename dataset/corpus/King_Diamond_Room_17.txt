Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah  
A few stains on the wall  
But that was nothing new to Harry's head  
Even though he was strapped down to his bed  
Strapped down  
Harry felt pretty good  
Knock knock  
Knock knock is anybody there?  
  
Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah  
But it didn't have the string that would ring the nurse  
It wasn't there  
Poor harry, he had it coming  
Poor harry  
Sow he didn't feel so good  
  
Here comes doctor eastmann and nursie needle dear  
Look at what they got you the crawly box  
  
"Don't be such a baby, harry stop that now  
The doctor's here to help you it's eastmann time!"  
  
In room 17, everything is so clean  
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen  
  
"Black, brown, grey and hairy  
We've got them all  
Big, small, fast and scary  
Yeah, we've got them all  
I can hear hit, the spider's lullaby  
I can feel it, the spider's crawl on by"  
  
In room 17, everything is so clean  
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen  
  
"Nurse needle, it is time to begin  
Nurse needle, stick it in  
A brown lycosa's what I've got inside this box  
I'm gonna let him out to see just how you feel  
When he's around  
If you move too much he might just bite you  
But we'll just have to wait  
And see about that"  
  
Deep into the night, they were testing him  
So many different species, harry could not win  
  
They forgot the grey one, she was full of eggs  
And she would find a warm spot back in Harry's neck  
It's so moist and warm in here  
Knock knock  
Knock knock is anybody there?  
  
"You forgot some spiders in my room yesterday  
Now I've got this stunning pain  
And my neck is feeling weird, oh I might die  
Overnight some of your spiders must have bit me  
They were all over me!"  
  
"Oh harry, don't be such a fool."  
  
That same night harry died  
When they found him he was grey and white  
  
Black, brown, grey and hairy  
We've got them all  
Big, small, fast and scary  
Yeah, we've got them all  
I can hear hit, the spider's lullaby  
I can feel it, the spider's crawl on by  
  
In room 17, everything is so clean  
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen  
  
Take him to the morgue  
Take him to the morgue
