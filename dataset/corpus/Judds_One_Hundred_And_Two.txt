There's one hundred and one  
Little reasons why  
I should leave you here say goodbye  
But I just can't seem to say we're through  
  
And the reasons why  
Are one hundred and two  
One hundred and one  
Little tears fall  
And every drop  
  
Makes me feel so small  
But hard as I try  
I can't leave you  
  
And the reasons why baby  
Are one hundred and two  
I'm countin' up  
  
The times I've cried  
The times you'd leave  
The times you lied  
And everyday  
  
I'm keeping score  
When it all adds up  
I need you more  
One hundred and one  
Lonely nights  
  
You leave me here  
Now honey, that ain't right  
But, still I forgive  
Everything you do  
  
And the reasons why  
Are one hundred and two  
Yeah, the reasons why baby  
Are one hundred and two  
There's one hundred and one  
  
Little reasons why  
But, one hundred and two  
Keeps me by your side
