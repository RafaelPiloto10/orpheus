Hey, ahh  
Ahh, yea yeah  
  
Had your name all tattooed on my heart  
It's gone, how could this be wrong  
It's unbelievable, unbelievable  
Just the picture of me  
Left out in this Hollywood Babylon  
Was unbelievable, unbelievable  
  
So let my greatest fear walk out the door, ahh  
This ain't what we're fighting for, ahh  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
It's unbelievable  
  
Girl, I picture how the ghost of you  
Would follow me everywhere  
It's undeniable, unbelievable  
If I couldn't feel your velvet lips  
Your fingers run through my hair  
It's inconceivable, unbelievable  
  
So let my greatest fear walk out the door, ahh  
This ain't what we're fighting for  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Ahh, never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
  
Did you really think about it  
What we could be missing  
I found it so hard to believe, yeah  
Unbelievable, it's unbelievable, yeah  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Ahh, never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
  
You don't say that it's over, over, yeah  
Ahhh, never thought this could die  
Oh but you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
Unbelievable, yeah, unbelievable
