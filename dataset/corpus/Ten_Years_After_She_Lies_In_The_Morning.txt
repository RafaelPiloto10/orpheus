She lies in the morning  
Red sky is the warning, yes it is  
She lies in the morning  
Red sky is in her eyes  
She cries cause the morning is too long  
She tries, but she still can't carry on  
She lies to escape the morning sun  
She dies and the world still caries on  
  
Where did you go?  
Why did you fall?  
She didn't know there's nothing at all  
  
You killed yourself, my love  
There's nothing left for me  
Life was a pain, but now you're free  
You shot your soul, my love  
Blew all you had  
Now, I'm left here feeling bad  
You shot your life away  
For the unreal  
Now, there's nothing left to feel  
You made your tracks, my love  
You made them deep  
Now, there's nothing left but sleep
