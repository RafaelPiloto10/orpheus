My friends say you're so into me  
And that you need me desperately  
They say you say we're so complete  
  
But I need to hear it straight from you  
If you want me to believe it's true  
I've been waiting for so long it hurts  
I want to hear you say the words, please  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't, don't let me be the last to know  
Don't hold back, just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
Oh, if you love me so  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
Ooh  
  
Your body language says so much  
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch  
But 'til you say the words it's not enough  
Come on and tell me you're in love, please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on baby, come on darling, ooh yeah  
Come on, let me be the one  
Come on now, oh yeah  
  
I need to hear you say  
You love me all the way  
And I don't want to wait another day  
I want to feel the way you feel  
Oh, come on  
  
Don't, just let me be the one  
Don't hold back, just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
So, baby, if you love me  
Don't let me be the last to know
