Some say that love is its own  
Love is its own reward  
But I can't help but believe  
There's got to be more.  
A man needs a woman  
To have and to hold  
To love him in body  
As well as in soulI need your desire  
Where did the fire go?  
I keep trying to sleep  
But sleep won't be mine tonight  
There's so much sorrow inside  
And baby, I don't know why.  
I give you your freedom  
I give you my love  
I give all I have every time that we touch  
I don't know, baby,  
Maybe I give too much.  
Now I'm lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
I'm so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love.  
I know that love carries no  
She carries no guarantees  
But still I can't seem to  
Find a reason that I can believe in  
You said to be patient  
And give you some room  
You said you had changes  
You need to work through  
But the longer I wait  
The farther I feel from you.  
Now I'm lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
I'm so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love.  
Now I'm lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
I'm so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love.  
Baby, you're my one and only  
Why do you keep me lonely in love.
