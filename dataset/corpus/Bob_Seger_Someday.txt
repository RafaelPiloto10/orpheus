Someday, I know I'll find that road  
And I, will pay back all I've owed  
Someday  
Somehow, I'll bear that heavy load  
  
I know, I've never been the best  
Never quite kept up with the rest  
  
But someday you'll see I've reached that crest  
Someday  
  
And then we'll smile  
And toast our glasses high  
And the world will know  
You and I  
Till then in spite of all I've done  
  
  
I'll keep on reachin for the sun  
And someday we'll be number one  
Someday
