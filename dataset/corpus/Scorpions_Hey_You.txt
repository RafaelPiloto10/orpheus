Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes  
And the sound of your name  
Hey you, I'm in love with your smile  
And the way you're dressed today  
  
Hey you, well I like the way you walk  
Just like a star moves on stage  
Hey you, well I like the way you talk  
You're really calm for your age  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love 100 times  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
To be your answer  
  
Hey you, I said you know what's going on  
Do you know what I mean  
Hey you, daddy wants you to come  
This school is up to me  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
To be your answer
