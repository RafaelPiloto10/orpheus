Tonight we're gonna hang out  
Me and my girls gonna hit a party  
Gonna wile out  
Manicure, pedicure, so we look tight  
And there's just enough money for the night out  
So now it's time we go hop up in the 6-4  
Drop top down headed for the disco  
Maybe we might catch some guys eyes  
If we don't, we don't care, cuz we still  
Gonna have a good time  
  
It's friday night, got visions in my head  
But Nothin' on mind, so let the music play  
So let me hear you say

We turning heads like a Hummer on the freeway  
We grace threw crowd eyeson us  
People st-st-stutterin' sayin' hey who are they  
Wall to wall, back to back packed so tight
