Rise, let us see you,  
Dawning is the day.  
Miss, misty meadow,  
You will find your way.  
Wake up in the morning, to yourself,  
And leave this crazy life behind you.  
Listen, we're trying to find you.  
Flow to the sea,  
You know where to go.  
But still we are free,  
No one tells the wind which way to blow.  
Wake up in the morning to yourself,  
Open your eyes and start to be you.  
Listen, we think we can see you.  
Baby there's no price upon your head,  
Sing it, shout it,  
Now the angry words have all been said,  
Do it, don't doubt it.  
So rise, let us see you,  
Dawning is the day.  
Miss, misty meadow,  
You will find your way.  
Wake up in the morning to yourself,  
Open your head and look around you.  
Listen, we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we can see you.
