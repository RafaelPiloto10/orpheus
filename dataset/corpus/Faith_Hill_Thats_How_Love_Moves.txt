It's such a mystery  
How she found something in me  
That I never knew was there  
But she uncovered it so easily  
  
She turned me like a season  
And I began to change  
She wrapped herself around me  
Now I'll never be the same  
  
That's how love works  
That's how love moves  
Like a river  
Running through you  
  
Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven  
It consumes you  
But, that's a given  
That's how love moves  
  
I've seen walls that could never be broken  
Come tumbling down  
I've heard the voice of love  
Calling without making a sound  
  
See I was touched by an angel  
The day she took my hand  
You know she's the miracle  
That makes me everything that I am  
  
Sometimes it's just a whisper  
Sometimes it's a storm  
Sometimes it reaches forever  
With it's everlasting arms  
  
That's how love works  
That's how love moves  
Like a river  
Running through you  
  
Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven  
It consumes you  
But, that's a given  
That's how love moves
