I want to get high, but I never could take the pain  
'Cause it would blow away my soul like a hurricane  
Like a one man band clapping in the pouring rain  
If I know where I'm going, I don't know from where I came  
  
Where we gonna be in summertime?  
And are we gonna see the heavens shine  
Like diamonds in the sky?  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road
