We came together in 1982  
Through stormy weather, we sang the blues  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
I've had my troubles, you had yours  
We've had those feeling, but we've endured  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
River of passion  
River of love  
You and me babe  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
The river is wide  
The river is deep  
The river is swift  
But it's oh so sweet  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
And I'm burnin'  
Feel me burnin' in a circle of fire
