I know you're goin'.  
I know this is good-bye.  
And I can't make you stay.  
No matter no matter how I try.  
But ooh if you're leaving.  
Please grant this one request.  
And leave my heart with some happiness.  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna bold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
  
  
If I can't be with you.  
Oh baby all my life.  
The next best thing.  
Is you next to me all through the night.  
  
  
Pull all the shades down.  
Put your heart next to mine.  
Tonight give me a chance.  
To feel heaven just one more time.  
And ooh if you're leaving.  
Honey I'll set you free.  
Just leave my arms this one sweet memory.  
  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna hold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
  
  
If I can't be with you.  
Ooh baby all my life.  
The next best thing.  
Is you next to me all through the night.  
  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna hold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
Baby give me something, tender to remember you by.
