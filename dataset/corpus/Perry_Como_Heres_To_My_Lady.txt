Here's to my lady  
Here's a toast to my lady  
And all that my lady means to meeee  
  
Like a hearth in the winter  
A breeze in the summer  
A spring to remember is sheee  
  
Though the years may grow colder  
As people grow older  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be  
But be it sunshine or shady  
Here's my love to my lady  
I pray may she always love meeeee  
  
musical interlude  
  
Though the years may grow colder  
As people grow older  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be  
But be it sunshine or shady  
Here's my love to my lady  
I pray may she always love meeeeee
