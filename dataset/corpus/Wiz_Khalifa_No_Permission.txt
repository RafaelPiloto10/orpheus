[Intro]  
When I ride by, I want you to see what I see  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Shit's very clear, uh  
  
[Verse]  
Pass me a joint, guarantee Imma hit it  
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it  
I got a old school ass car you can sit in  
I got a crib that you probably can't get in  
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it  
I been at work on the grind for a minute  
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Countin' my benjis  
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it  
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish  
When you stay all on your grind you can get it  
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen  
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention  
I be so high, try me, come visit  
You make a choice, hope you like your decision  
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted  
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician  
Ain't fuck with me then she probably was trippin'  
Lightin' 'em up just like we electricians  
Get to this money, get high, my intentions  
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen  
When we together, we stick to the mission  
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen  
When we together, we stick to the mission  
Rollin' that weed up without no permission, uh  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, oh, money come and money go, we stay the same though  
Oh, oh, money come and money go, we stay the same though
