Meet me for breakfast on an airplane  
We'll crash a party for the Queen of England  
Show me what you've got in the parking lot  
Until we get caught  
  
We can do it if we wanna, let's go mad  
No one's ever gonna stop the fun we'll have  
Woah, let 'em stop and stare  
They must think we care  
But all I see is you  
We can do it if we wanna  
Gonna do whatever we wanna  
  
Strip down to nothing in the ocean  
Buy every bottle of crystal in St. Tropez  
Pass it all around 'til the sun goes down  
And we hit the ground  
  
We can do it if we wanna, let's go mad  
No one's ever gonna stop the fun we'll have  
Woah, let 'em stop and stare  
They must think we care  
But all I see is you  
We can do it if we wanna  
Gonna do whatever we wanna  
  
(Whatever, wanna, whatever we wanna)  
Gonna do..  
  
(Let 'em stop and stare,  
They must think we care!  
But all I see is you  
We can do it if we....)  
  
Wanna, let's go mad  
No one's ever gonna stop the fun we'll have  
Woah, let 'em stop and stare  
They must think we care  
But all I see is you  
We can do it if we wanna, gonna  
Wanna, gonna  
Wanna, gonna do whatever we wanna
