Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
  
I used to be on my own  
Every night, every day by myself  
Feeling so far from home  
How could I know I would go  
Down the road that would lead me right into your arms?  
Destiny told me that you were the one  
Stars fill the sky now I've finally found you  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
I'll give you my heart and soul  
Feel it deep, deep down inside  
  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love, ooo yeah  
  
I thought I was wasting time  
Living in hope that I'd find a new love  
Life can be so unkind  
How could it be you and me took so long  
To discover that dreams do come true?  
Everything's changed since the day I met you  
The sun's gonna shine every time we're together  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
I'll give you my heart and soul  
I'll take you all the way to heaven  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
I'll give you my heart and soul  
Feel it deep, deep down inside  
  
Yesterday has gone  
And from this moment on you will see  
This will be a forever lasting love  
  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
I'll give you my heart and soul  
I'll take you all the way to heaven  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
I'll give you my heart and soul  
Feel it deep, deep down inside  
  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
Give you love, give you love  
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can love you more  
No one can love you more
