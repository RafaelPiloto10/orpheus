By the rivers of Babylon  
Where he sat down  
And there he wept when he remembered Zion.  
  
Oh from wicked, carry us away from captivity  
Required from us a song  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?  
  
So let the words of our mouth  
And the meditations of our hearts  
Be acceptable in thy sight  
Over I  
  
By the rivers of Babylon  
Where he sat down  
And there he wept when he remembered Zion.  
  
Oh from wicked, carry us away from captivity  
Required from us a song  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?
