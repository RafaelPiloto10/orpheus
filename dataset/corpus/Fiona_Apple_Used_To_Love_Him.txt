Those boon times went bust  
My feet of clay, they've dried to dust  
The red isn't the red we painted,  
It's... Just... Rust  
That signature thing that used to bring a following  
I have trouble now, even remembering  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night  
And keep on letting him change all my plans  
I'm either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him  
I sure hope that's it  
  
I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch  
'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush  
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing  
I should have no trouble now to keep from following  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night  
And keep on letting him change all my plans  
I'm either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him  
I sure hope that's it
