There's a star in the palm of my hands  
And I think it's yours  
You don't want me  
Then I'll understand  
You deserve much more  
When I brought it  
Down from the sky, you almost forgot it  
It was new back when you gave a dam  
What ya need I'll go and get it.  
  
But if I don't come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
That's the one thing I'll know  
And if I don't make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'd go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
But it takes me so far  
But I don't care, I'll go  
If I don't make it home  
But at least now you know  
Girl for you, I'll go.  
  
Got my heart in the palm of your hands  
Now you sure that's yours  
If you don't want it  
I wont understand  
Cause I came so far  
When you tossed it  
It took forever to find the place where you lost it  
Now your gone with my heart out the door  
Well its here girl  
Don't forget it.  
  
But if you don't come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
That's the one thing I know  
If you don't make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'll go for you  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'd go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
And it takes me so far  
But I don't care, I'll go  
If I don't make it home  
But at least now you know, I'll go.
