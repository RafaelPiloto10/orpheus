There's something I want to tell you  
There's something I think that you should know  
It's not that I shouldn't really love you  
Let's take it slow  
When we get to know each other  
And we're both feeling much stronger  
Then let's try to talk it over  
Let's wait awhile longer  
  
Let's wait awhile  
Before it's too late  
Let's wait awhile  
Before we go too far  
  
Remember that special night  
When all of the stars were shining bright  
  
But on that very first night  
It wasn't quite right  
  
Let's wait awhile  
  
Before it's too late  
  
Let's wait awhile  
  
Our love will be great  
  
Let's wait awhile  
Before we go too far  
  
I didn't never give up on you (Let's wait awhile)  
Awhile before it's too late  
  
You know you can't rush love  
  
(Ooh hoo hoo)  
Let's wait awhile  
(Ooh hoo hoo)  
Before it's too late  
(Let's wait awhile)  
Wait awhile  
(Our love will be great)  
Let's wait awhile  
(Wait awhile, ooh)  
Before we go too far, (oh, oh, ooh)  
  
La da lee de da da de de de, da da da da la da  
La da lee de da da de de de, da da da da la da da  
La da lee de da da de de de  
Before we go too far  
  
Let's wait awhile
