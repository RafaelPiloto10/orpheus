I always knew what I wanted to be  
I knew for sure, I knew for sure  
Always knew it was them or me  
I wanted more, more and more  
It's alright, it's OK  
None of them people gonna take it away  
'Cause they don't know like I know  
And I can't stop 'cause it drives them crazy  
  
It drives them crazy, 'cause I won't be cool  
It's too late baby  
  
It's the same old desire  
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same  
Burning like fire  
Don't you ever take my name in vain  
  
Always moving, somewhere else to be  
Moving on, moving on  
Scream at you and you scream at me  
Right or wrong, right or wrong  
It's all right, it's OK  
No one's ever gonna take us away  
'Cause they don't know, like I know  
I gotta keep rockin', 'cause it makes me crazy  
  
It makes me crazy, who needs to be cool  
Life's amazing  
  
It's the same old desire  
Crazy train, crazy train  
Burning like fire  
Don't you ever take my name in vain  
Same old desire  
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same  
Burning like fire  
Don't you ever take my name in vain  
Oh yeah  
  
It's the same old desire  
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same  
Burning like fire  
Don't you ever take my name in vain  
Same old desire  
Crazy train, crazy train  
Burning like fire  
Don't you ever take my name in vain
