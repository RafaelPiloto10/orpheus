Like it played loud  
Powerhouse sounds  
My body wants to rock and let it out  
Really high born  
  
Morning till dawn  
I'm going all the way just on and on  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
Teach me to fly  
want to stay high  
I have to live it up before I die  
Nightlife and booze  
Girls to choose  
  
Are you ready, baby, come on let's cruise  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
Getting out of control  
There's nothing that can bring me down  
Nothing I'll leave out tonight  
I'm feeling good, I'm living now!  
  
Like it real hot  
Never can't stop  
I'm running down the line to the top  
Never stay low  
  
I'm on the go  
No one holds me back  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!
