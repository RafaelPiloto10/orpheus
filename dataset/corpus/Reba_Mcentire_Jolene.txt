Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Your beauty is beyond compare  
With flaming locks of auburn hair  
With ivory skin  
And eyes of emerald green  
He talks about you in his sleep  
There's nothing I can do to keep from cryin'  
When he calls your name Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Well you can have your choice of men  
But I could never love again  
He's the only one for me Jolene  
I had to have this talk with you  
My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Jolene  
Jolene  
Jolene
