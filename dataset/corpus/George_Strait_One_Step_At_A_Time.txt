I couldn't help but over hear your conversation  
When you told her that you owned her heart and soul  
You say you've got her wrapped around your finger  
But there's somthin' bout angels you should know  
  
She'll walk away one step at a time  
It'll take you by surprise  
You'll think it happened over night  
It'll be too late when you realize  
Angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time  
  
Don't think that I'm tryin' to mind your business  
It's a full time job just tryin' to mind mine  
But I once had an angel just like her  
And if I'd treated her right  
She'd still be by my side  
  
She'll walk away one step at a time  
It'll take you by surprise  
You'll think it happened over night  
It'll be too late when you realize  
Angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time  
  
It'll be too late when you realize angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time
