Tuna  
Rubber  
A little blubber in my igloo  
And I knew you pigtails and all  
Girls when they fall  
And they said Marianne killed herself  
And I said not a chance  
Don't you love girls ladies babes  
Old bags who say she was so pretty why  
Why why why did she crawl down in the old  
Deep ravine  
  
C'mon pigtails girls and all those sailors  
Get your bags and hold down won't you just  
Hold down cause Ed is watching my every sound  
I said  
They're watching my every sound  
  
The weasal sqeuaks faster then a seven day week  
I said Timmy and that purple Monkey  
Are all down  
  
At Bobby's house  
Making themselves persters and lesters and jesters and my  
Traitors of kind  
And I'm just having thoughts of Marianne  
She could outrun the fastest slug  
She could  
Marianne  
Quickest girl in the frying pan
