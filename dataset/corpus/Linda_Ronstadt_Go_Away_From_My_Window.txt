(John Jacob Niles)  
  
Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away from my bedside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more  
  
I'll go and tell my brothers  
I'll tell my sister too  
The reason why my heart is broke  
Is on account of you  
Is on account of you  
  
I'll give you back your letters  
I'll give you back your ring  
But I'll never forget my own true love  
As long as songbirds sing  
As long as songbirds sing  
  
Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away way way from my beside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more
