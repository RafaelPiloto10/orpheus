[Chorus:]  
She's a modern girl in a modern world  
Where only the strong can survive.  
Too many dreams have been laid at her door,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Where would you fit in the scheme of her day  
And where could you fit in her heart?  
Trying to be small will get you nowhere at all,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
  
She moves through your life like a warm summer breeze,  
And nothing will stand in her way.  
The sound of her voice brings your heart to its knees,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
