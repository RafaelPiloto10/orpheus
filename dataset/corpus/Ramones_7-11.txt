I met her at the 7-11  
Now I'm in seventh heaven  
Tell me, tell me  
Can this be true  
I never thought I'd ever  
Meet a girl like you  
  
She was standing by the Space Invaders  
So I said can I see you later  
Yeah we went for a little spin  
Down to the Holiday Inn  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever thinking of  
  
We went down to the record swap  
The kids were dancing  
To the blitzkrieg bop  
Bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop  
  
What ever happened to the radio  
And where did all the fun songs go  
Summer fun, with the Beach Boys on  
But we all know what went wrong  
Oh-wo-wo  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever dreaming of  
  
And so we went down to the dance  
Which turned into a whole romance  
And after just one night  
I never knew that things could be so right  
Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no  
  
I kissed her and hugged her  
And I said good-bye  
Last thing I knew  
She wouldn't make it alive  
Oncoming car went out of control  
It crushed my baby  
And it crushed my soul  
Now all I've got is sorrow and pain  
Standing out here in the rain  
The crash, shattering glass  
The sirens, and pain  
Is driving me insane oh-yeah  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever thinking of  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea
