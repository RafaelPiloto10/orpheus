Little boy blue  
Come blow your horn  
The dish ran away with the spoon  
Home again home again  
Saturday morn  
Never gets up before noon  
  
She used to render  
You legal and tender  
When you used to  
Send her your promises boy  
A dill or a dollar  
Unbutton your collar  
Come out and holler  
Out all of your noise  
  
Little boy blue  
Come blow your top  
Cut it right down to the quick  
Don't sit home and cry  
On the fourth of July  
Around now you're hittin' bricks  
  
So abracadabra  
Now she disappeared  
Now every thing's Canada dry  
So watch your behavior  
And rattle your cane  
With a bottle of bourbon  
Good-bye  
  
Little boy blow  
Lost little bo peep  
She fell through a hole in the nest  
Now ain't it peculiar  
That she's finally cooled your  
Big wheels just like all of the rest  
  
Whenever it rains  
The umbrella complain  
They're always gettin' played for a chump  
So mark and strike it  
She's history now  
And you're hangin' out at the pump  
  
Little boy blue  
She used to render
