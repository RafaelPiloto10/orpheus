I love to worship You, my God  
I love to worship You, my Lord  
And see Your Spirit fall in power  
Your love unfolding gifts from heaven  
  
I love to worship You, my God  
I love to worship You, my Lord  
And feel Your precious breath of heaven  
Your all consuming love  
  
Holy Spirit come in power change my heart  
I want to live for You, my God  
Let Your Spirit come in power change my life  
That I may live for You my Lord  
Fall on us Lord  
  
So I yearn for You  
Long to see You move  
Lord, I lift my hands  
Before my King and pray
