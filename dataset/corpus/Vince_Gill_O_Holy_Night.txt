O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
  
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine, o night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night, O night divine  
O night divine, O night, O night divine
