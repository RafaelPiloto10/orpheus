Back in the groove now  
I'm so glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
Want your love forever  
  
Couldn't sleep at night  
I'd hold my pillow so tight  
I was wondering why  
When all I wanted was my guy  
Just when I thought that I'd lose my baby  
He came to save me  
Every tear that I cry  
Everyday that went by  
Will be no more  
  
Back in the groove now  
I'm so glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
I couldn't eat  
Without your love, I was so weak  
But now that you're here, my darlin'  
I have no fear  
  
Just when I thought that I'd lose my baby  
He came to save me, yeah  
Everyday that went by  
Every tear that I cry  
Will be no more  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
All the guys in the world  
Couldn't take me away  
From being his girl  
I'm so crazy 'bout you baby  
A broken heart will be no more  
  
I just wanted to say  
That I'm so glad that we're back together again  
And the only other thing I have to say  
That I want your love forever  
I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever
