Never again, isn't that what you said?  
You've been through this before  
An' you swore this time you'd think with your head  
No one, would ever have you again  
And if taking was gonna get done  
You'd decide where and when  
Just when you think you got it down  
Your heart securely tied and bound  
They whisper, promises in the dark  
  
Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night  
But too many opponents made you weary of the fight  
Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in  
All the warnings went off in your head  
Still you had to give in  
  
Just when you think you got it down  
Resistance nowhere to be found  
They whisper, promises in the dark  
  
But promises, you know what they're for  
It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before  
Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure  
And so you put up your guard  
And you try to be hard  
But your heart says try again  
  
You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear  
No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears  
Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost  
On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the cost  
Just when you think you got it down  
Your heart in pieces on the ground  
They whisper, promises in the... Dark
