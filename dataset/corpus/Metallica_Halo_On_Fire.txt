Obey, obey  
Come won't you stay  
Sincere, sincere  
All ends in tears  
Endure, endure  
Thoughts most impure  
Concede, concede  
But both shall we bleed  
  
Oh, Halo on fire  
The midnight knows it well  
Fast, is desire  
Creates another hell  
I fear to turn on the light  
For the darkness won't go away  
Fast, is desire  
Turn out the light  
Halo on fire  
  
Allure, allure  
Sweetness obscure  
Abide, abide  
Secrets inside  
Deprive, deprive  
To feel so alive  
Obey, obey  
Just don't turn away  
  
Oh, Halo on fire  
The midnight knows it well  
Fast, is desire  
Creates another hell  
I fear to turn on the light  
For the darkness won't go away  
Fast, is desire  
Turn out the light  
Halo on fire  
  
Prayers cannot get through  
Return to sender  
Unto which of you  
Shall I surrender  
Twisting in disguise  
Dark resurrection  
Lighting up the skies  
Wicked perfection  
  
Too dark to sleep  
Can't slip away  
Open or close  
My eyes betray  
Beyond the black  
Come won't you stay  
  
Hello darkness, say goodbye  
Hello darkness, say goodbye  
Hello darkness, say goodbye
