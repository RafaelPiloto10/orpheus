So there  
You got me in your clutch again  
So there, so there  
I love your touch  
And that voodoo that you do so well  
It's got me spinnin' round and round and  
  
So let me in your world  
Let me in your world for a while  
Let me in your world so I can sing to ya  
  
Oh no you got me goin' crazy for you baby  
Sayin' oh no you make me go insane for you baby  
  
So there  
Oh oh oh
