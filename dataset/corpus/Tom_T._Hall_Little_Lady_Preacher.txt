Oh, the little lady preacher from the limestone church  
I'll never forget her, I guess  
She preached each Sunday morning on the local radio  
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress  
  
She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault  
But I will admit she knew the Bible well  
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use  
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell  
  
She had a guitar picker by the name of Luther Short  
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin  
She would turn and smile at Luther when the program would commence  
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn  
  
I was picking for her too with what we call the doghouse bass  
I clung to every word that passed her lips  
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come  
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips  
  
The Lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached  
But ol' Luther took her home each Sunday morn'  
Looking back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride  
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born  
  
Sometimes ol' Luther showed up at the studio half-tight  
And smoking was a thing he liked to do  
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me  
I told her in a way that I'd been praying for her too  
  
One Sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone  
Said she and brother Luther had a call  
I can see me standing in that studio that day  
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all  
  
I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since  
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room  
I know ol' Luther Short and he's a hard ol' boy to change  
And I've often sat and wondered who it was converted whom
