Well, my name it is a number  
It's on a piece of plastic film  
And I've been growin' funny flowers  
Outside on my little window sill  
  
And don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
  
You know, my wife still respects me  
Even though I really misuse her  
I am having an affair  
With the random computer  
  
But don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
  
Oh daddy, proud of your planet  
Oh mommy, proud of your sun  
Oh daddy, proud of your planet  
Oh mommy, proud of your sun  
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'  
Like they did when you were young  
Or did they come down crashin'  
Seeing all the things you'd done  
Spacin' out and havin' fun  
  
Oh daddy, proud of your planet  
Oh mommy, proud of your sun  
Oh daddy, proud of your planet  
Oh mommy, proud of your sun  
  
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'  
Like they did when you were young  
Or did they come down crashin'  
Seeing all the things you'd done  
Spacin' out and havin' fun  
  
But, don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
But don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
Understand me, you-understand me, you-understand me, now understand me  
But don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
But don't you know I'm a two thousand man  
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all  
I'm a two thousand man, I'm a two thousand man  
I'm a two thousand man, I'm a two thousand man, yeah, two thousand
