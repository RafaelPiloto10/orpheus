All aboard in Montreal  
I heard the conductor call  
That old engine heaved a sigh  
Suitcases and shuffling feet  
I found my way to a windo seat  
I love to watch the world go by  
Made friends with a family  
Bound for Sault Ste Marie  
They said good bye at Sudbury Junction  
Guess I hated to see 'em go  
Thought about 'em as it started to snow  
Time stops for nothing or no one  
This train keeps rollin along  
From here to the great beyond  
black somke, pistons churn  
steel rails, big wheels turn  
This train keeps rolling along  
Across the endless plrairie land  
Mighty buffalo used to stand  
The Cree and the Blackfoot lived and died  
??? the Rockies, nestled in the trees,  
I fell in love with Lake Louise  
smiling with her sparkling emerald eyes  
Soon we'll reach the sea  
and there I'll stand  
With nothing but the blue between me and japan  
Now I'm at the end of the line,  
Out of track, out of time,  
Conductor makes his final round  
All the people and places past  
They went by just a little too fast  
How I wishI could've slowed this engine down.  
This train keeps rollin along  
From here to the great beyond  
black somke, pistons churn  
steel rails, big wheels turn  
This train keeps rolling along
