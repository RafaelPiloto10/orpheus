Although I know our love is going strong  
Little surprises kind of help it along  
We mustn't let our lives become routine  
Don't do anything we don't mean  
There is no limit on love at all  
It can always get better the deeper you fall  
I'm sure without that love we won't survive  
So come on and show itlet's keep it alive  
And we'll be making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me  
If we're to make each other satisfied  
Gotta keep on tryin'don't let it ride  
It all comes over in the morning kiss  
Don't do it like thatdo it like this  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me  
Make it so much better  
It is better better  
Make it so much better  
Make it better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Better better  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me
