Went to college, studied arts  
To be an artist make a start  
Studied hard, gettin' my degree  
But no one seemed to notice me  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
Tried cartoons and comic books  
Dirty postcards could have done  
Here was where the money laid  
Classic art has had it's day  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
Did adverts for T.V.  
Household shops and brands of tea  
Labels all around the cans  
Who want to be a painter man  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man  
La, la, la, la, la, la,  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,  
Painter man, painter man  
Who want to be a painter man
