1, 2, 3  
  
Straight off the plane to a new hotel  
Just touched down, you could never tell  
A big house party with a crowded kitchen  
People talk shh but we don't listen  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everwhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
5 foot something with the skinny jeans  
Don't look back, baby follow me  
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way  
Same old shh but a different day  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
You and me and all our friends  
I don't care how much we spend  
Baby, this is what the night is for,  
I know nothing's making sense  
For tonight let's just pretend  
I don't wanna stop so give me more  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
