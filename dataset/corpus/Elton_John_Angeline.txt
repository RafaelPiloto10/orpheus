Well, I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed  
So shut that door when the baby cries  
Keep me well fed, give me warm bread  
Lay my body on a feather bed  
And spoil me, Angeline, get to work  
When the whistle screams, Angeline  
Maybe someday, some way  
Somewhere in the future there's more pay  
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash  
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash  
And bite me, Angeline, let me use  
You like a sex machine, Angeline  
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card  
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard  
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans  
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean, Angeline  
Well, I talk tough, I act rough  
Lay still honey, I can't get enough  
And keep your nose clean, let me be  
On your knees when you speak to me  
And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty  
And I'll make you scream, Angeline  
You've got to swing that hammer and punch that card  
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard  
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans  
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean  
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card  
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard  
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans  
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean  
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean  
Angeline, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline  
Treat her mean, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline
