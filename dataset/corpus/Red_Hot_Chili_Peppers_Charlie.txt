All aboard, stitch in time  
Get yours, got mine  
In a minute, I'll be there  
Sit tight, get square  
You could do it at the hippodrome  
Slide back, trombone  
Anybody got a TV at home  
That's right, unknown  
  
When I pick up on that smell  
Pick it up and run like hell  
Little woman save me some  
Better get up on your run  
  
So much more than  
Charlie's wakin' me  
To my core and  
Charlie's shakin' me  
And tell my story  
And Charlie's makin' me  
And Charlie's makin' me smile  
Oh oh now  
  
Everybody, do the twist  
Get the message, on Flea's fist  
Move around like a scientist  
Lay down, get kissed  
Big picture and it never lies  
Big daddy, will advise  
Ever ready, in disguise  
Sunset, sunrise  
  
When I pick up on that smell  
Pick it up and run like hell  
Little woman save me some  
Better get up on your run  
  
So much more than  
Charlie's wakin' me  
To my core and  
Charlie's shakin' me  
And tell my story  
And Charlie's makin' me  
And Charlie's makin' me smile  
Oh oh now  
  
My heart, your skin  
This love, I'm in  
We don't arrive without a surprise  
You're right, I'm wrong  
Be free, belong  
Intimate sight has come in to light  
  
When I pick up on that smell  
Pick it up and run like hell  
Little woman save me some  
Better get up on your run  
  
All I ever wanted to  
Was pick it up and run with you  
Slip into a summer spell  
Double up and run like hell  
  
So much more than  
Charlie's wakin' me  
To my core and  
Charlie's shakin' me  
And tell my story  
And Charlie's makin' me  
And Charlie's makin' me smile  
Oh oh now
