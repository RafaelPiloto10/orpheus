There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground  
Makin' it shiver and shake  
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky  
Slippery and sly like a snake  
  
With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth  
A shadow has covered the light  
Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade  
Has shattered the edge of the night  
  
I know she waits below  
Only to rise on command  
When she comes for me  
She's got my life in her hands  
  
When a movement behind hit the side of my mind  
I trembled and shook it away  
Then another assault and I started to falter  
Fibers of steel turned to clay  
  
With a bubbly turn now the water should churn  
And push it way from the core  
And a lady in white will bring sun to the night  
Brighter than ever before  
  
I know she waits below  
Only to rise on command  
When she comes for me  
She's got my life in her hands  
Lady of the lake  
  
There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground  
Makin' it shiver and shake  
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky  
Slippery and sly like a snake  
  
With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth  
A shadow has covered the light  
Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade  
Has shattered the edge of the night  
  
Straight down I'm swirling around  
Blinded and bruised by the strain  
There must be some way to see  
Diamonds out of the rain  
  
I know she waits below  
Only to rise on command  
When she comes for me  
She's got my life in her hands  
Lady of the lake
