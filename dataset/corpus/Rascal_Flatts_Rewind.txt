Wish I could reach up and reset that sun  
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up  
Went by so fast oh so sweet  
Make me wanna remake a memory  
Wish I had me a time machine  
  
Oh I float the moon back up in the sky  
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind  
  
I turn back that radio dial reopen your door,  
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore  
Re-spin you around replay that sound of you laughing when we hit the ground,  
I can see it now how bout we  
  
Float the moon back up in the sky, put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind  
  
I wanna re-fall and re- fly  
Baby re-live this night  
  
Float the moon back up in the sky, put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind
