Whoa! My love, my darling,  
I hunger for your touch,  
Alone. Lonely time.  
And time goes by, so slowly,  
And time can do so much,  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love.  
I need your love.  
God speed your love to me.  
  
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,  
To the open arms of the sea.  
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me,  
I'll be coming home, wait for me.  
  
Whoa! My love, my darling,  
I hunger, hunger!, for your love,  
For love. Lonely time.  
And time goes by, so slowly,  
And time can do so much,  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love.  
I need your love.  
God speed your love to me.
