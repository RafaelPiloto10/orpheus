See the flowers round the altar  
See the peaches in tins 'neath the headmaster's chair  
Harvest festival  
  
See the two who've been chosen  
See them walk hand in hand to the front of the hall  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
See the children with baskets  
See their hair cut like corn neatly combed in their rows  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs  
The longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
What a year when the exams and crops all failed  
Of course you passed but you were never seen again  
We all grew and we got screwed and cut and nailed  
Then out of nowhere invitation in gold pen  
  
See the flowers round the altar  
See that you too got married and I wish you well  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs  
The longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
Harvest festival
