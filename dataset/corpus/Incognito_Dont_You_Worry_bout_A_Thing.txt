(s. wonder)  
  
Everybody's got a thing  
But some don't know how to handle it  
Always reachin' out in vain  
Just taking the things not worth havin'  
  
  
  
Chorus:  
But don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (don't you worry, baby)  
'cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
  
They say your style of life's a drag  
And that you must go other places  
Just don't you feel too bad  
When you get fooled by smiling faces  
  
Chorus  
  
When you get off your trip  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody needs a change  
A chance to check out the new  
You're the only one who see  
The changes you take yourself through  
  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (sweet baby)  
'cause I'll be standin' in the wings when you check it out  
  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry 'cause I'll be right here waitin' for
you baby  
Repeat (fade)
