Standing at the crossroads, world spinning round and round  
Know which way I'm going, you can't bring me down  
Don't you try and teach me no original sin  
I don't need your pity for the shape I'm in  
  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
  
Tell me I'm a sinner I got news for you  
I spoke to God this morning and he don't like you  
You telling all the people the original sin  
He says he knows you better than you'll ever know him  
  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
  
You know it ain't easy  
You know it ain't fair  
So don't try to please me  
Because I really don't care  
  
Don't tell me stories 'cause yesterday's glories  
Have gone away, so far away  
I've heard it said there's a light up ahead  
Lord I hope and pray I'm here to stay  
  
Tell me I'm a sinner I got news for you  
I spoke to God this morning and he don't like you  
Don't you try and teach me no original sin  
I don't need your pity for the shape I'm in  
  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me  
I don't wanna change the world  
I don't want the world to change me
