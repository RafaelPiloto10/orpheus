Superman can fly high way up in the sky  
'Cause we believe he can  
So what we choose to believe can always work out fine  
It's all in the mind  
So think of a place and imagine a time  
And let's go be lovers  
  
Believing me, Ooo Wee baby  
Is believing right-oh yeah, and  
  
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl  
So make me a believer  
Wanna love you girl  
  
Ooo so near  
And forever keep you here  
Forget all about whatever we fear  
And let's just be lovers  
Loving and loving, oh love is the way  
To make me stay  
  
I know the way to persuade me over to your side  
And I am sure you can  
So if you get me to believe  
It all will work out fine  
'Cause you'll blow my mind  
So let's pick a place, a day, and a time  
And then we'll be lovers  
Loving and loving, oh love is the way  
To make me stay
