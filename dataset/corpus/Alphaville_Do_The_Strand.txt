There's a new sensation, a fabulous creation  
A danceable solution to teenage revolution  
Do the strand, love, when you feel love  
It's the new way, that's why we say  
Do the strand  
Do it on the tables, Quaglino's place or Mabel's  
Slow and gentle, sentimental  
All styles served here, Louis seize he prefers  
Laissez-faire le Strand  
Tired of the tango, fed up with Fandango  
Dance on moonbeams, slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans, you know what i mean  
Do the strand  
  
We're playing our tune by the pale moon  
We're incognito down the Lido  
And we like the strand  
Had your fill of quadrilles, the madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the beguine, the samba isn't your scene  
If you feel blue look through who's who  
See La Goulue and Nijinsky  
Do the strandsky  
Weary of the waltz, mashed potato schmaltz  
The Sphinx and Mona Lisa, Lolita and Guernica  
Rhododendron is a nice flower  
Evergreen it lasts forever  
But it can't beat the strand power  
Do the strand
