When the big gun starts to shooting  
With their bullets of deception  
With the smile upon your face  
Going from second hand to almost new  
  
Show me one more sign  
Give me one more time  
'Cause you give me  
You give me temptation  
  
Sing along sing along baby  
Sing along for the love of the children  
  
And if this was to be true  
Say I'd give all the tea in China  
And maybe all the tulips  
In Amsterdam  
  
Well I try to live life eye to eye  
But I say I find it far too tall  
  
Show me one more sign  
Give me one more time  
'Cause you give me  
You give me temptation  
  
First you make me move  
Until I'm so damn close  
Take me back again, take me back again  
Say I'm mighty thankful  
But it's much too easy  
Paying dues and learning vices  
But no, but no, but oh no  
You won't waste my spirit  
  
Show me one more sign  
Give me one more time  
'Cause you give me  
You give me temptation  
  
I want peace love and understanding  
To last throughout my life  
  
Sing along sing along baby  
Sing along for the love of the children
