Who do you think you're talkin' to  
You know me and I know you  
Your silence and your stony face  
You don't have the ground to waste  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
What can we say when all is said  
A house divided cannot stand  
Your head and heart and chary gaze  
Life is just too short to waste  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind  
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
What can we do when all is done  
Your life's not the only one  
Just take a look beyond yourself  
The reason of your private hell  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind  
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you
