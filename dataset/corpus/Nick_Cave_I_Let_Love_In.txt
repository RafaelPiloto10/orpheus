Despair and Deception, Love's ugly little twins  
Came a-knocking on my door, I let them in  
Darling, you're the punishment for all of my former sins  
I let love in  
I let love in  
The door it opened just a crack, but Love was shrewed and bold  
My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold  
A life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
Well I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized  
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized  
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
O Lord, tell me what I done  
Please don't leave me here alone  
Where are my friends?  
My friends are gone  
O Lord, tell me what I done  
Please don't leave me here alone  
Where are my friends?  
My friends are gone  
I let love in  
I let love in  
So if you're sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at you door  
And the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned  
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in
