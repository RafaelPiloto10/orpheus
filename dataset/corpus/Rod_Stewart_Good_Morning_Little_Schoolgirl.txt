Good morning little schoolgirl  
Good morning little schoolgirl  
Can I come home with  
Can I come home with you  
Tell your mama and your papa  
I once was a schoolboy too  
  
Sometimes I don't know what  
Sometimes I don't know what  
What in the world  
What in the world to do  
Oh I don't want to hurt your feelings  
Or even get mad at you  
At all  
  
I'm gonna buy me an airplane  
I'm gonna buy me an airplane  
Fly right over  
Fly right over town  
If I don't find my baby  
Ain't gonna put my airplane down  
  
Good morning little schoolgirl  
Good morning little schoolgirl  
Can I come home with  
Can I come home with you  
Tell your mama and your papa  
I once was a schoolboy too
