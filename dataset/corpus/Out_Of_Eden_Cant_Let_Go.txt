Right now, I think it's time it be known  
just how I feel about you, father savior.  
I'm sure that you see what's in my heart,  
but just vision is not enough I've gotta tell you.  
More than tell you, anyone can say the words.  
I want to be the one to tell you how I feel.  
You're too much, more than I could know.  
Just my way to say I can't let go of you.  
  
Chorus:  
I can't let go of you  
no matter what the world may tell me.  
Oh,oh, I can't let go of you  
no matter what the world may tell me.  
  
Right now, you are all that I am.  
It's not I, but it's you that liveth in me.  
Where would I be if you ever were to go?  
But I know that you'll never leave me nor forsake me.  
You've brought me into so much light.  
You've kept me safe even at times I've left your side.  
What would I do if I weren't saved by you?  
Can't even imagine that's why I can't let go of you.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
You've brought me into so much light.  
You've kept me safe even at times I've left your side.  
What would I do if I weren't saved by you?  
Can't even imagine that's why I can't let go of you.  
  
Repeat Chorus
