When the sun goes down on the other side of town tonight  
And the world is asleep dreamin' in the deep moonlight  
I'll slip away in the shadows out of your life  
You don't want' me anymore so I'll close the door when I leave  
My bags are packed and I'll give you back your keys  
You keep your ring and I'll keep your memory  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
Well, it's hard to take when love breaks down and dies  
But it's better to quit than to sit each night and cry  
I'd rather know the truth than to live through a life of lies  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
Maybe it's for the best to give this love of ours a rest  
But I'll come runnin' back if you want me  
Well, bye bye baby it seems that we're all through  
You sure know how make this little girl blue  
When you say you don't want the things I can do for you  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
In my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams
