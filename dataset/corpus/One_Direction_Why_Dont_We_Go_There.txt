I know you want, know you wanna take it slow  
Think about all the places we could go  
If you give in tonight  
Just let me set you free  
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Say the word, say the word but don't say no  
Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes  
The secret's safe with me  
There's no right time or place  
'Cause anyone can see we'll do it anyway  
  
'Cause we got all night  
We're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away  
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah  
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high  
I wanna be addicted, don't say no  
Just let go  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
With me, with me  
Why don't you go there with me?
