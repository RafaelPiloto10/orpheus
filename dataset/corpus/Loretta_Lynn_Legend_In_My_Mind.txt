You're a memory of love I've been unable to leave behind  
All for the hurt that don't ease up the way I hope it would givin' time  
It slowly been so long I'm not surprised to find that you're a legend in my
mind  
You're a picture of yesterday and the shadow that hides the sun  
Lonely words that still echo when the echo should be gone  
You're the livin' part of me the only part it leaves behind  
And you're a legend in my mind  
If I had the way to close every doors  
That you ever open wide and I walk through with you  
I could fuss the world on the back and carry away and never come back to you  
I wish that I could close my eyes and see you gone I'm not blind I'm not blind  
And you're a legend in my mind  
I wish that I could close my eyes...
