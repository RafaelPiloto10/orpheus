Ohh, ahh  
If I laid all alone  
Tossin, turning  
Longing for some of your tender love  
I'm wishing for the right moment to come  
So I can give you all,  
All the tender love youve given to me  
Oh baby  
  
Tender love (tender love)  
Love so sweet  
Hold me close  
Oh baby I surrender (oh baby I surrender)  
Candles they light the dark, yes  
(now I see how)  
All the tender love youve given to me  
And I want you more and more, babe  
(can't resist you)  
Oh and I feel your touch  
Tender love  
  
And you're loving me straight from the heart  
(hold me nearer)  
Reasons beyond our love  
All the tender love youve given to me  
(all of your love, baby)  
Tender love (tender love)  
Love so sweet  
Hold me close  
Oh baby I surrender (oh baby I surrender)  
Candles they light the dark, yes  
(now I see how)  
All the tender love youve given to me  
And I want you more and more, babe  
(can't resist you)  
Oh and I feel your touch  
Tender love  
Tender love (tender love)  
Love oh, so tender  
Hold me,  
Close to you  
Girl, I surrender  
Chorus  
Tender love (tender love)  
Love so tender, baby  
Hold me close  
Hold me close  
Hold me close to you,  
I surrender  
Tender love (tender love)  
Tender love  
Tender love, give me some of that tender love  
Tender love,  
Tender love
