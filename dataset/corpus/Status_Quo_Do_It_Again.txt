If you ever found anything better than working  
You'd want to do it again  
Like flying a plane or nude body surfing  
You'd want to do it again  
That Casanova he had it right  
He'd just do it again  
He'd do it again all day and all night  
Then he'd do it again  
  
You gonna drink too much say never no more  
But you're gonna do it again  
Trust me I'm a doctor I know for sure  
You're gonna do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
Me I get time off I twiddle my thumbs  
'cause I want to do it again  
I get a rush every night when 8.45 comes  
Can't wait to do it again  
There is a price to pay, it ain't cheap  
If you want to do it again  
But I sold my soul yeah I'm in deep  
Might as well do it again  
  
Life is short, never complain  
You could be hit by a truck, fall under a train  
Enjoying yourself is the name of the game  
Gotta go back tonight and do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
That Mona Lisa now she could smile  
And do it again  
She'd sit and grin for quite a while  
Then she'd do it again  
You is here then you ain't, that was never in doubt  
Better do it again  
Don't take no Einstein to work it out  
So do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again
