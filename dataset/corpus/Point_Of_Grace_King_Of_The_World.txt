Spinning around on the tops of his feet  
Smiles of the angels could not be so sweet  
Wide blue eyes  
And picky-tails swirl  
She's her daddys' girl  
'Cause he knows the jokes that always make her laugh  
He takes her for ice cream instead of her nap  
At the end of the day by the light of the moon  
They turn up the music and there in the room  
  
And she yells  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
  
It's funny how life moves in circles at times  
To think not so long ago that fase was mine  
Houses get smaller we take different names  
But some things in life stay the same  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
  
'Cause some day she'll go off and find a life of her own  
Marry a good man  
And make a happy home  
Until she comes back and sees with those same eyes  
What time can not diskise  
  
She walks through the door with that look on her face  
Cause daddys' brown hair has all turned to gray  
They talk for hours they cry and they laugh  
Watchin' old movies and thinkin' back  
And just as she turns to go  
She says, "hey dad, how bout 1 for the road"  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch DOWN!  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
Oh no there's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
King of the world  
  
Spinning around on the tops of his feet  
Smiles of the angels could not be so sweet.
