Cut yourself in conversation  
Cut the line to make me feel alive  
'Cause you know I'm not alive  
  
And leave me with your complications  
Take your life, you feel like taking mine  
Meeting god we stand in line, not alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing  
Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
Trust you'll take the right to leave me  
Waiting under dark clouds for the rain  
Praying lightning strikes a change  
As history gets lost and  
As I took that final breath I felt alive  
Meeting god to stand in line, all alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing  
Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
Don't let me go, don't say good bye  
'Cause you know that I'm not alive  
Don't let me go, don't say good bye  
Don't let this love die  
Don't let me go, don't say good bye  
(Cut yourself in conversation  
Cut the line to make me feel alive)  
'Cause you know that I'm not alive  
Don't let me go, don't say good bye  
(And leave me with your complications  
Take your life, you feel like taking mine)  
Don't let this love die  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing  
Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
I'm not kissing you goodbye
