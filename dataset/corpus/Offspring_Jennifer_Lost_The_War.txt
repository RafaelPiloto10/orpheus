Jennifer lost the war today  
You'll find her burned and raped  
Through it all  
She must have wondered  
What have I done  
But nobody really cares today  
The world's a busy place  
Guess she must have really sinned  
  
I guess we're all just soldiers  
She was only six years old  
Left to die by strangers  
Her family waits  
And if we're all just soldiers  
Is it so wrong to be afraid  
  
Phoebe lost the war today  
There must be some mistake  
Say it happens all the time  
And it's said and done  
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed  
Guess you must have really sinned  
  
Morality won't help her  
When she lies silent in a morgue  
And all our sorrows just don't count at all  
But will the morning headlines  
Even say that it's a shame  
What are we headin' for  
  
Seen it all before  
Silent on the ground  
As he's walking away  
And I wonder how many more  
Everybody takes it  
Like it's nothing at all  
Jennifer lost the war
