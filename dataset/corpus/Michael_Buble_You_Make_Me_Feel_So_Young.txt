You make me feel so young  
You make me feel as though spring has sprung  
And every time I see you grin  
I'm such a happy individual  
  
The moment that you speak  
I wanna go play hide and seek  
I wanna go and bounce the moon  
Just like a toy balloon  
  
You and I are just like a couple of tots  
Runnin' across the meadow  
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots  
  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung  
And a wonderful spring to be sprung  
And even when I'm old and grey  
I'm gonna feel the way I do, today  
'Cause you make me feel so young  
  
You make me young  
You make me feel as though spring has sprung  
And every time I see you grin  
I'm such a happy individual  
  
The moment that you speak  
I wanna go play hide and seek  
I wanna go and bounce at the moon  
Like a big balloon  
  
Because, you and I are just like a couple of tots  
Runnin' across the meadow  
Grabbing up all  
  
You make me up  
You make me feel there are songs to be sung  
Lots of bells to be rung  
And a wonderful fling to be flung  
And even when I'm old and gray  
I'm gonna feel the way i do today  
Cause you make me feel so  
Man i just feel so  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel so young  
So young  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel so young
