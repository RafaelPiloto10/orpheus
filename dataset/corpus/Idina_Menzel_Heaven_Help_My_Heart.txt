If it were love  
I would give that love  
Every second I had  
And I do  
  
Did I know where he'd lead me to  
Did I plan  
Doing all of this  
For the love of a man  
  
Well I let it happen anyhow  
And what I'm feeling now  
Has no easy explanation  
Reason plays no part  
  
Heaven help my heart  
  
I love him too much is  
What if he das my whole existence  
Turning around a word a smile  
  
One of these days  
And it won't be long  
He'll know more about me  
Than he should  
All my dreams will be understood  
  
No surprise  
Nothing more to learn  
From the look in my eyes  
Don't you know that time is not my friend  
I'll fight it to the end  
Hoping to keep that best of moments  
When the passions start  
  
Heaven help my heart  
  
The day that I find  
Suddenly I've run out of secrets  
Suddenly I'm not always on his mind  
  
Maybe it's best to love a stranger  
Well...  
That's what I've done  
Heaven help my heart  
  
Heaven help my heart
