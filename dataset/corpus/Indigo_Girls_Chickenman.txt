I am an only child  
Born of the wild  
Riddled to spend my time  
Defending my land  
You are the only one  
Born in the sun  
Riddled to spend your time  
Defending my plan  
Dead dog on the highway  
Median cats are growling at me  
I turn my lights on brighter  
I'm counting through the night ride  
And it's one more life  
(For the taker)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
One more song  
(For the maker)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
On the road to Athens  
I saw a dead deer on the highway  
I slipped into a desert  
Five prairie dogs and a rabbit  
I was running down on Queen Street  
I saw a woman on the sidewalk  
(Danger danger)  
She was beaten by a stranger  
(Danger danger danger danger)  
Danger danger danger  
And it's one more life  
(For the taker)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
One more song  
(For the maker)  
Hold my hand  
Chickenman  
I was on the road to Austin  
Met a man on the highway  
He sold me junk and conversation  
He was wise and dirty from the weather  
I said, "Darkness into darkness  
All the carnage of my journeys  
Makes it harder to be living"  
He said, "It's a long road to be forgiven"  
It's one more life  
(For the taker)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
Chickenman hold my had  
One more song  
(For the maker)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
I am an only child  
Born of the wild  
Riddled to spend my time  
Defending my land  
You are the only one  
Born in the sun  
Riddled to spend your time  
Defending my plan  
I went looking for a car  
Found myself beneath the stars  
I went looking for a girl  
Found a man and his world  
Chickenman, chickenman  
(I went looking for a car)  
Chickenman hold my hand  
(Found myself beneath the stars)  
Chickenman, chickenman  
(I went looking for a girl)  
Chickenman hold my hand  
(Found a man and his world)  
I am an only child  
(Chickenman, chickenman)  
(Chickenman hold my hand)  
Hold my hand  
(Chickenman, chickenman)  
(Chickenman hold my hand)  
I am an only child  
(Chickenman, chickenman)  
(Chickenman hold my hand)  
Hold my hand  
(Chickenman, chickenman)  
(Chickenman hold my hand)  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand
