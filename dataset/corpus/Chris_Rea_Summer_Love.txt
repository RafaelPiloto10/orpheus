Once there was a summer love  
Long ago and far away  
The autumn whispers to the falling leaves  
Summer love can't stay  
  
This was their place, this was where  
Just for one moment, without cares  
Two lovers dreaming of how the world should be  
Please bring back my summer love to me  
  
Did you have to go, did I have to stay  
Did you have to go, away  
Now it's all gone, but who can forget  
Summer love, sweet summer love  
  
I see your shadow everywhere  
I feel your smile though you're not there  
A kiss for every star in the sky way above  
You'll always be my one and only summer love
