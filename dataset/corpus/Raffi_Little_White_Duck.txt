There's a little white duck sitting in the water  
Little white duck doing what he oughta  
He took a bite of a lily pad  
Flapped his wings and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little white duck sitting in the water  
Quack, quack, quack  
  
There's a little green frog swimming in the water  
Little green frog doing what he oughta  
He jumped right off of the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little green frog swimming in the water  
Gulp, gulp, gulp  
  
There's a little black bug floating on the water  
A little black bug doing what he oughta  
He tickled the frog on the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little black bug floating on the water  
Quick, quick, quick  
  
There's a little red snake lying in the water  
A little red snake doing what he oughta  
He frightened the duck and the frog so bad  
And he ate the little bug and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little red snake lying in the water  
Sss, sss, sss  
  
And now there's nobody left left sitting in the water  
Nobody left doing what he oughta  
Nothing left but the lily pad  
The duck and the frog ran away  
There's nobody left sitting in the water  
Boo, hoo, hoo  
  
Because of the snake that ate the bug  
That tickled the frog, that went kerchug  
There's nobody left to sing about alas and alak  
Not even the little white duck  
Quack, quack, quack, quack
