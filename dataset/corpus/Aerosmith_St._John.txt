(Come on boy, the tape is rollin')  
(One, two, one two, two two two)  
John was bad  
He gave it everything he had  
John he prayed  
For all the people ever made  
John was cool  
He never did no after school  
Late at night when he praised the Lord  
He laid his hands down upon the bloody sword  
John, St John be cool  
Tell the people  
They follow you  
They follow you  
But every night when he praised the Lord  
He laid his hands down upon the bloody sword  
Lay down upon the sword  
Lay down upon the sword  
Lay down upon the sword  
Lay down your bloody sword  
John, St John be cool  
Tell the people  
They follow you  
John, St John be cool  
Tell the people  
They follow you  
Late at night when he praised the Lord  
He lay his hands down upon the bloody sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Down, down upon the sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Gettin' down upon the sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Laid it down upon the sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Late night TV roared
