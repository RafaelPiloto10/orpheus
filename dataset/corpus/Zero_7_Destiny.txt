I lie awake  
I've gone to ground  
I'm watching porn  
In my hotel dressing gown  
Now I dream of you  
But I still believe  
There's only enough for one in this  
Lonely hotel suite  
  
The journey's long  
And it feels so bad  
I'm thinking back to the last day we had  
Old moon fades into the new  
Soon I know I'll be back with you  
I'm nearly with you  
I'm nearly with you  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
On a clear day  
I'll fly home to you  
I 'm bending time getting back to you  
Old moon fades into the new  
Soon I know I'll be back with you  
I'm nearly with you  
I'm nearly with you  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
I'll fly, I'll fly home  
I'll fly home and I'll fly home
