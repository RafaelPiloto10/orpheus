Things got rough  
Things got tough  
Things got harder than hard  
We were just trying to make a livin'  
In our back yard  
We were born too late died to soon  
Anxiety's a terrible crime  
If you don't come now don't come at all  
'cause it's a crooked piece of time.  
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in  
A crooked piece of time  
All in all and all in all  
It's a crooked piece of time.  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came  
Blew your picture  
Right out of the picture frame  
Even blew the candle out  
From underneath the flame  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came.
