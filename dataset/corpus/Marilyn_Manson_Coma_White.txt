Something is cold and blank behind her smile  
She's standing on an overpass  
In her miracle mile  
  
'Cause You were from a perfect world  
A world that threw me away today  
Today, today, to run away  
  
A pill to make you numb  
A pill to make you dumb  
A pill to make you anybody else  
But all the drugs in this world  
Won't save her from herself  
  
Her mouth was an empty cut  
And she was waiting to fall  
Just bleeding like a Polaroid that  
Lost all her dolls  
  
You were from a perfect world  
A world that threw me away today  
Today, today, to run away  
  
A pill to make you numb  
A pill to make you dumb  
A pill to make you anybody else  
But all the drugs in this world  
Won't save her from herself  
  
A pill to make you numb  
A pill to make you dumb  
A pill to make you anybody else  
But all the drugs in this world  
Won't save her from herself  
  
You were from a perfect world  
A world that threw me away today  
  
A pill to make you numb  
A pill to make you dumb  
A pill to make you anybody else  
But all the drugs in this world  
Won't save her from herself  
  
A pill to make you numb  
A pill to make you dumb  
A pill to make you anybody else  
But all the drugs in this world  
Won't save her from herself
