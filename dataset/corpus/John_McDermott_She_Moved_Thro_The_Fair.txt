My young love said to me  
"My mother won't mind  
And my father won't slight you  
For your lack of kind"  
And she stepp'd away from me  
And this she did say  
"It will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day"  
  
She stepp'd away fromme  
And went through the fair  
And fondly I watch'd her  
Move here and move there  
And then she went homeward  
With one star awake  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the lake  
  
The people were saying  
That no two e'er were wed  
And one had a sorrow  
That never was said  
And I smiled as she passed  
With her goods and her gear  
And that was the last  
That I saw my dear  
  
Last night she came to me  
She came softly in  
So softly she came  
That her feet made no din  
And she placed her hand on me  
And this she did say  
"Oh it will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day"
