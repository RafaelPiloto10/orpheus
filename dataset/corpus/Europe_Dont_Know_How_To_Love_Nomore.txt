I need you here tonight  
Your body next to mine  
I haven't seen you for a while  
I need your tender kiss  
The touch of your fingertips  
I haven't seen you for some time now  
I need to touch you like I used to do before  
Though I have touched you girl a million times or more  
I don't know how to love no more  
I don't know what I'm waiting for  
Take it to your heart my friend and teach me how to love again  
I don't know how to cry no more  
So tell me what I'm living for  
Take it to your heart my friend and teach me how to love again  
Yeah, teach me  
I need you here tonight  
To squeeze and hold you tight  
And feel your skin so close to mine  
I wonder where you are  
So near but yet so far  
Your name is always on my mind  
I need to touch you like I used to do before...  
I don't know how to love no more...  
Come on, teach me  
Yeah, teach me  
Come on and teach me  
I need you here tonight...  
I've been longing for some time now  
I need to touch you like I used to do before...  
Come on and teach me  
I don't know how to love no more...  
I don't know how to love no more  
No, I don't know what I'm waiting for  
I don't know how to cry no more  
No, I don't know how to love no more
