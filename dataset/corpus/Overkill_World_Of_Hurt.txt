Aggravation, fuelin' me,  
Money powered, hypocrisy.  
I have no feelings, you're much the same.  
We have no feelings, we feel no pain!  
  
I am numb to all I see,  
This the way it has to be,  
Gone is hope, gone is need,  
I know! stone don't bleed.  
  
What's it worth? if I die.  
What's the reason? they all cry.  
I have no feelings, too much the same,  
Not my problem, I feel no blame.  
  
We are blind and we are cold,  
We're afraid of growing old.  
We are numb to all we see,  
Nothing sacred.  
  
Backs turned to madness,  
Backs to misery and I put the,  
Brush to the canvas!  
An' paint a world!  
Paint my world of:  
  
Hurt!  
World of hurt. Of hurt.  
  
We are blind and we are cold,  
Still afraid of growing old.  
We are numb to all we see,  
Nothing sacred.  
  
Hurt!!!  
Paints my world of hurt.  
Paints my world, in my world of!  
In my world of hurt!!!
