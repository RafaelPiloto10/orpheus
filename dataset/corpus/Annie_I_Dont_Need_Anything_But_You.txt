Warbucks and annie  
  
Together at last!  
Together for ever!  
We're tying a knot,  
They never can sever!  
  
Warbucks  
  
I don't need sunshine now,  
To turn my skies at blue --  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
I don't need anything but you!  
  
Warbucks  
  
You've wrapped me around  
That cute little finger.  
You've made life a song.....  
You've made me the singer!  
  
Annie  
  
And what's the bathtub tune  
You always "Bu-Bu-Boo?"  
  
Warbucks  
  
Bu-Bu-Bu  
Anything but you  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
You can say that again  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
But that's  
  
Annie  
  
Not now  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
That's then  
  
Annie  
  
I'm poor as a mouse,  
  
Warbucks  
  
I'm richer than Midas.  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
But nothing on earth  
Could ever divide us!  
And if tomorrow, I  
'm an apple seller, too--  
I don't need anything but you!  
  
Servants  
  
All  
  
Annie Annie  
You filled our life with a song  
  
They're two of a kind  
The happiest pair now  
Like Fred and Adelle, they're floating  
On air now  
And what's the title of the dream that just came true  
  
Warbucks  
  
I don't need anything  
  
Annie  
  
Anything  
  
All  
  
Anything  
I don't need anything  
But you
