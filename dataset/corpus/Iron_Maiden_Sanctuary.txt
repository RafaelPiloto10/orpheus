Out of the winter came a war horse of steel  
I've never killed a woman before, but I know how it feels  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive  
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive  
I know you'd gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
  
I can laugh at the wind, I can howl at the rain.  
Down in the canyon or out in the plain.  
  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight
