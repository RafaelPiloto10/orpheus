Can you help me  
Help me get out of this place  
Slow sedation  
Ain' t my style ain' t my face  
Givin? Me a number  
Nine, seven, eight  
  
Gimme back my name  
  
Crazy  
But I don' t think that I can see  
You can hear them  
Only talkin? At me  
Livin? On the outside  
Lookin? Inside to be free  
  
Feel so good for awhile  
You don' t know why  
Cry while you lie  
You are true... You are true... You are true  
  
Save me  
Is there nothing that I can use  
Please believe me  
Am I conforming to your views  
Promise you anything  
Watch me cryin? Out to you  
  
Gimme back my name  
Let me make my statement

Crazy..... Crazy..... Crazy..... Crazy  
Crazy..... A suitable case for treatment  
Crazy, crazy...... Just a suitable case for treatment  
Crazy, crazy  
Crazy.... Crazy..... Crazy...... Etc.
