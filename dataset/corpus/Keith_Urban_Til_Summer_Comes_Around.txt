Another long summer's come and gone  
I don't know why it always ends this way  
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides  
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight  
  
But I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you promised you'd be back again  
And so I wander 'round this town  
'Til summer comes around  
  
I got a job working at the old park pier  
And every summer now for five long years  
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks  
And I count the days til you just might come back  
  
And then I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you swore you'd be back again  
And so I'm frozen in this town  
'Til summer comes around  
And it comes around  
  
And I close my eyes and you and I  
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel rocking with the motions  
And Hand in hand we cried and laughed  
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment  
And "Baby I'll be back again" you whispered in my ear  
But now the winter wind is the only sound  
And everything is closing down  
'Til summer comes around  
'Til summer comes around  
'Til it comes around  
And it comes around
