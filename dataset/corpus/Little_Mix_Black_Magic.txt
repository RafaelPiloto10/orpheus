[Intro: All]  
All the girls on the block knocking at my door  
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more  
  
[Verse 1: Perrie]  
Is your lover playing on your side?  
Said he loves you, but he ain't got time  
Here's the answer, come and get it  
At a knocked down price  
  
Hey  
  
[Verse 2: Jade]  
Full of honey just to make him sweet  
Crystal balling just to help him see  
What he's been missing, so come and get it  
While you've still got time  
  
Hey  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]  
Get your boy on his knees  
And repeat after me, say  
  
[Chorus: All]  
Take a sip of my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love  
For a spell that can't be broken, one drop should be enough  
Boy, you belong to me  
I got the recipe and it's called black magic  
And it's called black magic  
Take a sip of my secret potion, one taste and you'll be mine  
It's a spell that can't be broken and'll keep you up all night  
Boy, you belong to me  
I got the recipe and it's called black magic  
And it's called black magic  
  
[Verse 3: Jesy]  
If you're looking for Mr. Right  
Need that magic to change him over night  
Here's the answer, come and get it  
While you've still got time  
Hey  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]  
Get your boy on his knees  
And repeat after me, say  
  
[Chorus: All]  
Take a sip of my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love  
For a spell that can't be broken, one drop should be enough  
Boy, you belong to me  
I got the recipe and it's called black magic  
And it's called black magic  
Take a sip of my secret potion, one taste and you'll be mine  
It's a spell that can't be broken and'll keep you up all night  
Boy, you belong to me  
I got the recipe and it's called black magic  
And it's called black magic
