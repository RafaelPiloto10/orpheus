What a life it would be  
If you would come to mine for tea  
I'll pick you up at half past three  
And we'll have lasagna  
  
I'll treat you like a Queen  
I'll give you strawberries and cream  
And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna  
  
These could be the best days of our lives  
But I don't think we've been living very wise  
Oh no! no!  
What a life it would be  
  
If you would come to mine for tea  
I'll pick you up at half past three  
And we'll have lasagna  
These could be the best days of our lives  
  
But I don't think we've been living very wise  
Oh no! no!  
What a life it would be  
If you would come to mine for tea  
  
I'll pick you up at half past three  
And we'll have lasagna  
I'll treat you like a Queen  
I'll give you strawberries and cream  
  
And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna
