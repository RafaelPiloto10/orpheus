I want to love you, yeah, over and over again  
I want to see, see what you're like, like in bed, over and over  
Hey, hey, don't say goodnight  
When you know it's time for love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say goodnight  
Oh, when you know I gotta have your love  
  
I want to feel you, I want to thrill you girl  
I want to caress you, ooh  
Help undress you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And ooh baby, don't say goodnight  
When you know I gotta have your love  
Some people say that life is for the living  
So let's live it baby, yeah  
Most of the people say that love is for the giving  
So let me love you girl, yeah  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Some people say that life is for the living  
So let's live it baby, yeah  
Most of the people say that love is for the giving  
So let me love you girl, yeah  
And hey, baby, don't say goodnight, oh  
When you know I gotta have your love  
And hey, baby, don't you ever say goodnight  
Oh when you know I gotta have your love  
  
Ooh we babe, don't ever, ever say, don't ever, ever say  
Ever, ever, ever say  
Don't say goodnight, don't say goodnight
