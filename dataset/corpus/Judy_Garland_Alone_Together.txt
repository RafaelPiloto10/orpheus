Alone together, beyond the crowd  
Above the world  
We're not too proud to cling together  
We're strong as long as we're together  
  
Alone together, the blinding rain  
The starless nights were not in vain  
For we're together  
And what is there to fear together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather the great unknown  
If we're alone together, together, together  
If we're alone together
