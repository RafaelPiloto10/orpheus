Bet you never thought  
That time would go so fast  
Bet you never thought  
A memory would last  
Is it wrapped up in boxes  
With your fashion crazies  
Packed all away with life's scars and grazes  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you,  
Still remember you  
In my life  
Hey baby blue  
Where you running now,  
Where you running now  
In your own life  
  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
  
Everytime I saw your face  
There was magic in the air  
I see a sunny San Fransisco morning  
Baby you meet me there  
Sometimes I'm left wondering  
Sometimes it makes me so blue  
Let me take you down to Mexico  
'cause I'm still in love with you  
  
Every time I get to thinking,  
Thinking of you  
Under a sweet Corella  
Does it burn you too  
And if sometimes I wonder when,  
When sleep don't come at night  
I still move and I groove  
And I jump and shout  
Oh God I'm still in for the fight  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you  
Don't leave the world behind  
Leave the world,  
Leave the world behind  
  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you,  
Still remember you  
In my life  
Hey baby blue  
Where you running now,  
Where you running now  
In your own life
