[Spoken:]  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
  
  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
  
[Spoken:]  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' "come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine"  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all
