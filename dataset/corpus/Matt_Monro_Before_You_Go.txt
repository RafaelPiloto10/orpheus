Come to me  
Before you say goodbye  
Hold me close  
Before I start to cry  
  
I will miss you more  
Than you can ever know  
So kiss me once again  
Before you go  
  
I long with all my heart  
For you to stay with me  
But I know  
That this can never be  
  
Only yesterday  
You said we'd never part  
And now you leave me forsaken  
Along with this ache in my heart  
  
Though our love is an ember  
My darling remember  
I love you so  
  
Just kiss me once again  
Before you go  
Before you leave me now  
Before you go  
  
Though our love is an ember  
My darling remember  
I love you so  
  
Just kiss me once again  
Before you go  
Before you leave me now  
Before you go
