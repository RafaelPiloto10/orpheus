I saw you in a way  
But that's another life  
Maybe they're the same  
I wonder where you are  
Yesterday is gone  
But it ain't far away  
I guess it's far enough  
  
I'm older in my head  
My innocents is gone  
I have the book you read  
To help me carry on  
What a price to pay  
To feel like you're alive  
I was blind when he said  
  
It's all the same  
No matter where you are x3  
He said  
But he was wrong  
  
I'm your jezebel  
On my way to hell  
What a price to pay  
To feel like you're alive  
She was blind  
When she said  
  
It's all the same  
No matter where you are x3  
She said  
But she was wrong
