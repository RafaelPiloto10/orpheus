Here I am fallin' again, in places that I've already been.  
I sure didn't plan it and I don't understand it but here I am fallin' again.  
Here I am lyin' again making up places that I've never been.  
I thought I was through with these heart breaking blues but here I am lyin'
again.  
Why don't a man ever take time to think what is at stake?  
Is it the danger or the pleasurable stranger but those are the chances we'll
take.  
I'd hate to come face to face with her and her at the same place  
Cause it will be hell If I had to tell her someone has taken her place.  
  
I had a beautiful wife,she found it all out one night  
And the pleasurable stranger, lord I didn't change her and I lost it all this
time.  
So here I am cryin' again and callin' symphothy from my ole friends  
He once loved her and she once him and here I am cryin' again
