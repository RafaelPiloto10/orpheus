What if your brain,  
Unexpectedly and suddenly,  
Picked out things to flip around  
And view a lot differently?  
What if blue sky,  
All of a sudden turned a purple hue?  
We would shit a brick the size of all of it  
  
What if?  
What if I was just daydreaming?  
What if I lived in a pear?  
What if my watch read 4:20 every hour, every day?  
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy!  
I forgot to remember,  
I forgot to remember my pain.  
  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!  
What if mothballs,  
Hangin' around too close to microwaves  
Suddenly woke up and said,  
"Take me to your leader  
Or die by fly guy!  
He'll push ya' out,  
No wings attached!"  
Just do as I say, no mistake,  
He'll blow away.  
  
What if I was daydreaming?  
What if I lived in a pear?  
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber  
Tied to my leg and I  
Did not want my pants to get dirty?  
What if this, what if that?!  
Go! I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember my pain. Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!  
  
I forgot to remember my, pain!  
My pain!  
Forgot to inject my, cocaine!  
Forgot to apply my, rogaine!  
Forgot to remember, my pain!  
  
I never think, I never thought,  
Oh maybe I'm insane!  
I think I like being  
Way the fuck out of my brain!  
  
I forgot to remember,  
I forgot to remember my pain.  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!
