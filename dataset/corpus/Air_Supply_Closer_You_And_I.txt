Closer you and I  
Gino Padilla  
  
Hey, there's a look in your eyes  
Must be love at first sight  
You were just part of a dream  
Nothing more so it seemed  
But my love couldn't wait much longer  
Just can't forget the picture of your smile  
'Cause everytime I close my eyes you come alive  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
We'll be together  
Every little smile, that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
So we can get closer, you and I  
  
Then could I love you more  
So much stronger than before  
Why does it seem like a dream  
So much more so it seems  
I guess I found my inspiration  
With just one smile, you take my breath away  
So hold me close and say you'll stay with me now  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
We'll be together  
Every little smile, that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
So we can get closer, you and I
