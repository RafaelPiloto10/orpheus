I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold  
I'd rather be His than have riches untold  
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land  
I'd rather be led by His nail scarred hands  
  
Than to be the king of a vast domain  
Or be held in sin's dread sway  
I'd rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today  
  
I'd rather have Jesus than mens applause  
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause  
I'd rather have Jesus than world wide fame  
I'd rather be true to His holy name  
  
Than to be a king of the best domain  
Or be held in sin's dreads way  
I'd rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today
