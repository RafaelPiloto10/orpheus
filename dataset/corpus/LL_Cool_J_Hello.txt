[Chorus]  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Call me on the telephone  
  
Whether, 2-1-2, or 7-1-8  
Or 9-1-4, I love it hardcore  
When it's over the phone, it's safe to do it raw  
Imaginary worlds we could both explore  
(Hello) Baby what you wearing right now?  
(Hot pants) My girl ain't around, let's get down  
And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap  
(I'm bouncing up and down with my shoulders back)  
(Nigga you like that?) You see I'm running up my bill  
Momma might hear me, but you just too ill  
I got your flicks lined up, stereo low  
Cherry flavored grease beneath my elbow  
If I was there what would you do? (I'd lay you on your back)  
(Ride or die daddy, and I love it like that)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans  
(Oh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens)  
(I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride 'til I'm sweating it)  
(I bet you I can make you cum first) Throw the bets in  
I'm a nasty nigga, made to order  
Kiss below the border with a warm glass of water  
Is you wit me? (Yeah) Tell me how it taste  
I promise I'll keep the telephone right in my face  
How it feel? (Feels good) Where you at? (In the hood)  
(Talking on the phone like a good girl should)  
(To my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak)  
Strawberry shortcake, good enough to eat  
(And I taste mad sweet) We big freaks  
Blasting off on the phone seven days a week  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet  
To make sure your ex-man can't compete  
Shower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil  
G-string sitting like a snake in a coil  
(Hold on, I think somebody on the other line)  
Interrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind  
Lay back, imagine us chest to chest  
Tongue-kissing deep while we spark a sess  
(Everything is crazy, L do it the best)  
Riding rough baby, put my pipe to the test  
(On the telephone?) Yeah, this is the ill zone  
I want to make you moan until it's a dial tone  
However you want it baby, I'm raw to the bone  
Three (three) two (two) one (one) telephone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, know what I'm saying? Word up, that's what I'm talking about  
All you gotta do is hit me, word, I'll call you right back  
Yeah, ? move this out  
What you want me right now  
You goin' make me crash or something, word up  
It's that real shit
