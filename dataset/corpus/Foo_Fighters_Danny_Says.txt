Danny says we gotta go  
Gotta go to Idaho,  
But we can't go surfing  
'cause its 20 below  
  
Sound checks at 5 o' 2  
Record stores and interviews  
Oh but I can wait to be with you  
Tomorrow  
  
Baby oh oh oh  
We got nowhere to go  
And it may seem funny  
But it's true uhu uhuu  
  
Hanging out in 100 feet  
Watchin' get smart on TV  
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me  
  
Hangin' out in here  
Having nowhere to go o  
I ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow  
Listening to Sheena on the radio  
  
Danny says we gotta go  
Gotta go to Idaho  
But we can't go surfing  
Cause its 20 below  
  
Baby oh oh oh  
We got nowhere to go  
And it may seem funny  
But it's true uhu uhuu  
  
Hanging out in 100 feet  
Watchin' get smart on TV  
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me  
  
Uh uh uh uh
