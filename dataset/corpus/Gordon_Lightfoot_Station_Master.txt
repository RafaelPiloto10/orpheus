In the dawn's early light  
From a long and a sleepless night  
She returned again this morning  
From her long and restless flight  
And my red hollow eyes  
Did not show her much surprise  
As she lay right down beside me  
Like she never said goodbye  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
It was all I could bear  
Just to watch her lying there  
Disowned and ragged princess  
With the sun locked in her hair  
So cold, so frail  
With her mind locked in a jail  
The victim of confusion  
Never knowing she could fail  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
So I rocked her to sleep  
Then I got up on my feet  
And the day was filled with sunshine  
As I gazed across the street  
And the door seemed to say  
Over here, step this way  
The station is for travelers  
Even you must ride someday  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
Please help me station master  
Can I stay for just a while?  
Forgive me if I'm weary  
I ain't had much, much time to smile
