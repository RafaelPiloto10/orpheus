Come home to your place  
I've got a little while  
Till I've gotta leave  
You know there's been times  
Where I couldn't lie to your face  
But right now I'm looking at you  
Through the window of your soul  
I know those little dark holes are beautiful  
But I, I hear the words I should be saying  
I just wish that you could know  
I just think that you should know  
  
That your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I don't care if you're lost  
Or you're scared  
Or you never, ever  
Never, ever wanna be friends  
  
There's a small step outside your place  
I've got a little wine  
So I can taste all the bittersweet times  
That I have felt again  
But it's not too late to repair myself  
From the damage done  
Since I've been gone  
And I know  
I see the snow  
It starts to fall down  
I just think that I should go  
  
'Cause your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I don't care if you're lost  
Or you're scared  
Or you never, ever  
Never, ever wanna be friends  
  
Please, please belong here  
Please, please belong here  
Please, please belong here  
Belong here  
You love me, you love me  
  
'Cause your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I don't care if I get lost  
And I'll see you again [x2]
