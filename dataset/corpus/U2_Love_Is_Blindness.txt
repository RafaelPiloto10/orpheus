Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my heart  
Love is blindness  
  
In a parked car  
In a crowded street  
You see your love  
Made complete  
Thread is ripping  
The knot is slipping  
Love is blindness  
  
Love is clockworks  
And cold steel  
Fingers too numb to feel  
Squeeze the handle  
Blow out the candle  
Love is blindness  
  
Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love  
Blindness  
  
A little death  
Without mourning  
No call  
And no warning  
Baby, a dangerous idea  
That almost makes sense  
  
Love is drowning  
In a deep well  
All the secrets  
And no one to tell  
Take the money  
Honey  
Blindness  
  
Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love  
Blindness
