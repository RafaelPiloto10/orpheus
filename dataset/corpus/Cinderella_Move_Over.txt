You say that it's over baby  
You say that it's over now  
And still you hang around  
Now come on  
Won't you move over  
You know that I need a woman  
You know that I need a woman  
But when I ask you to  
You just tell me  
That maybe you can  
Please don't ya do it to me babe  
No  
Please don't ya do it to me  
Either take the love I offer  
Honey let me be  
I ain't quite ready for walking  
No, no, no  
Ain't quite ready for walking  
And what will you do with your love  
Love just dangle a little more  
Oh  
Make up your mind  
You're playin' the fool  
Make up your mind  
You're playin' the fool  
Now either be my lovin' heart  
Or honey let me be  
Let me be, let me be  
Oww  
Let me be  
You say that it's over baby  
You say that it's over now  
And still you hang around  
Now come on  
Won't you move over  
You know that I need a woman  
You know that I need a woman  
But when I ask you to  
You just tell me  
That maybe you can  
Please don't ya do it to me babe  
No  
Please don't ya do it to me  
Either take the love I offer  
Honey, let me be  
I said won't you, won't you let me be  
Honey, you're teasin' me  
Ya think you're playin' with my heart, dear  
I believe you're toyin' with my affections, honey  
I can't take no more  
And furthermore, I don't intend to  
You got my heart dangling from a string, babe  
You expect me to fight like I'm a goddamn mule
