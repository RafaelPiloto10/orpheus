I know I've just gotta get out of this place  
I can't stand any more of that mechanical grace  
Though you say it's only industrial squeeze  
It looks like luxury and feels like a disease  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh give it to me, give it to me  
I don't want to know much about much  
Give it to me, give it to me  
I need, I need, I need the human touch  
  
Left with just a house to hold  
Drinking your way to drydock  
It's easy to break up a model citizen  
Living in the state of shock  
  
I just can't believe I am responsible for this  
What the makeup hides can't be hidden with a kiss  
  
When I'm talking in tongues I go where you lead  
I don't make you plead, oh I need you  
How I'd like to fix her in a picture of rage  
How I'd like to catch her when she's acting her age  
But when she's laying stretched out on the floor  
It's no mystery to me anymore  
  
[Chorus]
