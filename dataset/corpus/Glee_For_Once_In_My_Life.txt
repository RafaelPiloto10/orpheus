For once in my life I have someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so long  
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me  
Somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Would make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before)  
For once, I have something I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)  
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I know I have love, I can make it  
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me  
  
Someone who needs me  
Someone who needs me  
  
For once in my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before)  
For once, I have something I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)  
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I know I have love, I can make it  
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me  
  
Someone who needs me  
For once in my life  
Someone who needs me  
Yea, somebody that needs me  
Someone who needs me  
For once in my life  
Someone who needs me  
Oh baby, for once in my life
