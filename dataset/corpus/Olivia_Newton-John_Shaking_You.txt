Why do I have to care for you?  
When I should have known to stay away  
Why was I there for you?  
I don't know how I lost my touch  
I never believed that I could ever want  
Somebody's love so much  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know I'd be this slow shaking you  
I don't know what I'm looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for  
So don't say that you'll be there for me  
If you don't care for me, I'll be gone  
'Cause I don't have the strength to be this strong  
Tell me all what to do  
Who knew that I'd take so long shaking you  
Now I'm waiting to hit the ground  
I'm painting my love for you in corners I know I will get around  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know I'd be this slow shaking you  
I don't know what I'm looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for
