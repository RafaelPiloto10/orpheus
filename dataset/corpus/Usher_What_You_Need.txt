It's sterile  
Let's get it  
You S, you know what we do  
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it  
  
I pull up at the light and see you looking my way  
I lay back in my seat and think of some pimp shit to say  
It's been a while since one look, made me feel this way  
And I don't intend to let you go, no  
  
And baby I can't wait  
To show you all around the world  
Oh girl, oh girl  
I've got, I've got what you need  
  
Baby, I can give you every thing that you need  
Just trust your man and let me, do me, baby  
I wanna take you places you only see on TV  
Oh girl, I got just what you need  
  
I gotta make a move before the light tries to change  
Let down my window and tell you to just follow me  
I know you wanna come but you seem a little afraid  
Trust me, said, "I promise I won't hurt you baby"  
  
And baby I can't wait to show you all around the world, oh girl  
And baby I can't wait to show you all around the world  
Ooh girl, oh girl  
I've got, I've got what you need  
  
Baby, I can give you every thing that you need  
Just trust your man and let me, do me, baby  
I wanna take you places you only see on TV  
Oh girl, I've got just what you need  
  
Baby, I can give you every thing that you need  
Just trust your man and let me, do me, baby  
I wanna take you places you only see on TV  
Oh girl, I've got just what you need  
  
See right about now  
We gonna take y'all to D.C., Chocolate city  
We gonna set it out southeast style  
Like my main man Chuck Brown used to do  
  
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la  
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la  
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la  
Come on, ooh la la la, ooh la la la  
  
What you need, baby, I can give you every thing that you need  
Just trust your man and let me, do me, baby  
I wanna take you places you only see on TV  
Oh girl, I've got just what you need
