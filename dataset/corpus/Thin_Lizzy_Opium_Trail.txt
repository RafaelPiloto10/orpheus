I took a line that leads you to the opium trail  
Oriental eyes reveal the lies, deceit, betrayal  
On this journey behold one who travels far  
You called him fool but now you are  
  
The wizard wanders through the world made from dreams  
The splashing whirlpool drowns the frightened streams  
Exotic dancers, flashing lancers, this mysterious space  
The fanfare advances, the warlord falls from grace  
  
It clears your pain  
But it's got you claimed again, my love  
You feel the need but it lets you bleed  
You must concede, my love  
  
No one to blame, no shame  
You crave again and again, my love  
No used to plead from you  
It feeds on your greed, my love  
  
I took a line that comes from the golden states of shan  
The smugglers trail that leads to the opium den  
The Chinese connection refines to heroin  
Depart the heart you crave again  
  
It clears your pain  
You soul is claimed again, my love  
You feel the need, it lets you bleed  
You must concede, my love  
  
No one to blame, no shame  
You crave again and again, my love  
No use to plead  
From you it feeds, my love
