Here we are in the west  
And our cars are glistenin'  
The bear he roars in the east  
But we ain't listenin'  
We won't play games in his backyard  
But we let him build his wall  
We say our god is on our side  
Hope he's listenin' to us all  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
We got eyes in the stars  
But we don't care what they see  
We put a man on the moon  
We all see it on t.v.  
We all protest about his bombs  
He hopes we keep it going  
And while we rest he's marchin' on  
His fuse has started glowin'  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
What have you got to hide at home  
His arms are stained but never empty  
The things that you think you own  
Are only for the few  
Don't you think it's time, don't you think it's time  
We got ready, we got ready  
  
We got right on our side  
So our leaders say today  
Count the size of the threat  
We can slide a different way  
Our planes are flyin' in your sky  
We know just what they're sayin'  
You see the writing on the wall  
Your nerves are tearin',frayin'  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed  
He's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
He's gettin' dressed  
He's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill.
