Slow down, you crazy child  
You're so ambitious for a juvenile  
But then if you're so smart, then tell me  
Why are you still so afraid?  
  
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?  
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out  
You've got so much to do  
And only so many hours in a day  
  
But you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even  
Get halfway through  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you  
  
Slow down, you're doing fine  
You can't be everything you want to be  
Before your time  
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight  
Tonight,  
Too bad but it's the life you lead  
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need  
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right  
  
You've got your passion, you've got your pride  
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?  
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
  
Slow down, you crazy child  
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile  
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
And you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you can just get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through  
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
