More than you know, more than you know  
Man of my heart, I love you so  
Lately I find you on my mind  
More than you know  
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong  
Man of my heart I'm gonna string along  
I need you so, more than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]  
Loving you the way that I do  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Loving may be all you can give  
But honey I can't live without it  
  
Oh how I cry, oh how I die  
If you got tired and said goodbye  
More than I chose  
More than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh how I cry, oh how I die  
If you got tired and said goodbye  
More than I chose  
More than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]
