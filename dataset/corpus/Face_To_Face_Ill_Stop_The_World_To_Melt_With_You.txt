Moving forwards using all my breath  
Making love to you was never second best  
I saw the world thrashing all around your face  
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace  
  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time  
There's nothing you and I won't do  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate  
Dropped in the state of Imaginary grace  
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race  
Never comprehending a race that long gone by  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time  
  
There's nothing you and I won't do  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
... The future's open wide...  
Na na naa na na na na  
Na na naa na na na na  
  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
You've seen some changes but it's getting better all the time  
There's nothing you and I won't do  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
.. 1234..  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time  
There's nothing that you and I wont do  
I'll stop the world and melt with you
