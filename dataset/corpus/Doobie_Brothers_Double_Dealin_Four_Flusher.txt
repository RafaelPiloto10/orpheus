There's a change been comin' over you  
Well you burn back baby now what can I do  
And all of that jive that your good friend's been sellin'  
It ain't worth a nickel ya know I been tellin' you  
And you know you could never live without my love babe  
There's no one else who could take my place  
Blue-eyed baby I love you yes I do  
Well my blue-eyed baby I love you yes I do  
  
And nobody here can give the love that you need  
And I'm down on my knees and I'm bleedin' baby  
  
Everybody tells me I'm bein' a fool  
Everybody tells me you're bein' so cruel  
Everybody tells me but I don't believe it babe
