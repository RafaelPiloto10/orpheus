You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard.  
You used to shout out your orders, and your word was the final word.  
Do as I say and not as I do.  
They've taken your picture off the wall.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
You used to chase your women right into your home.  
You used to tell them you loved them over the telephone.  
Now they all see through you  
And you're sinking like a stone.  
No one's knocking at your door,  
No one calls,  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
You're sad and disgusted,  
Is what you've grown up to be.  
Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be.  
But when you live for yourself  
Hell, it's hard on everyone.  
But you did it your way and man you did it all.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
Now you did it your way and man, you did it all.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?
