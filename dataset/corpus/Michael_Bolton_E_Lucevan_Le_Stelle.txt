(Tosca)(How the stars seemed to shimmer)  
  
E lucevan le stelle,  
E olezzava la terra  
Stridea l'uscio dell'orto,  
E un passo sfiorava la rena.  
Entrava ella, fragrante,  
Mi cadea fra le braccia.  
Oh! Dolci baci, o languide carezze,  
Mentr'io fremente le belle forme discogliea dai veli!  
Svani per sempre il sogno mio d'amore...  
L'ora e fuggita e muoio disperato!  
E non ho amato mai tanto la vita!  
  
Synopses

English translation  
How the stars seemed to shimmer,  
The sweet scents of the garden,  
How the creaking gate whispered,  
And a footstep skimmed over the sand,  
How she then entered, so fragrant,  
And then fell into my two arms!  
Ah sweetest of kiss, languorous caresses,  
While I stood trembling, searching her features  
Concealed by her mantle. My dreams of pure love,  
Forgotten forever! All of it's gone now!  
I die hopeless, despairing, and never before  
Have I loved life like this!
