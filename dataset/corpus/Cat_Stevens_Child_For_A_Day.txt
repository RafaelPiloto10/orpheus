I was a child  
Who ran full of laughter  
I was a child who lived for today  
My eyes full of sunshine  
My heart full of smiles  
I was a child for a day  
We were the children  
Who sang in the morning  
We were the children  
Who laughed at the sun  
Who listened to those who spoke with their wisdom  
We are the ones we would say, but  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday  
  
We are the men who worry of nothing  
We are the men who fight without aim  
We listen to no one, yet speak of our wisdom  
We are the pawns in the game  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday  
  
I was a child  
Who ran full of laughter  
I was a child who lived for today  
My eyes full of sunshine  
My heart full of smiles  
I was a child for a day  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday
