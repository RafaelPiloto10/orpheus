I rip open  
Clouds with no faces  
She undoes herself  
For a slice of your pie  
Razorblade sky  
Razorblade sky  
I quench your thirst  
I bleed you dry  
Help you make your bed  
Come undone  
Razorblade sky  
Razorblade sky  
Identifying marks  
Our history picked out in stars  
We rip open the firmamment  
Razorblade sky  
Razorblade sky  
Sky, sky, sky  
Sky, sky, sky  
Sky, sky, sky  
Sky, sky.....
