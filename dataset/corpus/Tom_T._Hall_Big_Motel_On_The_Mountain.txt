This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
And for the people who have loved and some have been loved  
And some were wanted inside your walls  
And for the 22 year old college girl  
Who made that last semester with her smile along your halls  
And for the traveling salesman and the Friday night time dinner out time crowd  
Some were seeking stimulation in the laughter noise and drinks the music loud  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
  
And for the Wednesday Night Auxiliary that meets inside your banquet room at
nine  
For the women's club and the social leads and the regular attendants every
time  
For the lost abandoned child by your northside entrance left alone to die  
For the long haired wide eyed boy selling dope and looking for a place to hide  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
  
For the middle aged executive who thought he'd seen enough  
To slash his wrist in No 10  
And for the 32 year old housewife who got caught with her best friend's
husband  
She ain't around to try again  
For the 7 year old girl swingin' slidin' on the west side near the pool  
Saying why couldn't dad come home with us mama  
Why you got to put me in that school  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time
