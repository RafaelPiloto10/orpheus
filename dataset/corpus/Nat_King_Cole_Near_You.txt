There's just one place for me  
Near you  
It's like heaven to be  
Near you  
  
Times when we're apart  
I can't face my heart  
Say you'll never stray  
More than just two lips away  
  
If my hours could be spent  
Near you  
I'd be more than content  
Near you  
  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that I'll  
Spend the rest of my days  
Near you  
  
If my hours could be spent  
Near you  
I'd be more than content  
Near you  
  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that I'll  
Spend the rest of my days  
Near you  
  
I'll spend the rest of my days  
Near you  
Spend the rest of my days  
Near you (and fade)
