My little girl and I lost Mama just three years ago  
And now that she is older there are things she wants to know  
She said, "Please Daddy tell me 'bout my mother 'cause I miss her."  
I said, "Get pen and paper and I'll help your draw her picture."  
I said, "First draw a heart so big there's room for little else  
Then write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother  
"If you want to make the picture even more complete  
You could draw a little cottage, draw it nice and neat  
Draw a bright and shining sun up in the sky above  
But then again I guess its pretty hard to draw my love  
"So draw a heart so big that there is room for little else  
Write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother."
