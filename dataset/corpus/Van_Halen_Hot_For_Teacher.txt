"Oh wow, man!"  
"Wait a second man. Whaddaya think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"  
"My butt, man!"  
T-T-Teacher stop that screaming, teacher don't you see?  
Don't want to be no uptown fool.  
Maybe I should go to hell, but I'm doin' well,  
Teacher needs to see me after school.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think of all the education that I missed.  
But then my homework was never quite like this.  
Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad,  
I'm hot for teacher.  
I got it bad, so bad,  
I'm hot for teacher.  
  
"Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!"  
"I brought my pencil"  
"Gimme something to write on, man"  
I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold.  
I know about this school.  
Little girl from cherry lane, how can you be so bold?  
How did you know that golden rule?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Oh man, I think the clock is slow"  
"I don't feel tardy"  
"Class dismissed"
