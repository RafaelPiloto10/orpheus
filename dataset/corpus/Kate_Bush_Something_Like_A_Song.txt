There's something that sounds like a song  
In my garden, by the willow  
A piper:  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"  
I see him when I turn the lights down low,  
In my garden, wading through the pond.  
Dressed in sailing wear.  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"  
I've called him by every name I know,  
By every name I know,  
But he won't answer me.  
He keeps coming forward, but never moving.  
Is there no destiny here?  
It sounds like a song  
In my garden, by the willow  
A piper:  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"
