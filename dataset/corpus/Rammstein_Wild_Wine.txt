Wild wine - before your castle  
Wild wine - I am ready  
Arrival is announced - only for the king  
God, stand by me - and open your gates  
Wild wine - and totally slow  
Wild wine - so warm and moist  
Wild wine - before your lap  
Wild wine - it has been written  
Deep in the water - you don't cross  
But my desire - laughs at the wings  
Wild wine - like a dove  
Wild wine - so wet and hot  
Wild wine - before this darkness  
Wild wine - healed by the light  
It stays hidden - otherwise we could defend ourselves  
I wait for you - at the end of the night  
Wild wine - only a grape  
Wild wine - and bitter like snow  
I wait for you - at the end of the night
