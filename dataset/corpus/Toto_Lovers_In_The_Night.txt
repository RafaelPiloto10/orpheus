It's just the soul that matters, and I don't know why  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb  
You know she's gonna make you try, you know she's gonna make you try  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night  
  
It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know she's gonna make you try, ooh, you know she's gonna make you high  
  
It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know she's  
  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
