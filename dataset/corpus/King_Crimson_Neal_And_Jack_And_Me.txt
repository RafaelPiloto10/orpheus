I'm wheels, I am moving wheels  
I am a 1952 studebaker coupe  
I'm wheels, I am moving wheels moving wheels  
I am a 1952 starlite coupe...  
  
En route, les Souterrains  
Des visions do Cody, Sartori a Paris  
Strange spaghetti in this solemn city  
There's a postcard we're all seen before  
  
Past wild-haired teens in dark clothing  
With hands-full of autographed napkins we  
Eat apples in vans with sandwiches, rush  
Into the lobby life of hurry up and wait  
  
Hurry up and wait for all the odd-shaped keys  
Which lead to new soap and envelopes...  
Hotel room homesickness on a fresh blue bed  
And the longest-ever phone call home, no  
  
Sleep no sleep no sleep no sleep and no mad  
Video machine to eat time, a city scene  
I can't explain, the Seine alone at 4am  
The Seine alone at 4a.m, Neal and Jack and me  
  
Absent lovers, absent lovers
