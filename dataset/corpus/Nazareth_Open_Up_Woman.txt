I'm beggin' forgiveness  
But it's gonna take a miracle  
'cause I've been lyin'  
She don't want to know and I think it's impossible  
  
Said open up woman  
I know that you're sad and lonely  
If I could hold you  
We could make it again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
Give me a chance  
  
No more lyin'  
No more secrets  
If I could make you  
I would take you away and cover up your sadness  
I keep sayin' open up woman  
But you don't want to hear my promise  
If I can't have you  
Then I don't need a heart  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Livin' in silence  
Of my own makin'  
Though she won't show me  
I know that her heart and soul are achin'  
  
Open up woman  
I know that you're lost and let down  
I'm gonna keep tryin'  
'Stead of losin' again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Open up woman  
Open up woman
