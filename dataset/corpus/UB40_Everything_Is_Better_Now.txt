Everything is better now  
Better than is was before  
Sunshine on a golden bough  
Darkness locked behind closed door  
Now I found a better place  
Somewhere I can lay my head  
Clean fresh air and open space  
Safe upon my feather bed  
  
I've been a mistake maker  
For all of my days  
And a law breaker  
But crime never pays  
An overtaker  
On lifes highways  
A serial faker  
Making getaways  
  
I've been a mover and a groover  
In the halls of power  
A real bad loser  
In my darkest hour  
A high seas cruiser  
Searching tropical flowers  
A pick and chooser  
In an ivory tower  
  
Now I'm a man of peace  
With a hungry soul  
For I found release  
In a lost loophole  
I'm the masterpiece  
Who just scored the goal  
Let the love increase  
Now I'm in control
