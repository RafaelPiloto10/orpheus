Time stands still for no one  
I know this is true  
I've been stuck here waiting  
Then along came you  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me  
And the sun that you put in my sky  
You don't know how much you've lifted me up  
But I feel so alive  
That I could fly  
I could fly, oh  
  
There's no way I could've made it this far  
Without you  
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe  
That I could make it through  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Above the clouds  
Fly so high, never come down  
Just you and I, I'm so in love  
With you, with you  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me  
And the sun that you put in my sky  
You don't know how much you've lifted me up  
But I feel so alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I could fly, I could fly, oh  
I wanna spread my wings  
Let me tell you  
Said I need your love, I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Oh, I need your love, and I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Oh, I need your love, I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Yeah I need your love, and I need your love  
Stay with me honey baby, c'mon now stay  
C'mon now, yeah  
  
You and me side by side walkin' through the woods in the pale moonlight  
Oh yeah now and it feels so good
