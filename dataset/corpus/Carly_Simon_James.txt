James,  
Your voice is like the water  
When I lift this shell to my ear  
I can hear you pourin' out your heart to me  
James,  
The beauty of your voice  
Lifts us from sadness  
James,  
Let us become like water together  
Sing to me  
Sit on the edge of my bed as when we  
First spent nights together  
Your body wrapped around your guitar  
Let the music speak for your heart  
Let them combine like water and sand  
Let them meet the air like drops of rain  
And bring us together, once again
