No-o-o, I don't want her  
So I'll forget her  
Forget the love she gave me  
Somehow  
I've learned my lesson  
Don't have to tell me  
'Cause I'm gonna start forgettin'  
Yes, I'm gonna start forgettin'  
Right now  
Go on, take my share  
'Cause I don't want her  
And now, she's gone, good riddance, goodbye  
But what my friends don't know  
Is that I love her so  
And in my lonely room all day  
I cry  
Go-o on and take her  
'Cause I don't want her  
I know I'll find another  
Find another  
Somewhere  
No, I don't want her  
She's not my kind now  
And if she's got somebody else  
Oh, really got somebody else  
I don't care  
To think that my love  
Could say "Goodbye, love"  
And leave me here, as low as the ground  
But no one knows but me  
What she means to me  
And when I'm by myself  
All day I sigh  
'Cause without her...  
I could lay me down  
And die
