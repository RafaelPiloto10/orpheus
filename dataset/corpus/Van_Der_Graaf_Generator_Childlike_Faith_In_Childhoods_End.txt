Existence is a stage on which we pass  
a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:  
it's hopeless, I know,  
but onward I must go  
and try to make a start  
at seeing something more than day to day  
survival, chased by final death  
if I believed this the sum  
of the life to which we've come,  
I wouldn't waste my breath  
Somehow, there must be more. There was a time  
when more was felt than known  
but now, entrenched inside my sett,  
in light more mundane,  
thought rattles round my brain:  
we live, we die...and yet?  
  
In the beginning there was order and destiny  
but now that path has reached the border,  
and on our knees  
is no way to face the future, whatever it be.  
Though the forces which hold us in place  
last through eons in unruffled grace  
we, too, wear the face of creation.  
  
As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically  
the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,  
all space is living history.  
It seems as though time must betray us,  
yet we're alive  
and though I see no God to save us,  
yetl we survive  
through the centuries of progress  
which don't get us very far.  
All illusion! All is bogus -  
we don't yet know what we are...  
Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man!  
with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,  
we're grains of sand  
and though, in time, the sea  
may claim us for its own  
we are the rocks which root the future -  
on us it grows!  
  
We might not be there to share it  
if eternity's a jest  
but I think that I can bear it  
if the next life is the best.  
Even if there is a heaven when we die,  
endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie  
that always comes as answer to the question,  
"Why do we see through the eyes of creation?"  
  
Adrift without a course,  
it's very lonely here,  
our only conjecture  
what lies behind the dark.  
Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,  
think of a lifetime which means more  
than my own one -  
dreams of a grander thing than we are.  
Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:  
when all life is over who can say  
no mutated force shall remain?  
Though the towers of the city are denied  
to we men of clay  
still we know we shall scale  
the heights some day.  
Frightened in the silence -  
frightened, but thinking very hard,  
let us make computations of the stars.  
  
Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:  
faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:  
colour blisters, image splinters gravitate  
towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,  
The universe now beckons  
and Man, too, must take His place...  
just a few last fleeting seconds  
to wander in the waste,  
and the children who were ourselves move on,  
reincarnation stills its now perfected song,  
and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.  
  
All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies  
and slavers too,  
all the throng who have danced a merry tune -  
human we can all be,  
but Humanity we must rise above,  
in the name of all faith and hope and love.  
There's a time for all pilgrims,  
and a time for the fakers too,  
there's a time when we all will stand alone  
and nude,  
naked to the galaxies -  
naked, but clothed in the overview...  
as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew.  
  
And though dark is the highway,  
and the peak's distance breaks my heart,  
for I never shall see it, still I play my part,  
believing that what waits for us  
is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past...  
In the death of mere humans life shall start
