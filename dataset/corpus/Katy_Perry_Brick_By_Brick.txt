The weight of my words  
Are like feathers from a bird  
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing  
Cause I've dug myself deep  
I managed to fit both my hands and feet  
All my little white lies  
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach  
  
In one ear  
And out your other  
So lock and key  
You won't open up for me  
  
So brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
  
I guess  
And it feels like you're in China  
And I am in Peru  
When ever I am sleeping next to you  
We can hear the crickets singing  
Oh all throughout the night  
OH boy can we just get used  
To something so right'  
  
And sure I confess  
I'm a mess  
I'm a mess of mistakes  
But please count to ten  
Before you go and throw it all away  
  
So brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
On on on us  
  
Cause if you give up  
Then what am I supposed to do  
All these dreams  
Never will come true  
Without you  
Vocal ad lib  
  
Brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
  
Oh baby don't give up  
On this love  
Don't give up  
On this love
