When I was back there in seminary school,  
There was a person there  
Who put forth the proposition,  
That you can petition the Lord with prayer  
Petition the lord with prayer,  
Petition the lord with prayer  
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!  
Can you give me sanctuary, I must find a place to hide,  
A place for me to hide  
Can you find me soft asylum, I can't make it anymore,  
The Man is at the door  
Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy,  
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy  
There's only four ways to get unraveled,  
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da  
One is a bandit up in the hills,  
One is to love your neighbor 'till  
His wife gets home  
Catacombs,  
Nursery bones,  
Winter women,  
Growing stones  
Carrying babies,  
To the river  
Streets and shoes,  
Avenues,  
Leather riders  
Selling news,  
The monk bought lunch  
Ha ha, he bought a little,  
Yes, he did,  
Woo!  
This is the best part of the trip,  
This is the trip, the best part  
I really like,  
What'd he say?,  
Yeah!,  
Yeah, right!  
Pretty good, huh,  
Huh!,  
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number  
Successful hills are here to stay,  
Everything must be this way  
Gentle streets where people play,  
Welcome to the Soft Parade  
All our lives we sweat and save,  
Building for a shallow grave  
Must be something else we say,  
Somehow to defend this place  
Everything must be this way,  
Everything must be this way, yeah  
The Soft Parade has now begun,  
Listen to the engines hum  
People out to have some fun,  
A cobra on my left  
Leopard on my right, yeah  
The deer woman in a silk dress,  
Girls with beads around their necks  
Kiss the hunter of the green vest,  
Who has wrestled before  
With lions in the night  
Out of sight!,  
The lights are getting brighter  
The radio is moaning,  
Calling to the dogs  
There are still a few animals,  
Left out in the yard  
But it's getting harder,  
To describe sailors,  
To the underfed  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure  
What got us this far,  
To this mild equator?  
We need someone or something new  
Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon  
Callin' on the dogs,  
Callin' on the dogs  
Oh, it's gettin' harder,  
Callin' on the dogs  
Callin' in the dogs,  
Callin' all the dogs,  
Callin' on the gods  
You gotta meet me,  
Too late, baby  
Slay a few animals,  
At the crossroads,  
Too late  
All in the yard,  
But it's gettin' harder,  
By the crossroads  
You gotta meet me,  
Oh, we're goin', we're goin great  
At the edge of town,  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure  
Havin' a good time,  
Got to come along,  
What got us this far  
To this mild equator?,  
Outskirts of the city,  
You and I  
We need someone new,  
Somethin' new,  
Somethin' else to get us through  
Better bring your gun,  
Better bring your gun  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure,  
We're gonna ride and have some fun  
When all else fails,  
We can whip the horse's eyes  
And make them sleep,  
And cry
