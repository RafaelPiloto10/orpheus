You better take what's left  
'Cause I'm feeling rough  
In dread of the night getting high  
And name on the dress  
Stretch far too long  
But it pleases the mind  
And that's nice  
Rain rain rain  
  
She put her head on the line  
When she come strong  
A single girl about town  
And she stands or fall  
By the way she moves  
Ahead of her time  
She can't lose  
Rain rain rain  
  
You got trouble in mind  
Gets deep 'n' worse  
Oh please don't stop getting high  
You got lust for life  
It don't seem to die  
Gonna last for ever  
Getting high  
Rain rain rain
