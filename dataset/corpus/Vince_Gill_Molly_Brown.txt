Molly Brown, waits for me  
In a little one-horse town  
And Boley, Oklahoma  
Where white folks don't come around  
I'm thinkin' about you, Molly  
I'm forbidden to come 'round  
Lord knows I love you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Lay down by my side  
Show me how you spread your wings  
And let that pony ride  
I'm crazy about you, Molly  
I don't care that your skin is brown  
Lord knows I need you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown  
Oh, Molly Brown  
We met down by the river  
She wore her wedding gown  
I never saw it coming  
And no one heard the sound  
My daddy used both barrels  
And left me there to drown  
Lord knows I'd die for Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Don't you weep for me  
I'm going to a place the Lord  
Prepared for you and me  
I'll meet you up in Heaven  
Upon that Holy ground  
I'll be waitin' for you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Lord, I'll be waitin' up in Heavenly  
My sweet little brown, Molly Brown
