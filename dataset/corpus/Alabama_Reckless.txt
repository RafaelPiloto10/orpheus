Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
Love is reckless  
Let's get reckless tonight  
  
There ain't nothin' out here but a big ol' Texas sky  
There's a red sun painted across the coming night  
Well, your daddy's got plans for you  
and mine thinks I'm at school  
They say it's reckless to chase a dream  
But this town's got nothing for you and me  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
Let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight,  
I'll keep the pedal to the floor till we see the morning light.  
They can't live our lives for us,  
If we let them we'll lose our love.  
And love dies hard in this Texas sun,  
I'd rather be reckless and on the run  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
When you're crazy in love you gotta take a chance,  
Burn the bridge and don't look back.  
  
Turn the radio up roll the windows down  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside,  
Baby we're gettin' out of here  
Roll the windows down.  
Turn the radio up
