A boy a girl a love story  
But why did it end in misery  
Taking our chances getting our thrills  
Taking and taking but never getting our fill  
And this is what I see a modern love story  
Love defined on our TV  
Telling us teaching us what we need  
Are we in love or just so alone  
That we're looking for anyone to hold  
And this is what I see a modern love story  
When the prey is caught, the thrill gone  
So we'll switch partners and move along  
And we won't use our brains  
Because our lust is too strong  
Overlooking the person to whom  
The body belongs  
And this is what I see a modern love story
