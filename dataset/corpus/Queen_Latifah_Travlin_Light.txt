I'm trav'lin' light  
Because my man has gone  
But from now on  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
He said, "Goodbye"  
And took my heart away  
So from today  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
No one to see  
I'm free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may come back again  
But until then  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
No one to see  
I'm free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may, he may come back again  
But until then  
I'm trav'lin' light
