Oh please don't go out on me don't go out on me now  
Never acted up before don't go on me now  
I swear I never took it for granted just thought of it now  
Suppose I abused you just passing it on  
Go, fuck  
  
Once fastened servile now your getting sharp  
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm  
I pulled the covers over him shoulda' pulled the alarm  
Turned to my nemesis a fool no fucking god  
No, time, suck, my, please,  
Don't go on me  
Please  
  
Suck, blood, touch, please, tunnel vision, tuck, time, see,  
Please, please, please,  
Don't go on me  
  
Please, Don't you want me, don't go on me,  
Please, don't go on me
