I was on the first ship to Peru,  
Charted all the courses like all sailors do,  
First to cross the Mason-Dixon line,  
Overseein' wetbacks for good California wine.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
I was there when Jan and Liford sang,  
First to feel the cold Alaskan white man,  
First to take a trip on lsd,  
First to vote for Roosevelt back in '33.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
Yes I've seen it, yes I've seen it,  
And deep inside you're brave,  
You know I mean it, yes I mean it.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.
