Hey there lonely girl can I sit with you  
I've just got to find someone to tell my story to  
You've heard it all before now here it is once more  
And please kiss away my tears when I am through  
It's just the same old story once again with a sweet beginning and a bitter
end  
A love affair that didn't turn out right  
And the world has one more broken heart tonight  
Would you like to dance oh you know it's been a long time  
Since I had a woman satisfy my urge  
But you know it never works a false love won't take away hurt  
But just pretend I'm him and I'll pretend you're her  
And it'll be just the same old story  
  
And the world had one more broken heart tonight
