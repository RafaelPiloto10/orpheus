Sitting by a foggy window  
Staring at the pouring rain  
Falling down like lonely teardrops  
Memories of love in vain  
These cloudy days, make you wanna cry  
It breaks your heart when someone leaves and you don't know why  
  
I can see that you've been hurting, maybe I've been lonely too  
I've been out here lost and searching, looking for a girl like you  
Now I believe the sun is gonna shine  
Don't you be afraid to love again, put your hand in mine?  
  
Baby, I would never make you cry  
I would never make you blue  
I would never let you down  
I would never be untrue  
  
I know a place where we can go where true love always stays  
There?s no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days  
  
I believe in second chances  
I believe in angels, too  
I believe in new romances  
Baby, I believe in you  
These cloudy days are coming to an end  
And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again  
  
Baby, I would never make you cry  
I would never make you blue  
I would never turn away  
I would never be untrue  
I know a place where we can go where true love always stays  
There's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days
