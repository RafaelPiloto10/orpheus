No one could ever say that I didn't try to say what once was mine  
Oh girl, you once were my whole life  
But I don't think time will ever let love be the master of our destiny  
Oh, if that's the way it must be  
Then there'll be no dreams for me tonight  
No more grass schemes to try to make you mine  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal  
Maybe some day you'll have a second thought  
About the love that we just lost  
Gotta hope you do but baby tonight, she?ll see and let you go  
Get used to being on my own  
Oh girl, if you really should, really should  
Then there's no dreams for me tonight  
No more grass schemes to try to make you mine  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal  
I could tell you the meaning that your heart stopped being in it  
It?s too late for dreams no matter how magic they may be  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal
