Watch out!  
  
You better get yourself runnin'  
I got hurricane comin'  
No warning surprise  
  
I'm gonna take my leave  
I wanna plant my seed  
Don't let it shock you hold tight, hold tight  
  
You better run for cover  
I'm a hit-n-run lover  
Run for cover tonight (get ready!)  
  
So you think it's easy  
Try to be this sleazy  
Well I'll tell you it's nice (ha ha)  
  
We're gonna make a name  
Ain't gonna play no games  
You'd better take the first flight tonight  
  
You better run for cover  
I'm the hit-n-run lover  
Run for cover tonight  
  
Find some shelter and hide  
No survivors tonight, hold tight, tonight (yeah watch out!)  
  
You better get yourself runnin'  
I got hurricane comin'  
No warning surprise  
  
I'm gonna take my leave  
I wanna plant my seed  
Don't let it shock you hold tight, hold tight  
  
Run for cover  
I'm the hit-n-run lover  
You better run for cover tonight (yeah)  
  
Run for cover  
I'm the hit-n-run lover  
Run for cover tonight  
Look out  
Watch out  
Get out
