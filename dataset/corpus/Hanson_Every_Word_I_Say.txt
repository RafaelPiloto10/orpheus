You feel like liberation  
You give me new sensation  
You show me what I need and  
You are my life completed  
  
Can't stop, can't break, who's driving?  
Sometimes there's no denying  
Till today I feel I can't lose  
I'm letting go of what I knew  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
Before you I was only  
What I let control me  
You are a revolution  
Against my own conclusions  
Till today I feel I can't lose  
I'm letting go of what I knew  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
And now I say goodbye to the way I used to be  
There is no room for question  
Cause your name it sets me free  
Yesterday's troubles harm me  
Today's are creeping in  
So let go of the world around me  
Cause your love is all I need  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and that's okay  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
Every word I say  
Every word I say  
In every word I say  
  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name well all I hear is your name  
All I hear is your name  
All I hear is your name  
And no one can take it away
