There's no-one coming with that freedom train.  
There's nowhere you can go where you feel no pain.  
Take the blinkers off you eye's,  
The power is in your hand.  
Stop waiting for your ticket to the promised land.  
There ain't no heaven and there ain't no hell.  
Except the one we're in, and you know to well  
There's no-one waiting on,  
Waiting on a higher high.  
Don't let the only world you're ever gonna live in pass you by.

Go check on the news  
Go listen to political views
