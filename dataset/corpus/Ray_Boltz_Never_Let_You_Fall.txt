Never Let You Fall  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
As you step into the unknown  
I know you're frightened  
You feel alone  
There's something you should understand  
You are my child  
You're in my hand  
Chorus:  
And I will never let you fall  
This is a promise to believe  
I will never let you fall  
Any further than your knees  
Now I hear you praying for a child  
You're so afraid they'll go wild  
Don't forget my love is true  
And I will carry them  
Like I've carried you  
And I will never let them fall  
This is a promise to believe  
I will never let them fall  
Any further than their knees  
Chorus
