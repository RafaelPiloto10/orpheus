Your cruel device  
Your blood, like ice  
One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
  
Your mouth, so hot  
Your web, I'm caught  
Your skin, so wet  
Black lace, on sweat  
  
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)  
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name  
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)  
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
Poison...

One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
Poison (Poi-son)  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
Yeah  
Well I don't want to break these chains  
Poison (Poi-son)  
Runnin' deep inside my veins  
Burnin' deep inside my brain  
Poison (Poi-son)  
And I don't want to break these chains  
Poison
