Perhaps it was something that hit me, perhaps it was something I ate,  
But out of the blue I dreamed I met you and you said to me, "Hi, ya Gate!"  
Millions have heard you play Chopin, the critics applaud and approve,  
But millions more would simply adore to hear you get in the groove.  
  
You won't believe it, you'll think it's a dream  
To hear them riffing it, right on the beam,  
But when you hear trumpets give out a call, you'll know  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
Instead of Strauss they play Irving Berlin,  
Instead of Brahms it's "Begin the Begin"  
Those classic ackies are due for a fall since  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
They're playing  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, with Shostakovich,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, Mozart and Bach,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, and they don't know which,  
'Cause anything can happen when they start to rock.  
  
The philharmonic was so dignified  
But now they're groovy and starting to ride,  
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall  
'cause The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down in Carnegie Hall.  
  
They-hey swing ev'rything with a ding dong  
And when the Maestro gives them a beat, it's a  
Reet Beat that starts 'em to toot with a  
Root Toot that's a bit of alright,  
And even Jose Iturbi getting hep, he's hep, he's hep.  
Boy!  
  
Tschai-Tschai-Tschai-kovsky would really be hurt  
To hear 'em jivin' his Piano Concert,  
Beethoven's lucky, he can't hear at all  
Because the Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall.
