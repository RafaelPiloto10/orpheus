Hear my voice  
Where you are  
Take a train  
Steal a car  
Hop a freight  
Grab a star  
Come back to me  
  
Catch a plane  
Catch a breeze  
On your hands  
On your knees  
Swim or fly  
Darling please  
Come back to me  
  
On your mark  
Now get set  
Hop a mule  
Hop a jet  
In a towel wringing wet  
I don't care  
This is where you should be  
  
From the hills to the shore  
Ride the wind to my door  
Turn the highways to dust  
Break the law if you must  
Move the world  
Only just come back to me  
  
Must I yell 'til I'm blue?  
Where are you and will you  
Come back to me?  
Have you gone to the moon  
Or the corner saloon?  
In Rome or Rangoon  
I'm a wreck  
Where in heck can you be?  
  
In a crate  
In a trunk  
Half asleep  
Roaring drunk  
In a rolls or a van  
Anyway that you can  
I'd be so nice to come home to  
Lover come back  
Come back to me
