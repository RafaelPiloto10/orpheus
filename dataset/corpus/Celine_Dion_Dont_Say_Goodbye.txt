If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try
