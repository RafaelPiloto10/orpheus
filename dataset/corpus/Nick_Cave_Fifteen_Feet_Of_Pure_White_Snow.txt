Where is Mona? She's long gone  
Where is Mary? She's taken her along  
But they haven't put their mittens on  
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?  
Where is Michael? Where is Mark?  
Where is Mathew, now it's getting dark?  
Where is John? They are all out back  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Would you please put down that telephone?  
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
I waved to my neighbor, my neighbor waved to me  
But my neighbor is my enemy  
I kept waving my arms till I could not see  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is anybody out there please?  
It's too quiet in here and I'm beginning to freeze  
I've got icicles hanging from my knees  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anybody here who feels this low?  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder?  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Doctor, doctor, I'm going mad  
This is the worst day I've ever had  
I can't remember ever feeling this bad  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Where's my nurse? I need some healing  
I've been paralyzed by a lack of feeling  
I can't even find anything worth stealing  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anyone else here who doesn't know?  
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder?  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself
