He's five foot two and he's six feet four  
He fights with missiles and with spears  
He's all of thirty-one  
And he's only seventeen  
  
He's been a soldier for a thousand years  
He's a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist, a Jain  
A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew  
He knows he shouldn't kill  
  
But he knows he always will  
Kill you, my friend, for me and me for you  
He's fighting for Canada, he's fighting for France  
He's fighting for the USA  
He's fighting for the Russians  
  
And he's fighting for Japan  
And he thinks he'll put an end to war that way  
He's fighting for democracy, he's fighting for the Reds  
He says it's for the peace of all  
He's the one who must decide  
  
Who's to live and who's to die  
But he never sees the writing on the wall  
But without him how would Hitler have condemned them at Dachau  
Without him Caesar would have stood alone  
He's the one who gives his body  
  
As the weapon of the war  
And without him all this killing can't go on  
He's the universal soldier and he really is to blame  
His orders come from far away no more  
  
They come from him, and you, and me  
And brother, can't you see  
This is not the way to put an end to war
