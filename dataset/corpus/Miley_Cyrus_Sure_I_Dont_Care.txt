I don't care what you say to me. Just forget that that we were meant to be
(oooooh)  
You were never meant for me your jokes were biting me to the bone. And the
things we shared I couldn't bare...  
Chorus  
Sure I don't care you always get your way. I wanna hang up now (up now.) I
thought you were good guy at first but you always turning me down.  
Baby Baby just ignore me. We have no chemistry... (no no.)  
You hurt girls as fast as people blink no one wants to take that... (ah ah.)  
Chorus  
I'm sorry I have to say this but... Goodbye... Hahaha
