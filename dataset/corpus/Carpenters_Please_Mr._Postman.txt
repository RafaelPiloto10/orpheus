(Stop)  
Oh yes, wait a minute Mister Postman  
(Wait)  
Wait Mister Postman  
  
Please Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
(Oh yeah)  
For me to hear from that boy of mine  
  
There must be some word today  
From my boyfriend so far away  
Pleas Mister Postman, look and see  
If there's a letter, a letter for me  
  
I've been standin' here waitin' Mister Postman  
So patiently  
For just a card, or just a letter  
Sayin' he's returnin' home to me  
  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
(Oh yeah)  
For me to hear from that boy of mine  
  
So many days you passed me by  
See the tears standin' in my eyes  
You didn't stop to make me feel better  
By leavin' me a card or a letter  
  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
  
(Why don't you check it and see one more time for me, you gotta)  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
  
(C'mon deliver the letter, the sooner the better)  
Mister Postman
