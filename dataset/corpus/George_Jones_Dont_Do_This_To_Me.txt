I've tried hard in pleasin', you tell me you''re leavin'  
I must know the reason, don't do this to me  
My loves like a flower that grows every hour  
It's my only power, don't do this to me.  
  
Don't squeeze it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it  
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see  
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it  
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me.  
  
Don't treat me so wrongly for I love you only  
Don't leave me so lonely, don't do this to me  
Cause I love you honey, much more than all money  
Don't think that it's funny, don't do this to me.  
  
Don't squeeze it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it  
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see  
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it  
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me.  
  
Don't breathe it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it  
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see  
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it  
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me
