The power of reason, the top of the heap  
We're the ones who can kill the things we  
Don't eat  
Sharper than a serpent's tongue  
Tighter than a bongo drum  
Quicker than a one-night stand  
Slicker than a mambo band  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah!  
We're building the perfect beast  
(building, building, etc..)  
It's olympus this time- olympus or bust  
For we have met the enemy -and he is us  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah!  
We're building the perfect beast  
(building, building)  
Ever since we crawled out of the ocean  
And stood upright on the land  
There are some things that we just don't  
Understand:  
Relieve all pain and suffering  
And lift us out of the dark  
Turn us all into methuselah-  
But where are we gonna park?  
(building, building)  
The secrets of eternity-  
We've found the lock and turned the key  
We're shakin' up those building blocks  
Going deeper into that box- (pandora  
Wouldn't like it)  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released  
Glory hallelujah!  
We're building the perfect beast  
(building, building)  
All the way to malibu from the land of the  
Talking drum-  
Just look how far-look how far we've come
