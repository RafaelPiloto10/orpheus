[Eponine is alone in the square.]  
  
Eponine  
Cosette! Now I remember!  
Cosette! How can it be?  
We were children together  
Look what's become of me...  
  
[Marius returns.]  
  
Good God! Oh, what a rumpus!  
  
Marius  
That girl, who can she be?  
  
Eponine  
That cop! He'd like to jump us  
But he ain't smart, not he.  
  
Marius  
Eponine, who was that girl?  
  
Eponine  
Some bourgeois two-a-penny thing!  
  
Marius  
Eponine, find her for me!  
  
Eponine  
What will you give me?  
  
Marius  
Anything!  
  
Eponine  
Got you all excited now,  
But God knows what you see in her  
Ain't you all delighted now  
  
[She refuses Marius' money.]  
  
No, I don't want your money sir...  
  
Marius  
Eponine, do this for me...  
Discover where she lives  
Be careful how you go  
Don't let her father know...  
  
'Ponine! I'm lost until she's found!  
  
Eponine  
You see, I told you so!  
There's lots of things I know...  
  
[Marius leaves.]  
  
'Ponine... She knows her way around...
