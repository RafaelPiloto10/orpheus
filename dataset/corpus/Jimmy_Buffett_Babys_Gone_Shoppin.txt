Baby's gone shoppin' she's lookin' around  
She's checkin' out the boys and the clothes about town  
Pick up this drop off that  
Stares at her pictures from the Fotomat  
Oh she likes what she sees  
But she's afraid of what she needs  
  
She should be here with me  
She should be here with me  
  
But I don't make it easy, I'm no day at the beach  
Just an old road dog gettin' harder to teach  
Hang on this planet, hang on each twirl  
Scatter my belongings all over this world  
I get more wrapped up each day,  
She's lookin' further away  
She should be here with me  
She should be here with me  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Not much good at conversation  
I don't want a proclamation  
I just think that we could use  
A little face to face communication  
  
Now I've been thinkin' thinkin' this through  
Time to stop all this selfishness,  
Both me and you  
I'll stop from here, you stop from thee  
We'll meet somewhere in the middle  
Darlin' I don't care  
I don't want no more heartaches,  
It's time to slam on the brakes  
She should be here with me  
  
Baby's gone shoppin'  
No more bar hoppin'  
I don't know but I been told  
Thay city livin' gets awfully cold
