I'm your maker  
Mold your mind  
Idea-creator  
Bias from behind  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
What we can't tie  
What we can't buy  
Must die  
  
I'm soul hunter  
Of the might  
Upright hatemonger  
Angel of the blind  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who know must follow  
They who don't die bound  
  
I pay billions  
All got a price  
Plain corruption  
No roll of the dice  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
What we can't tie  
What we can't buy  
Must die
