So we live out in our old van  
Travel all across this land  
Me and you  
  
We'll end up hand in hand  
Somewhere down on the sand  
Me and you  
  
Just as free  
Free as we'll ever be  
Just as free  
Free as we'll ever be  
  
Drive until the city lights  
Dissolve into a country sky  
Me and you  
  
Lay underneath the Harvest moon  
Do all the things that lovers do  
Just me and you  
  
Just as free  
Free as we'll ever be  
Just as free  
Free as we'll ever be  
Ever be  
  
No we don't have a lot of money  
No we don't have a lot of money  
No we don't have a lot of money  
No we don't have a lot of money  
No we don't have a lot of money  
No we don't have a lot of money  
All we need is love  
  
We're free as we'll ever be  
Just as free  
Free as we'll ever be  
Ever be  
  
So we live out in our old van  
Travel all across this land  
Me and you
