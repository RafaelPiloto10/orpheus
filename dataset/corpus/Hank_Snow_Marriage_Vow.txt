Do you take this woman to be your dear wife  
Do you vow to love her the rest of your life  
And will you protect her and honor her name  
Oh don't cause her heartaches and don't bring her shame  
Share with her in poverty with her in wealth  
For richer for poorer through sickness and health  
All these things the Parson did ask me and then I whispered I do and I'd do it
again  
  
For I really love her the one I call wife and I'll go on caring the rest of my
life  
I'd die to protect her and she'd do the same  
I'd cut off my tongue before I'd bring her shame  
We may be in poverty may not have wealth  
But we stick together through sickness and health  
I'll always be thankful till my life is done that two little words made us
both into one
