I saw daddy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Last night  
He didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
[Mike screams "Oh GOD!"]  
He thought I was up in the bedroom fast asleep  
  
Then, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the Christmas tree last night  
There must be some mistake  
Was I really awake?  
I move in closer, but better look away  
  
[Mike and Billie make barfing noises]
