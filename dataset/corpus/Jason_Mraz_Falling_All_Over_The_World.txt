Said I'm fallin all over the world  
Said I'm fallin  
This love affair,  
It isn't all there but it's everywhere  
Said I'm fallin all over, fallin over and over  
But the blue shy, oh blue soul  
And love with the tole it's taken  
A true crime is the perfect role  
I love every more that I take in  
So much that I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
Said I'm fallin all over the world  
It's a breath of air, so rare  
Thick as thunder  
Said I'm fallin all over,  
Every wonder so, full of wonder, so beautiful  
There's magic up above  
Every cliche I learn to love  
But as long as these birds have wings  
Then I'll have songs, and I'll have words to sing  
Sing of fallin over, I'm fallin over the whole damn thing  
Said I'm fallin all over the world  
Said I'm fallin
