Last night she ran away  
Left a letter by the telephone  
She didn't take the time to say goodbye  
He knows he has to find her  
Find a way to make her come back home  
She stretched her wings and learned to fly  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He calls but there's no answer  
Operator, ring it one more time  
He thinks of her and shuts his eyes  
She wears the ring he gave her  
Something magic, and it once was mine  
Will she be thinking of him tonight?  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He has to find her  
I really miss that girl  
He steals into the night  
He'll go mad without her  
I'm so mad about her  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me
