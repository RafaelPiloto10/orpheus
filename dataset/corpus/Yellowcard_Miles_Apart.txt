If I could I would do all of this again  
Travel back in time with you to where this all began  
We could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behind  
Make believe there's something left to find  
  
[Chorus]  
We'll be miles apart  
I'll keep you deep inside you're always in my heart  
A new life to start  
I may be leaving but you're always in my heart  
  
Now we've all grown up, gone on and moved away  
Nothing I can do about it, nothing I can say  
To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard  
Looking back it all just seemed so far, so far away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd give it up for just one more day with you  
Give it up for just one more day  
I'd give it up for just one more day with you  
I'd give it up for just one more day with you  
  
I'd give it up for just one more day with you  
Give it up, give it all away  
I'd give it up for just one more day with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need you now, we're miles apart  
I'll keep you deep inside you're always in my heart  
I need you now, we're miles apart  
I may be leaving, but you're always in my heart
