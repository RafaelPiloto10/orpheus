Showers of sadness flood my soul  
In the dryness of my pain  
I watch for the rainbow  
When my heart turns gray  
As I long for yesterday  
I know that I need you  
In the time that I stray  
So I'll follow like night after day  
  
(Chorus)  
I need you to rain down on me please pour down your light  
For this is my life-line  
I need you to rain down on me  
The weather is fine when you rain on me  
The weather is fine when you rain on me  
  
The power of gladness takes control  
When it's streaming from Your face  
You vanish my sorrow  
You wash it away  
Like the sunlight in the rain  
I know that I need You  
In the time that I stray  
So I'll follow like night after day  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Holy water falls as I lift my eyes  
From my own fate  
Then heaven flows straight through my  
heart as it carries your embrace  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
The weather is fine when you rain on me
