I feel a surge coming over me  
I feel it all around my thighs  
And chills going up my legs  
This is the worst coming out of me  
When I can't tell, felt like I could die yeah  
And it sends chills up my spine  
  
Your're sexy sexy  
I got things I want to do to you  
Make me make me  
Make my tongue just go do-do-do  
Flex it, flex it  
Flex your muscles, and through the roof  
Arrest it rest it  
'Cause you're a criminal  
  
I been laying in this bed all night long  
Don't you think it's time to get it on  
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong  
Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone yeah yeah  
  
I feel the thirst pouring out of me  
For things that I wanna try  
That echoes in my head  
This is the first time I get to see  
Things I've never seen in my life yeah  
You make flowers grow under my bed yay  
  
Your're sexy sexy  
I got things I want to do to you  
Make me make me  
Make my tongue just go do-do-do  
Flex it, flex it  
Flex your muscles, and through the roof  
Arrest it rest it  
'Cause you're a criminal

Don't you think it's time to get it on yeah  
But we gotta get it right (get it right) we can't get it wrong (can't get it

Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone yeah yeah  
  
Do you feel me?  
Oh  
I thought so  
I just oh  
Sometimes you just wanna  
  
Uh be naughty  
  
I feel so alone when you were gone  
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms  
You played my strings like my guitar  
When I look in your eyes I see all the stars  
  
Would you believe  
I'm dancing in the mirror (dancing in the mirror)  
I feel like I got no panties on  
I wish that I could feel ya (wish I could feel ya)  
So hurry, hang up that damn phone  
  
I been laying in this bed (this bed) all night long (all night long)  
Don't you think it's time to get it on  
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong  
Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone yeah yeah  
  
On and on, and make it last forever  
What you want all day  
Just as long as it's you and I together  
Babe don't make me wait yeah
