Everyone thinks I'm crazy  
For thinking that when you see me  
You're gonna love me  
  
But I tell them it's easy  
Like loving is supposed to be  
  
Walk into the room love  
I'll be waiting  
Miles and miles and miles oh my love  
I've come to find  
Find you  
  
Must request a dance or two  
Until morning ruins  
All my plans for you  
  
Strangely I don't give a damn  
About his circumstance  
Or hang-up for you  
  
Walk beside this lullaby love  
For dreams of you and I love  
Miles and miles and miles oh my love  
I've come to find  
Find you  
  
How  
Many ways  
Can I explain  
My love  
For you  
  
Without  
Sounding like a little girl  
Looking up to you  
  
Taught  
Me everything  
Yes you taught  
  
... Taught me pain  
And because of you I've changed  
  
Everyone thinks I'm crazy  
For thinking that when you see me  
You're gonna love me
