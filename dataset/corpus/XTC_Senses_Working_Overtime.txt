Hey hey,the clouds are whey,  
There's straw for the donkeys  
And the innocents can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely.  
  
My my, sun is pie  
There's fodder for the cannons  
And the guilty ones can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely.  
  
And all the world is football shaped,  
It's just for me to kick in space  
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste  
And I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and  
The church bells softly chime...  
  
Hey hey, night fights day,  
There's food for the thinkers  
And the innocents can all live slowly  
All live slowly  
My, my the sky will cry  
Jewels for the thirsty and the guilty ones can  
All die slowly all die slowly.  
And all the world is biscuit shaped,  
It's just for me to feed my face  
And I can see,hear, smell, touch, taste  
And I've got one, two,three, four, five sense working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...  
  
And birds might fall from black skies  
And bullies might give you black eyes  
And buses might skid on black ice  
But to me it's very very beautiful (England's glory!)  
Beautiful (a striking beauty!)  
And all the world is football - shaped,  
It's just for me to kick in space  
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste -  
And I've got one,two,three,four,five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one,two,three, four,five senses working overtime  
Try to tell the difference 'tween the goods and crimes,  
Dirt or treasure and there's  
One, two, three, four,five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...
