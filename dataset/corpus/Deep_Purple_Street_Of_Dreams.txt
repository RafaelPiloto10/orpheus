I heard the sound of voices in the night  
Spellbound, there was someone calling  
I looked around, no one was in sight  
Pulled down and I kept on falling  
  
I've seen this place before and you were standing by my side  
I've seen your face before tonight  
Maybe I just see what I want it to be  
I know it's a mystery  
  
Do you remember me on a street of dreams?  
Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
  
There you stood, a distant memory  
So good, like we never parted  
Said to myself, I knew you'd set me free  
And here we are right back where we started  
  
Something's come over me and I don't know what to feel  
Maybe this fantasy is real  
Now I'm gonna see what I want it to be  
But it's still a mystery  
  
Do you remember me on the street of dreams?  
Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
You're on every face I see on the street of dreams  
  
Something's come over me and I don't know what to feel  
Maybe this fantasy is real  
Now I'm gonna see what I want it to be  
But it's still a mystery  
  
Do you remember me on the street of dreams?  
Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
On the streets of dreams  
  
I know you will always be on the street of dreams  
Will we ever meet again, my friend, on the street of dreams?  
Do you know just what it means to be on the street of dreams?  
Never know just who you'll see, do ya? On the street of dreams  
You can be who you wanna be, oh Lord, on the street of dreams  
I can hear you calling me on the street of dreams
