I want a Sunday kind of love  
A love to last past Saturday night  
And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight  
And I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea yea  
  
I want a a love that's on the square  
Can't seem to find somebody  
Someone to care  
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to no where  
I need a Sunday kind of love  
  
I do my Sunday dreaming, Oh yea  
And all my Sunday scheming  
Every minute, every hour, every day  
  
Oh I'm hoping to discover  
A certain kind of lover  
Who will show me the way  
  
And my arms need someone  
Someone to enfold  
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold  
Love for all my life to have and to hold  
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea yea yea  
  
I don't want a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, or Thursday, Friday or Saturday  
Oh nothing but Sunday oh yea  
I want a Sunday Sunday  
I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea  
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday kind of love
