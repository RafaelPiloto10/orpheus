How can I go on when every thought hurts  
I flirt with the notion of no more songs  
My old familiar foe, self pity, haunts me  
I'm stuck in some over-the-mountain town  
In a meaningless bar where fat hands  
Round the steiners  
And no one cares if it suns or pours  
In an hour between trains  
Barney puts the record on  
And the aimless rise to dance  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
I see you, George, in your  
Apartment on Riverside Drive  
Some fifty years ago  
Your fingers on the keys  
Looking for the song  
Looking for that hook  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
Who were you then?  
Did you have a woman?  
Were you hard up for cash?  
Did you ever know you'd be heard in  
The middle distance  
In some over-the-mountain town?  
Connecting to the muscles of the dancers  
In this close and smoky room  
  
Who were you then?  
Were you sure of your tune?  
Or were your dreams and your courage all broken down like mine?  
Now there's something that clutches the heart  
A melody that stays  
  
Year after year  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all I want my arms around you  
I'm already late for my train  
But I don't think about that  
I think of you, George  
At your piano, sweating in the summer heat  
  
By the way, did you get your girl,  
Did you by your house in the country?  
Did you wait for something that never came?  
Did you die still waiting for your train?  
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama  
Come to mama do  
  
Some part of your heart twists and turns in mine  
Your soul rises  
There's an angel in charge  
There's one note that weeps the truth  
And makes my life mean something  
Just for the length of  
  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama,  
Come to mama do  
  
I will go home, I will try again  
I will catch the train  
Catch another breath  
Move back to the piano and  
Let the notes do what they'll do  
In honor of you, George  
In honor of you
