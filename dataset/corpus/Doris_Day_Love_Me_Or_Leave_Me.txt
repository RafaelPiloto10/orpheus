This affair is killin' me  
I can't stand uncertainly  
Tell me now I've got to know  
Whether you want me to stay or to go  
  
Love me or leave me  
Or let me be lonely  
You won't believe me, I love you only  
I'd rather be lonely  
Then happy with someone else  
  
You might find the night time  
The right time for kissin'  
But night time is my time  
For just reminiscin'  
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'  
With somebody else  
  
There'll be no one  
Unless that someone is you  
I intend to be independently blue  
I want your love  
But I don't want to borrow  
To have it today to give it back tomorrow  
For your love is my love  
There's no love for nobody else
