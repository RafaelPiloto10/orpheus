Kaie a ahou-ou  
Kay kalli nei  
A-ahee ah-ah ee aha  
Cou-ou alhoa  
  
This is the moment  
Of sweet aloha  
I will love you longer  
Than forever  
Promise me that you  
Will leave me never  
  
Here and now, dear  
All my love I vow, dear  
Promise me that you  
Will leave me never  
I will love you longer  
Than forever  
  
Now that we are one  
(My darling)  
Clouds won't hide the sun  
(My darling)  
Blue skies of Hawaii  
Smile on this  
Our wedding day  
  
I do (I do)  
Love you (love you)  
With all my heart  
  
I do (I do)  
Love you (love you)  
With all, my, heart
