Everybody's got the blues  
In the morning day, yeah  
If you find the answer  
And you wonder  
Let's find a way  
I want to give you happiness  
Just like the sun gives to the day  
I'd like to make you mine yeah  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Just like a blinding dream  
Yeah, you're gonna be with me  
  
Strolling through a summer's breeze,  
And you find it's not the rain,  
Leaving wrong behind you,  
All your fantasies so very plain.  
  
I want to give you happiness  
Just like the sun gives to the day  
I'd like to make you mine, yeah  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Just like a blinding dream  
Yeah, you're gonna be with me.
