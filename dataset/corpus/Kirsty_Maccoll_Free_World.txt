(kirsty maccoll)  
I thought of you when they closed down the school  
And the hospital too  
Did they think that you were better?  
They were wrong  
You had so many friends  
They all left you in the end  
'cause they couldn't stand the patter  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by a struggle  
Going down  
You've got to walk into the water  
With your sister and your daughter  
In this free world  
If I wore your shades could I share your point of view?  
Could I make you feel better?  
Paint a picture, write a letter?  
Well I know what you're saying  
But I see the things you do  
And it's much too dangerous  
To get closer to you  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world  
(I wouldn't tell you if I didn't care)  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
And the ghettoes are full of mercedes benz  
And you'd never hurt a friend  
Who wouldn't tell you  
It's cold and it's going to get colder  
You may not get much older  
You're much too scared of living  
And to die is a reliable exit  
So you push it and you test it  
With 'thunderbird' and 'rivin'  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united in the struggle  
In this free world baby  
Got to take it got to grab it  
Got to get it up and shag it  
In this free world  
Going down  
You've got to get into the water  
Like a lamb goes to the slaughter  
In this free world baby  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world  
(I wouldn't tell you if I didn't care)
