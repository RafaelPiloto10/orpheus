She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
I met a gin soaked, bar room queen in Memphis  
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride  
She tried to heave me right across her shoulder  
And I just can't seem to drink her off my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
I laid a divorcee, right here, in New York City  
I had to put up some kind of a fight  
The lady then, ooh, she covered me in roses  
Well, she blew my nose and then she blew my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues, all right  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
Yeah, yeah
