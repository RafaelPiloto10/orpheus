No tears, no tears no more  
I'm done cryin' now  
No pain no pain, said I found another way  
No games, not like before  
Not up here on this cloud  
No time for yesterday,  
Let me explain  
  
I got a new woman,  
Lovin' me in every way that she can,  
All she wanna be is part of my plan,  
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way hey  
  
Got a new woman  
Loves to walk around just holdin' my hand  
Cupid must have found us lovin' like that  
Lovin' this woman  
  
Does anybody understand  
That I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
Said I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalalalalai  
I'm In Love  
  
No stress, no fuss, no fight  
When I'm in her arms  
No time no day no night (no nothin' better no)  
So much more than okay,  
Life is made of this  
No her, no me, no way  
Let me explain  
  
Got a new woman, lovin' me in every way  
That she can, all she wanna be is  
Part of my plan, safe to say that I'm in a better way  
A better way  
  
Got a new woman  
Loves to walk around just holdin' my hand  
Cupid must have found us lovin' like that  
Lovin' this woman  
  
Does anybody understand  
That I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
Said I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalala  
I'm in love  
  
I want the whole damn world to know  
Sure as the wind blows  
Carry the message, far as it can go  
Man I'm in love  
Sometime my way is close  
There's nothin' that can hold back this feeling  
True lovin' in which we're dealin' baby  
I-I-I-I'm in love, I-I-I-I'm in love  
  
Does anybody understand I'm in love  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
I'm in love  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalala  
I'm in love  
  
Lalalalala I'm in love
