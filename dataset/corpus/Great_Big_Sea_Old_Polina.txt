There's a noble fleet of whalers  
They're sailing from Dundee  
Manned by British sailors  
That take them o'er the sea  
On a western ocean passage  
We started on the trip  
We flew along just like a song  
On a gallant whaling ship  
Was the second Sunday morning  
Just after leaving port  
We met a heavy sou'west gale  
And washed away our boat  
It washed away our quarterdeck  
Our stanchions just as well  
And so we set the whole shebang  
A-floatin' in the gale  
  
[Chorus]  
For the wind was on our quarter  
The engines working free  
There's not another whaler  
That sails the arctic sea  
Can't beat the Old Polina  
You need not try my sons  
We challenged all both great and small  
From Dundee to St John's  
  
Art Jackman set his canvas  
Fair Weather galloped steam  
And Captain Guy, the daring boy  
Came plunging through the stream  
And Mullins in the Husky  
Tried to beat the bloody lot  
But to beat the Old Polina boys  
Was something he could not  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's the noble terra Nova  
A model without doubt  
The Arctic and Aurora  
They talk so much about  
Art Jackman's model mail boat  
The terror of the sea  
Tried to beat the Old Polina  
On a passage from Dundee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're back in old St John's  
Where rum is very cheap  
We'll drink a health of Captain Guy  
Who brought us o'er the deep  
A health to all our sweethearts  
And to our wives so fair  
Not another ship could make the trip  
The Polina I declare  
  
[Chorus: x2]
