The ship was heaving with a mass of humankind  
My heart was grieving for the the land that lay behind  
The cruel ocean echoed all those sad goodbyes  
That at my leaving almost made me change my mind  
The night was darker than my scared and lonely eyes  
  
And then that old Manhattan moon began to rise  
And there stood Liberty in silhouetted skies  
And from that moment on I knew that I'd embrace  
Each opportunity to be a part of this place  
Five points and then Hell's Kitchen  
All stops in between  
Somewhere to find an itchin' for this keen Colleen  
Didn't stop me yearning now and then for my old world  
Dreamed I might return just once again to that old world  
But in my heart a piano roll played ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love that old Manhattan moon  
  
I swore allegiance at each rising of the moon  
And learned by heart each swinging Yankee Doodle tune  
And from the moment it first caught me in its beam  
I knew that moon would guide my old American dream  
Five points to Fifth Avenue Central  
All stops in between  
No time to get too sentimental for any shade of green  
That don't stop me yearning now and then for that funny old world  
Could be I'll return just once again to that funny old world  
But in my heart a piano roll plays ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love my old Manhattan moon
