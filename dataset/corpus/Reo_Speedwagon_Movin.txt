I was sittin' with the sun, meltin' into the horizon  
High in the hills, up above Topanga canyon  
And I've never been to any other place that made me feel more like movin'  
Made me feel like movin'.  
  
Stopped into a shop where I met a young lady  
She thought I ought to move, she said livin' here could save me  
Oh and I've never been with any other girl who made me feel more like movin'  
She made me feel just like movin'.  
  
But I used to wonder why people got so excited  
About movin' to California  
I've only been here a week but I've been enlightened  
To a whole new way of life  
And it makes me feel just like movin'.
