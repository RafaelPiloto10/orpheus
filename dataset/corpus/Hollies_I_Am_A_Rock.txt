A winter's day in a deep and dark december  
I am alone  
Gazing from my window to the street below  
On a freshly fallen , silent shroud of snow  
  
I am a rock I am an island  
  
Don't talk of love  
Well, I've heard the word before  
It's sleeping in my memory  
Don't disturb the slumber  
Of feelings that have died  
If I never loved, I never would have cried  
  
Chorus  
  
I build walls  
A fortress deep and might  
That none may penetrate  
I have no need of friendship  
Friendship causes pain  
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain  
  
Chorus  
  
I have my books  
And my poetry to protect me  
I am shielded in my armor  
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb  
I touch no one and no one touches me  
  
Chorus  
  
And a rock feels no pain  
And an island never cries  
  
Chorus x 2
