You bring me happiness then leave me loneliness  
My world is in distress yet I keep falling for you  
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies  
You're a heartbreak in disguise yet I keep falling for you  
  
Oh darling when you're near my world is happy dear  
But when you disappear I don't know what to do  
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's such a mystery why I keep falling
for you  
  
Oh darling when you're near...  
It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you
