The devil's in the dreaming  
He tells you I'm not sleeping in my hotel room alone  
With nothing to believe in  
You dive into the traffic rising up  
And it's so quiet  
You're surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things you're losing  
You might as well resign yourself to try and make a change  
I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
The devil's in the dreaming  
You see yourself descending from a building to the ground  
You watch the sky receding  
You spin to see the traffic rising up  
And it's so quiet  
You're surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things I'm losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
But I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
In one of these dreams, you forgive me  
It makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home  
How could anyone else have changed?  
All these wrong conclusions that leave you alone  
How could everyone rearrange?  
How could everyone else have changed?  
What I see I believe  
  
For all the things I'm losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
Well, I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling around my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
But I can't sleep at night
