You'll never know  
What you've done for me  
What your faith in me  
Has done for my soul (echo)  
And you'll never know the gift you've given me  
I'll carry it with me  
yeah ee yeah  
  
Through the days ahead I'll think of days before (mm hmm)  
You made me hope for something better (yes you did)  
And made me reach for something more  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
  
You opened my eyes  
You opened the door  
To something I'd never known before  
And your love (love)  
Is the music of my heart (music of my heart)  
  
You were the one  
Always on my side (always on my side)  
Always standing by (always standing by)  
Seeing me through  
You were the song that always made me sing  
I'm singing this for you (singing this for you baby)  
Everywhere I go I'll think of where I've been (think of where I've been)  
And you're the one who knew me better than anyone ever will again (?)  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside (siiidee)  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
You opened my eyes  
You opened the door (you opened the door)  
To something I'd never known before (ohh ohhhhh)  
And your love (your love)  
Is the music of my heart (music of my heart)  
  
What you taught me  
Only your love could ever teach me  
You got through when no one else could reach me (baby ohhh ohhh ohhh)  
'cause you always saw in me  
All the best that I could be  
It was you who set me free
