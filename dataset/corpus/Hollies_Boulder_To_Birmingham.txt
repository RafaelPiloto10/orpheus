I don't want to hear your love song  
I got on this aeroplane just to fly  
And I know there's life below me  
But all that you can show me  
Is the prairie and the sky  
  
And I don't want to hear a sad story  
Full of heartbreak and desire  
The last time I felt like this  
I was in the wilderness  
And the canyon was on fire  
  
And I stood on the mountain  
In the night and I watched it burn  
I watched it burn, I watched it burn  
  
[Chorus:]  
I would rock my soul  
In the bosom of Abraham  
I would hold my life  
In his saving grace  
I would walk all the way  
From Boulder to Birmingham  
If I thought I could see  
I could see your face  
  
Well, you really got me this time  
And the hardest part is knowin'  
I'll survive  
I've come to listen for the sound  
Of the trucks as they go down  
Out on ninety-five  
And pretend that it's the ocean  
Comin' down to wash me clean  
To wash me clean  
Baby do ya know what I mean  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
