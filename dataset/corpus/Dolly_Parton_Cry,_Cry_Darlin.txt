Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do  
If you should leave me with the blues  
Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do  
If you're the one that I should lose  
  
For me there will be no moonlight  
If ever we should part  
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart  
  
Cry, cry darlin', my eyes would cry  
And never dry if you should go  
Cry, cry darlin', when shadows creep  
I'll just weep all night I know  
  
You know how much I'd miss you  
If ever we should part  
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart  
  
Oh, cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart
