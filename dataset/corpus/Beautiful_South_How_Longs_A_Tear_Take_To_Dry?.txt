How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman has no breeze?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman, when a woman's on her knees?  
  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman hasn't sinned?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When the weather, when the weather brings no wind?  
  
Look I'm sorry that I hurt you  
You look a million dollars and a dime  
Time's the greatest healer  
But love's the greatest stealer of all time  
  
I'm so sorry,  
My heart's broken, (mine's the same)  
I still love you (make it plural)  
You're so sweet!  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When almighty brings is rain?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
And do tears, and do tears really stain?  
  
This heart was like a tardis  
I went and lost the key in a fight  
I've never found a locksmith  
Will you be my locksmith tonight?  
(Will I shite)  
  
I'm so sorry, (make it plural)  
My heart's broken, (mine's the same)  
I still love you (make it plural)  
You're so sweet!  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
  
How long does sorry really last  
Is it tattooed upon your heart?  
Or is it hung in a museum  
With your Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa ex-ass art?  
  
I have no summer, (I'll buy you summer)  
I'll buy July, if December makes you cry  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by
