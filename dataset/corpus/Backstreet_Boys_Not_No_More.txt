Not No More  
  
  
Oooh oooh  
She stayed with 'em all  
But she got her own place  
She made me wait too long  
But you let me hit the second date yeah  
  
She's always asking me for my  
But girl you got your own  
I'm always trying to teach her things  
But her tricks fooled on  
  
She didn't stick around  
But now you hold me down  
I've been there and I tell you now girl  
She's my every don't  
But you are my everyone  
  
That's why she used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
She'd work my last nerve,  
You made it all good  
She wouldn't do the things I like  
But always knew you would  
Mmmmmmmm  
  
I couldn't let you go, I wanna keep it on the low  
Cause I never had nothing like this before  
And I let you know you are so incredible  
That's why I'm telling you  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
No more wondering just where we stand  
No more feeling like I'm the other man  
Girl I need to know if you are down to stay  
No more should've, would've, could've been  
Cause I'm through with yesterday  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
Used to fight for her  
But not no more  
Used to cry for her  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more
