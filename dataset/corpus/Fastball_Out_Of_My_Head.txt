Sometimes I feel like I'm drunk behind the wheel  
the wheel of possibility  
However it may roll, give it a spin  
See if you can somehow factor in  
You know there's always more than one way  
to say exactly what you mean to say  
  
Was I out of my head or was I out of my mind?  
How could I have ever been so blind?  
I was waiting for an indication, it was hard to find  
Don't matter what I say, only what I do  
I never mean to do bad things to you  
So quiet but I finally woke up  
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
