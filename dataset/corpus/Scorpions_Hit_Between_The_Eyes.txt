Late at night when you're all alone  
Take a ride to the danger zone  
If someone wants to cut you down to size  
You never argue with a loaded .45  
  
Just when you've had enough  
It's really getting tough  
  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Can't you see I'm much too young to die  
  
You can feel the tension in the street  
There's no escape, getting closer to the heat  
You play with fire, get your fingers burned  
It's too late, past the point of no return  
  
Just when you've had enough  
It's really getting tough  
  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Can't you see I'm much too young to die
