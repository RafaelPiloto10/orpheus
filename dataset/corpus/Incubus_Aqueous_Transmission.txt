I'm floating down a river  
Oars freed from their homes long ago  
Lying face up on the floor  
Of my vessel  
I marvel at the stars  
And feel my heart overflow  
  
Further down the river  
  
Two weeks without my lover  
I'm in this boat alone  
Floating down a river named emotion  
Will I make it back to shore?  
Or drift into the unknown  
  
Further down the river  
  
I'm building an antenna  
Transmissions will be sent  
When I am through  
Maybe we can meet again  
Further down the river  
And share what we both discovered  
Then revel in the view  
  
Further down the river  
  
I'm floating down a river
