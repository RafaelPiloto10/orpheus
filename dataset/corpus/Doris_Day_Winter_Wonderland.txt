Over the ground lies a mantle of white  
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night  
Two hearts are thrillin' in spite of the chill in  
The weather  
  
Love knows no seasons, love knows no climb  
Romance can blossom, any old time  
Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin'  
Together  
  
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful site, we're happy tonight  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings his love song, as we go along  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man"  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland
