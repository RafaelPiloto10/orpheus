I was alone not long ago  
Without a love to call my own.  
I was afraid and thought  
It wasn't meant for me.  
I didn't need anybody else  
That was what I would tell myself.  
And I believed that was how it would be.  
  
I used to think that I was fine.  
Oh, that I was doing ok.  
I didn't know that I was blind.  
I just went on along my way.  
I didn't know what I was missing  
'Til I felt you tender lips  
Kissing my fears away.  
I'm so glad you're here today.  
  
I never had somebody I could lean on.  
I never had a shoulder I could cry on  
'Til I found you babe -  
'Til I found you.  
And I never had somebody I would think about.  
I Never had someone I coudln't do without  
'Til I found you babe -  
'Til I found you.  
  
I had been badly hurt before.  
Eversince then, I would ignore  
Any chance for love -  
I thought it was a lie.  
I learned to rely on myself  
And I thought that I was doin' well  
Until you came with something  
I just can't deny.  
  
I used to think that I was fine oh,  
I was doing alright.  
I would go on and do my thing  
Everyday and every night.  
I didn't know what I was missin'  
'Til i felt your tender love  
Fillin' me up inside.  
I love you with all my might.  
  
(And i never knew how good a love could feel  
'Til I found you babe, wooh.  
And I never thought a love could be so real  
'Til I found you.)
