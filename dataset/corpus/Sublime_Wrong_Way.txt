Annie's twelve years old in two more she'll be a whore  
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way  
Don't be afraid with the quickness you get laid  
For your family'll get paid  
It's the wrong way  
  
I gave her all that I had to give  
I'm gonna make it hard to live  
Salty tears running down to her chin  
And the ruins up her makeup I never wanna live  
  
A cigarette pressed between her lips  
But I'm staring at her tits  
It's the wrong way  
Strong if I can but I am only a man  
So I take her to the can  
It's the wrong way  
  
The only family that she's ever had  
Is the seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad  
He needed money so he put her on the street  
Everything was going fine till the day she met me  
  
Happy are you sad, want to shoot your dad  
I'll do anything I can it's the wrong way  
We talked all night and tried to make it right  
Believe me shit was tight  
It was the wrong way  
  
So run away if you don't want to stay  
'Cause I ain't here to make you, oh no  
It's up to you what you really want to do  
Spend some time in America  
Dubstyle  
  
She'll give you all that she got to give  
But I'm gonna make it hard to live  
Big salty tears running down to her chin  
And it smears of her makeup I never wanna live  
So we ran away  
And I'm sorry when I say that straight to this very day  
It was the wrong way  
She took a hike it don't matter if I like it or not  
Because she only wants the wrong way  
  
I gave her all that I had to give  
She still wouldn't take it, whoa no  
Her two brown eyes are leaking like salty tears  
It still ruins her makeup and never want to give
