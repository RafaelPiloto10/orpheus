Wish everybody would leave me alone -yeah  
They're always calling on my telephone  
When I pick it up there's no one there  
So I walk outside just to take the air  
Come on with me cruising down the street  
Who knows what you'll see, who you might meet  
This brave new world's not like yesterday  
It can take you higher than the milky way  
  
Now I'm blinded I can't really see, yeah  
No more bright lights confusing me, no  
Don't ask me why I'm feeling blue  
'Cause loving you is all I can do  
Hey good-looking boys, gather around  
The sidewalk papers gutter-press you down  
All those lies can be so unkind,  
They can make you feel like you're losing your mind  
  
Street Life  
Street Life  
Street Life  
What a Life  
  
Back to nature boys, Vasser girls too  
Watch what you say, or think, or do  
Continental-style strasse girls might  
But you know exactly if it's wrong or right  
Education is an important key, yes  
But the good life's never won by degrees, no  
  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale  
Only window shopping, it's strictly no sale  
Week end starts Friday soon after eight  
Your jet black magic helps you celebrate  
You may be stranded if you stick around  
And that's really something
