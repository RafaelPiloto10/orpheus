Ooh, noo  
Ooh, ooh  
Talking wreckless  
All night  
You gotta make  
That happen baby  
You got me excited baby  
Ooh, ooh  
How come the one  
You got ain't never  
The one you need  
Listen to me  
You say you  
You talking 'bout  
You gon' walk out on us  
This crazy good  
But I don't believe you  
I don't really care  
About all that  
So I keep coming back  
I can't help myself  
  
You make it harder for me  
Don't wanna get up and leave  
When you don't put  
That thing on girl  
You know just what I need  
And I know  
That I should leave her alone  
I'm in a fatal attraction  
(Fatal attraction)  
  
If it was all up to me  
We do it over and (over)  
Over again  
But girl  
What about your man  
I know  
That I should leave her alone  
I'm in a fatal attraction  
(Fatal attraction)  
  
Ooh baby I swear  
I wonder to myself  
Just how we got here  
It's gon' take  
Everything for me  
To leave you alone  
'Cause the vision  
That I get  
Wanna make your body  
Be calling me  
Baby you know you  
Like to give it to me girl  
You know how we do  
I used to try and act  
Like I ain't need you before  
But that was before  
You make me want you more  
Girl if he only knew  
  
You make it harder for me  
Don't wanna get up  
And leave  
When you don't put  
That thing on girl  
You know  
Just what I need  
And I know  
That I should leave her alone  
I'm in a fatal attraction  
(Fatal attraction)  
  
If it was all up to me  
We do it over and (over)  
Over again  
But girl what about your man  
I know  
That I should leave her alone  
I'm in a fatal attraction

When you don't put  
That thing on girl  
You know  
Just what I need and I  
Know

Over again  
But girl what about your man  
I know  
That I should leave her alone  
I'm in a fatal attraction
