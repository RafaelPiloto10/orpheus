Chorus:  
A heartsong melody play like a symphony  
The sweetest music I have ever known  
A song of joy and pain  
The mountain angels sing  
A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong  
Farmer's daughter if you will  
And I often wonder still  
In memories where I rammbled as a child  
Makes me cry and makes me laugh  
My reflections on the past  
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life  
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs  
Just enough to go around  
But the sweetest things in life are always free  
Like the songs the birds would sing  
And the sweet new grass of spring  
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree  
Repeat Chorus  
And I recall the thrill and joy  
Of a Smokey Mountain boy  
I remember my first kiss and my first love  
And the songs I'd song and write  
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight  
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove  
And in that little house 'a prayer  
Where I spent many hour  
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name  
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me  
As I headed up that rocky road to fame  
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world  
But it makes no difference just how far I roam  
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart  
My faith in God and memories of home  
Repeat Chorus
