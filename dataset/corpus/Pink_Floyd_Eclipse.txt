All that you touch  
All that you see  
All that you taste  
All you feel  
All that you love  
All that you hate  
All you distrust  
All you save  
All that you give  
All that you deal  
All that you buy  
Beg, borrow or steal  
All you create  
All you destroy  
All that you do  
All that you say  
All that you eat  
And everyone you meet  
All that you slight  
And everyone you fight  
All that is now  
All that is gone  
All that's to come  
And everything under the sun is in tune  
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
