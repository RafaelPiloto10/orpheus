All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You don't look at their faces  
And you don't ask their names  
You don't think of them as human  
You don't think of them at all  
You keep your mind on the money  
Keeping your eyes on the wall  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
I want to make a million dollars  
I want to live out by the sea  
Have a husband and some children  
Yeah, I guess I want a family  
All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You don't look at their faces  
And you don't ask their names  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
Deutch marks or dollars  
American Express will do nicely, thank you  
Let me loosen up your collar  
Tell me, do you want to see me do the shimmy again?  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do
