I seen this girl, walking down the block  
I said, "wait!"  
"Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?"  
"Have some donuts and milk?"  
"Listen to a pop tune maybe?"  
  
Please be his ex and be my bride  
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried  
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there  
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair  
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole  
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role  
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby  
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me  
I cry out your name as you hold his hand  
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned  
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain  
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain  
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad  
Fantasize of the love we could have had  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I pour wine for two, even though it's just me  
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see  
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring  
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing  
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two  
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you  
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap  
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
The time has come, the decision's yours  
This super love story ain't working no more  
Can't you understand that my love spans  
Higher and further than any man's  
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth  
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout  
You're my only desire, I fight to the death  
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath  
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close  
To our love I toast, all he does is boast  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
A knock on the door and a tap on the glass  
Tells me you see it my way at last  
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me  
He called you up and said, "Yo baby, why you diss me?"  
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore  
You want more of what you used to ignore  
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy  
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me  
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'  
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight  
But my agony continues till it reaches night  
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall  
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall  
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon  
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon  
So I dress to impress, exit the house  
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out  
In the middle of the court yard there you stand  
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction  
You won't get used if you follow my instructions  
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm  
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan  
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down  
You will find your best friend finally is found  
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white  
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight  
And tender and young, soft and wet  
It's hotter than any fantasy could get  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more
