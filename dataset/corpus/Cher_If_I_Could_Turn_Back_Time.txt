If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay  
I don't know why I did the things I did  
I don't know why I said the things I said  
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside  
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes  
  
I didn't really mean to hurt you  
I didn't want to see you go  
I know I made you cry, but baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way,  
I'd take back those words that'd hurt you  
And you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give 'em all to you  
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do  
If I could turn back time  
  
My world was shattered I was torn apart  
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart  
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care  
But I lost everything darling then and there  
  
Too strong to tell you I was sorry  
Too proud to tell you I was wrong  
I know that I was blind,  
And darling  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way,  
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you  
And you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do, oh  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time, whoa baby  
  
I didn't really mean to hurt you  
I didn't want to see you go  
I know I made you cry, but baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way,  
I'd take back those words that hurt you  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give 'em all to you  
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way,  
Then maybe, maybe, maybe  
You'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give 'em all to you
