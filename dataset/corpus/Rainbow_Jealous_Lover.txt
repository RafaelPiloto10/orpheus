Lost and lonely  
Clouds hide the sun  
Out on the highway  
It's all hit and run  
  
Cold empty nights  
Demons in my head  
It's something I did  
Or baby something you said  
  
And it's hard to discover  
That you're just another  
Jealous Lover  
And its so tough to take  
  
But you're making no mistake  
Jealous Lover  
Oh Yeah  
Don't want no other  
  
Shades of red  
Eyes of green  
Sees black and white  
And there's no in between  
  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
Still you keep thinking  
That it's all alibis  
  
And it's hard to discover  
You're like any other  
Jealous Lover  
And you're saying I'm a fake  
  
But you're making a mistake  
Oh, no no  
Every day it's the same  
The faces and the names  
  
How long can I go on  
Playing this game  
So I live for the nights  
Soft candle lights  
  
Today they love you  
Then tomorrow they might  
And it's hard to face  
Someone else takes your place  
  
Jealous Lover  
And they're saying that's the brakes  
But I got what it takes  
Jealous Lover, oh oh  
  
Jealous Lover  
Jealous Lover  
Don't need no, no no  
Don't need no other  
  
Jealous Lover, yeah  
Jealous Lover
