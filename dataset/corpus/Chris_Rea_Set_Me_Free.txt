Wake up see the morning light  
This is you  
This is today  
You try so hard to get it right  
Can't help thinking somewhere you lost your way  
When was the last time  
You saw a smile ?  
There's a scream on every silent face you see  
They're singing set me free  
  
I got a friend  
Who burns like a fire  
Says there's only one thing you'll ever know  
It's out there somewhere  
Way out on the open road  
  
And me I'm always looking down  
Down that road out of town  
Each morning and night  
You can see me  
I'm singing set me free  
Set me free  
  
Goodnight Auberge  
I leave you now  
You must sleep  
While I work the day  
Till I return  
To dream of you  
Through the night  
And that free, freeway
