Don't' do anything I wouldn't do  
Pass me anyway, like I'm a fool for you  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
It's not unusual  
It's only tearing you apart  
Don't' do anything I wouldn't do  
Pass me anyway, lie like a fool  
Laugh at me anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
It's not unusual  
It's only tearing you apart  
Oh, how can I be  
So far away  
Without a reason?  
Should I know  
How not to lose?  
How can I not  
Follow you anywhere?  
But I'm lost  
Take me away!  
Takin' all my time, make me a choice  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
You can't believe it to be  
The thing that's tearing you apart  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing visual  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
The thing you're dreamin' of is  
The thing that's tearing you apart  
Even though I'm wasting my time
