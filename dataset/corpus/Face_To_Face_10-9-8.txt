I'll be your loaded dice  
You're holding all the cards  
You set the tone whenever I'm with you  
You make up all the rules  
In this game of fools  
I see your signals change  
They go from green to red  
It's always stop and go  
When the colors are changing  
Never let on, never let on  
Look to the left, look to the right  
Why can't you look me straight in the eye  
(Chorus)  
10-9-8  
I'm always counting down  
You feel the pressure when you're under the gun  
6-5-4  
I'm always counting down  
Isn't it funny, I never get to one  
I'll be your only chance  
I play the only role  
I go the distance whenever I'm with you  
You make up all the rules  
In this game of fools  
You keep me in the dark  
I'm walking on the wire  
I'm on the edge  
It's always my time for falling  
Never let on, never let on  
Look to the left, look to the right  
Why can't you look me straight in the eye  
(Chorus)
