The darkness came closer to home on the  
Following night  
And Miriam slept like a rock when  
Jonathan's face went white  
  
The bedroom was ice cold  
But the fire was burning still  
The blinding light  
The family ghost had risen again...the ghost  
  
Don't be scared, don't be scared now my friend  
I am count de lafey  
Let me take you to the crypt down below  
Where Abigail rests  
  
Let Miriam sleep  
She never would understand  
Now come let us go... it's time to know  
  
Beware of the slippery stairs  
You could easily fall and break your neck  
Hand me that torch and I will lead the way  
To the secret in the dark  
  
Take a look into the vault, the vault  
The sarcophagus...of a child  
Abigail has been in here for years and years  
Stillborn, born... born... born  
  
The spirit of Abigail is inside your wife  
And there's only one way you can stop  
The rebirth of evil itself  
You must take her life now
