I got a body built for sin and an appetite for passion  
Yeah I can see the road to ruin and I'm lookin' for some action  
I got my finger on the trigger and a match to the fuse  
I'll make someone an offer that's too big to refuse  
Tired of tryin' to be what I'll never be, baby,  
You could never see that  
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance, I just want to forget you  
Time to take my chances, find somebody new  
I just want to for, I just want to for, I just want to forget you  
I'm gonna set the night on fire, shootin' like a Roman Candle  
Ooh yeah, I'm burnin' with desire and I'm much too hot to handle  
I'm like a runaway, crazy train, I'm out of control  
If you try to put the brakes on, I'm still gonna roll  
Tired of tryin' to do what you want me to, baby,  
I'm just tired of you, yeah  
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance, I just want to forget you  
Time to take my chances, find somebody new  
I just want to for, I just want to for, I just want to for  
I just want to forget you  
Wake up, baby, don't you sleep, I can't take this one more week  
If I can't go out to play, I can't make it one more day  
I want to play with dynamite, time is right for heavy breathing  
Gettin' stone cold crazy till the dawn without a reason  
I want to take me a vacation down a long stretch of track  
I'll find a new sensation and I ain't comin' back  
Tired of tryin' to be what I'll never be, baby,  
You could never see that  
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance  
I don't want a romance, or a second chance  
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance  
I just want to for, I just want to forget  
I just want to forget you, yeah!
