The street is cold, the dawn is grey  
My heart says no but my head says stay  
My work is finished, or so I've been told  
Can't part the three of us, once we got a hold  
  
I forgot the name  
I took a shot on the chin  
I'm rearranging my game  
Tell by the shape I'm in  
  
In line of fire, you know what to say  
They gave us no choices, just one shade of grey  
My legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray  
But I know each step we take, they're one step away  
  
I found the secret, the key to the vault  
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls  
I took the time, to feel for the door  
I found the secret, the key to it all  
  
I got the Nouveauree  
And dragged it home to bed  
I traded you for me  
I took it all and said  
  
I find my own fun,  
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin' for me  
Walkin' on Gucci,  
Wearin' Yves St. Laurent barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt
