Winter sounds the crying  
Like an old man slowly dying  
And the only sound, the wind that fills the trees  
Even colder comes the moon  
And though it never seems too soon  
A sudden stillness as the rainfall starts to freeze  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm Mr. Blue  
I'm here to stay with you  
And no matter what you do  
When you're lonely  
I'll be lonely too  
  
A young girl, she is shaded  
Bears the scars that never faded  
Of the baby that was born on Christmas Day  
While the heavens sing their song  
A child's life is never long  
'Cos the food supplies will only last a day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Patriot emotion, is the cause of the commotion  
After all there's really no-one here to blame  
Soldiers taking orders, 'cos we must defend the borders  
Of our nation (and the other side's the same)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll come to you at night  
When all the world is sleeping tight  
And lie beside you, 'til the early morning dew  
You can't hear me, you can't see  
But you can feel me when you read  
The folded letter she left addressed to you  
  
[Chorus]
