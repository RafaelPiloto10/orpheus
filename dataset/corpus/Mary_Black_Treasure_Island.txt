Oh love is never easy  
It's almost always out of your way  
It's not the path of least resistance  
It's not some words you get to say  
  
It's a stream running up a mountain  
It's a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
I have a friend who's lonely  
She is chasing after her dreams  
And she is the one and only  
One who knows how hard it could be  
  
There's a treasure on her island buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose  
  
One friend tried to end it  
He could not see the good in his life  
In his mirror or his pocket  
And his hopes had come down like a knife  
  
It's a stream running up a mountain  
It's a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
There's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose  
Oh there's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose
