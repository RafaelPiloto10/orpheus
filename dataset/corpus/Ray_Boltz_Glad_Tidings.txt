Glad Tidings  
Words by Ray Boltz, Steve Millikan, and Randy Melson, Music by Steve Millikan
and Ray Boltz  
In the beginning was the Word  
And the Word was with God  
In the beginning was the Word  
And the Word was God  
In Him was Life the Light of men  
That shineth in the darkness  
The darkness did not comprehend  
This Light that dwelt among us  
And so it was  
The lowly shepherds lay  
And suddenly  
They heard an angel say  
As they were frightened by a great light  
chorus:  
Glad tidings to all the world  
Glad tidings we bring  
Unto you is born this day Emmanuel  
A Savior and a King  
The angel said  
No need to be afraid  
I bring you tidings of great joy  
For unto you is born this very day  
A Savior, Jesus Christ the Lord  
And then the heavens  
Were filled with praise  
chorus (repeat 2X)
