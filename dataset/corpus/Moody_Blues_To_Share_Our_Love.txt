Makes me feel good,  
Now I can see  
It takes more than one to give  
The life we need.  
  
I can't think why  
I never thought of this before  
Now I know what it means to share  
To share my love.  
  
Now I know why  
I've found the answer for myself  
What a day it would be to share  
To share your love  
  
Can't think  
Why I never thought  
Of this before, now I know  
What it means to me  
To share, share all my love with you,  
To share, share all my love with you.  
  
Can't think  
Why I never thought  
Of this before, now I know  
What it means to me  
To share, share all my love with you,  
To share, share all my love with you.
