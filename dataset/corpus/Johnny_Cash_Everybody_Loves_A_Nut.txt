Everybody loves a nut  
The whole world loves a weirdo  
Brains are in a rut  
But everybody loves a nut  
  
There was a hermit named Fred  
Who kept the dead horse in his cave  
And everyone said to Fred  
"Fred, how come you keep a dead horse  
In your cave?", and he said, "Well"

(The whole world loves a weirdo)  
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut  
A Columbia man named Frank  
Had a tiger named Hank  
  
He tried to put Hank in his tank  
Guess what happened to ol' Frank  
When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs  
And erected a tombstone that read  
  
(Everybody loves a nut)  
Another Columbia fella told queen Isabella  
I don't think the world is flat  
And now what do you think about that  
  
And she said  
"You don't", and he said, "No mam"  
And she said  
"He'd get out of my queendom"  
And he said, "Yes mam"

Everybody loves a nut
