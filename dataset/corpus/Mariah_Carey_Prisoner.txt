Here comes the night  
No more living in the shadow of your love  
This is my life  
You always tried so hard to keep me down  
But now I'll rise above  
Those empty lies  
Stop pretending that my accusations  
Take you by surprise  
I've realized  
Now I'm ending all the secrecy  
I see through your disguise  
All the dreams we planned  
I believed so I held on  
I understand  
So when the morning comes  
You know that I'll be gone  
  
You don't think that I'll be strong enough  
I won't be a prisoner of your love  
  
No longer blind  
I can focus on deception  
Used to keep me by your side  
I read your mind  
Don't believe it's all a mystery  
There's nothing you can hide  
It's all defined  
There's nothing you can tell me now  
To change the way I feel inside  
All the dreams we planned  
I believed so I held on  
I understand  
So when the morning comes  
You know that I'll be gone  
  
You don't think that I'll be strong enough  
I won't be prisoner of your love  
I'm just not the girl you thought I was  
I won't be a prisoner of your love
