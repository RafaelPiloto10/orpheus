(olivia newton-john)  
  
See them play in the moonlight  
Watch them dance in the sun  
They're the children of freedom--everyone  
As they care for each other  
With no question or cause  
They deserve to be treasured as a source of love  
  
In their minds there are answers  
And in time we will know  
What the truth is about all we don't know  
They have no room for hatred  
Though they've suffered much pain  
From the race we call human--who are afraid of love  
  
If I can only help to right a wrong  
With my dolphin song  
Then i'll have done what I set out to do  
If I can only make one man aware  
One person care  
Then i'll have done what I promised you  
  
Let us hope it's not too late  
And that we can amend  
All the pain we have suffered on a friend  
We were born with our freedom  
Oh we were born with the truth  
Then why do we abuse it  
We could choose--to love, to love
