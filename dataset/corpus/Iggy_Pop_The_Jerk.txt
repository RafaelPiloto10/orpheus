Look, here comes the jerk !  
See the guy with the fakey smile,  
Talkin' to my girl in a friendly style.  
  
He thinks he's quite the flirt,  
She'd suck a rats' dick before she'd fuck  
Him his brain is full of dirt,  
That's why the guy's a jerk,  
His balls are gonna burst,  
that's why the guy's a jerk  
Oh man you're killin' me!  
Hey man your killin' me!  
  
He hangs out by the ladies room,  
His pick up line is like the voice of doom.  
"Hey baby do ya want to go out with me,  
and by the way I make a lotta money."  
His method just don't work,  
That's why the guy's a jerk.  
By the office Johnny lurks,  
That's why the guy's a jerk  
  
Jerk [Repeat: x11]  
  
Oh man you're killin' me!  
Hey man your killin me!  
look here comes the jerk [Repeat: x4]  
Him his brain is full of dirt,  
That's why the guy's a jerk,  
His balls are gonna burst,  
That's why the guy's a jerk  
Oh man you're killin' me!  
Hey man your killin me!
