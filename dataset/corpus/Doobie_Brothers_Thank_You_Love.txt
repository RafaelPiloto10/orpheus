Why am I soaring high  
Just one look and you touched my mind  
I have heard of this thing  
Now my heart can truly sing  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny  
You have shown me the way  
Now I know love is here to stay  
As the path opens wide  
We clearly see love cannot hide  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny  
This is heaven, my dear  
I've never seen love quite so clear  
We will wander no more  
Our hearts are one, let's close the door  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny
