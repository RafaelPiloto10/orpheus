(Boy of mine, boy of mine, dear little boy of mine)  
Boy of mine, boy of mine, although my heart was aching,  
I seem to know that you'd want to go,  
Pride in your manhood waking,  
  
I'll be here, waiting, dear,  
Till at the glad dawn breaking,  
I'll hear you say you're home to stay,  
Dear little boy of mine (mine), dear little boy of mine. (boy of mine)  
  
(Boy of mine, boy of mine, although my heart was breaking,)  
I'll hear you say you're home to stay,  
Dear little boy of mine(mine), dear little boy of mine  
(dear little boy of mine).
