If you're feeling sad and lonely  
There's a service I can render  
Tell the one who loves you only  
I can be so warm and tender  
  
Call me, don't be afraid  
You can call me  
Maybe it's late but just call me  
Tell me and I'll be around  
  
When it seems your friends desert you  
There's somebody thinking of you  
I'm the one who'll never hurt you  
Maybe that's because I love you  
  
Call me, don't be afraid  
You can call me  
Maybe it's late but just call me  
Tell me and I'll be around  
  
Now don't forget me, 'cause if you let me  
I will always stay by you  
You gotta to trust me, that's how it must be  
There's so much that I can do  
  
If you call, I'll be right with you  
You and I should be together  
Take this love I long to give you  
I'll be at your side forever  
  
Call me, don't be afraid  
You can call me  
Maybe it's late but just call me  
Tell me and I'll be around  
  
Call me, don't be afraid  
You can call me  
Maybe it's late but just call me  
Tell me and I'll be around  
  
Call me, don't be afraid  
You can call me  
Maybe it's late but just call me  
Tell me and I'll be around  
  
I'll be around, I'll be around  
Call me, I'll be around, I'll be around  
Oh, call me, call me and I'll be around  
I'll be around, just call me  
I'll be around, you can call me, baby and I'll be around
