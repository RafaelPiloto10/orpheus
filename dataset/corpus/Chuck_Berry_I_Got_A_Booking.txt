I got a booking with the airlines  
Pack up and going to go  
I'm gonna leave here by plane, darling  
Because railway is much too slow  
I'm goin' back to my hometown  
Where I'm better known  
'Cause you haven't done nothing, darling  
But ruin a happy home  
Now, when the sun sinks in the hillside  
The one you love will be gone  
And I know I will be blue darling  
But somehow I'll just travel on  
Now, would you rather care to kiss me  
Or would you prefer to just say goodbye  
'Cause I will turn and leave you darling  
I don't want to see you cry
