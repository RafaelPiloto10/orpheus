I lost ten points just for being in the right place  
at exactly the wrong time  
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have  
been completely blind  
So, if you see me walking all alone  
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home  
there's a train leaves here this morning, and  
I don't know, what I might be on  
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would  
all be so life long  
I looked around then for a reason  
when there wasn't something more to blame it on  
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone  
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on  
There's a train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on  
ooo, ooo, ooo.. etc...  
1320 North Columbus was the address  
that I wrote down on my sleeve  
I don't know just what she wanted  
might have been that it was getting time to leave  
and I watched as the smoker passed it on  
and I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on."  
cause there's a train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on  
And there's train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on
