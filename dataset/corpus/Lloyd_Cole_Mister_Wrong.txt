I know that I've been wrong  
And I have no one to hang it on  
So I take you by the hand  
And I ask you please to understand  
I just want to see you smile  
But all I ever do is make you cry  
Hah hah, hah hah  
  
Guess I'm tough to be around  
Babe you're tough to be away from  
You know every place I've been  
Every place I wish I'd never seen  
Now I just want to see you smile  
But all I ever do is make you cry  
Hah hah, hah hah  
  
You know what you're doing  
It's a very special thing to ruin now  
You know what you're doing  
But you don't know why  
Oh oh  
  
Now I know what you've been thinking all along  
You're saying oh oh no mister wrong  
Oh oh oh mister wrong  
Oh oh oh
