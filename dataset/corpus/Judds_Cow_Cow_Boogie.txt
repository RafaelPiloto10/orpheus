Out on the plains down near Santa fe  
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day  
And as he jogged along I heard him singing  
A most peculiar cowboy song  
It was a ditty, he learned in the city  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Get along, get hip little doggies  
Get along, better be on your way  
Get along, get hip little doggies  
And he trucked them on down the old fairway  
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Singin' his cowboy song  
He's just too much  
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Harlem touch  
He was raised on local weed  
He's what you call a swing half breed  
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Get along little doggie, better be on your way, your way,  
Get along little doggie  
And he trucked them on down the old fairway  
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah.  
  
Yip yip singing his cowboy song  
Yip yip as he was joggling along  
Yip yip he sings with a harlem touch  
Yip yip that guy is just too much  
Singing his cow cow boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yi yi yi yeah.
