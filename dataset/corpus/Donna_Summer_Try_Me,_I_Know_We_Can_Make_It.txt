Try me...  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, we can make it  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, we can make it  
  
You've got an easy way to make me cry  
My love for you  
And I can tell by the hungry way you look  
That you know just what to do  
  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, touch the sky  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, get on high  
  
I want to come up there with you right now  
And reach the stormy top  
I want to hold on tight with all my might  
And pray you'll never stop  
  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, touch the sky  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, get on high  
  
Try me I know we can make it  
I know if we try  
Try me I know we can make it  
I know if we try...
