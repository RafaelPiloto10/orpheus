The way you talk  
The things you've done  
Make me wish I  
Was the only one  
Who  
Could ever have made you laugh now  
Could have made you  
Made you want want to cry  
To have been there the day  
You first whispered "I love you"  
Yes I love you  
  
When you discover  
All those new things  
And when you first  
First met the world  
When you felt beautiful  
And you said hello(owowow)  
To everything you saw  
If I could have been all  
So I could have known you all those times  
I love you  
Yes, I love you  
Yes I do
