I brush my teeth, I dry my hair  
I put on skimpy underwear  
And I ride  
To hell and back  
Yeah I ride  
Carving up the nation  
Or the nearest service station  
I ride  
  
My leathers rip my tits  
... (drowned out by loud laughter) ...  
And I ride  
To hell and back  
And I ride  
  
... means a lot to me  
And I ride  
  
... (track degenerates wildly!) ...  
  
What's the problem?  
What? it's only tits.  
Jen!  
Don't follow me  
Jen!  
Don't be afraid of my bosom
