Blame me  
Save a prayer for those who haunt you  
There now  
I don't mind if you still love me  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Shame me  
Hide your heart from those who hunt you  
Way down (down, down)  
Would you care if I still need her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Save me  
Taken far from those who flaunt you  
Calm down  
Drag your heart and you behind her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone
