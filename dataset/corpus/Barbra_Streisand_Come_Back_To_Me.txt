Hear my voice where you are  
Take a train, steal a car  
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me  
Catch a plane, catch a breeze  
On your hands, on your knees  
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me  
On a mule, in a jet  
With your hair in a net  
In a towel when you're wet  
I don't care, this is where you should be  
  
From the hills, from the shore  
Ride the wind to my door  
Turn the high with the dust  
Break the law if you must  
Move the world, only just come back to me  
  
Blast you high, hear me call  
Must i fight city hall  
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me  
What on earth must i do  
Scream and yell till i'm blue  
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?  
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon  
At your rack, at your room  
Mademoiselle, where in hell can you be?  
  
Leave a sign on your door  
Out to lunch ever more  
In a royce or a van, wrapped in mink coats or rain  
Anyway that you can, come back to me  
Hear my voice through the dim  
Feel the waves on your skin  
Like a call from within, come back to me  
Leave behind all your own  
Tell your flowers you will phone  
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me  
  
Let your tub overflow  
If a date waits below  
Let him wait for godot  
By the rail,  
Come by mail, cod  
Par avion, par bateau  
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux  
  
Come by steam, come by gas  
Call for free on a pass  
On the drags and the glass, come back to me  
Leave your bills all unpaid  
Let your bed go unmade  
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me  
Come by sail, come by freight  
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate  
I don't care this is where you should be  
  
Come in pain or in joy  
As a girl, as a boy  
In a bag or a trunk (shut up!)  
On a horse or a drunk  
In the flora or faun, come back to me  
Come back to me, come back...  
  
"daisy"  
"will you stop bothering me?"  
"why, daisy, you're a bloody miracle!"
