Well, I've seen all there is to see  
And I've heard all they have to say  
I've done everything I wanted to do . . .  
I've done that too  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
Ain't that pretty at all  
So I'm going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
You know, I just had a short vacation, Roy  
Spent it getting a root canal  
"Oh, how'd you like it?"  
Well, it ain't that pretty at all  
So I'm going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
Gonna get a good running start and throw myself at the wall as hard as I can
man  
I've been to Paris  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
I've been to Rome  
Guess what?  
I'd like to go back to Paris someday and visit the Louvre Museum  
Get a good running start and hurl myself at the wall  
Going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than feel nothing at all  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
Ain't that pretty at all
