Watch out big ships are waiting  
Salt frozen on your cheek  
I saw a girl and boy arriving  
And a steamer put out to sea  
  
Tall tree stand in the distance  
Remember when you were green  
Don't wipe the salt from your skin  
You must keep running the distance  
  
Sun sleeps on misty morning  
Light years from channel three  
I fell halfway to zero  
Call me a hero I might just agree  
  
Tall tree stand in the distance  
Remember when you were green  
Don't wipe the salt from your skin  
You must keep running the distance  
  
And the roses you grow  
Have a powerful scent  
They'll be breaking your heart  
By the morning  
  
I feel halfway to zero  
Call me a hero I might just agree  
  
Tall tree stand in the distance  
Remember when you were green  
Don't wipe the salt from your skin  
Tall tree, tall tree  
Don't wipe the salt from your skin  
You must keep running the distance  
Tall tree
