Born into somewhere unseen and unknown  
Just like a worder so small and alone  
Take me away into your innocent dreams  
Maybe I'd see what it all means  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling  
  
It's so sad and so true  
but what can I do  
Owly a few years then it's up to you  
To care for yourself,  
I hope I gave good advice  
For all your life How to survive  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling
