There's wheat in the field  
And water in the stream  
And salt in the mine  
And an aching in me  
  
I can no longer stand and wonder  
'Cos I'm driven by this hunger  
So I'll jug some water  
Bake some flour  
Store some salt and wait the hour  
  
While I'm thinking of love  
Love is thinking for me  
And the baker will come  
And the baker I'll be  
  
I am depending on my labour  
The texture and the flavour
