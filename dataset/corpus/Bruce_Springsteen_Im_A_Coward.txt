I ain't afraid of no lions  
I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear  
I got in a wrestlin' match with old king kong  
He didn't even muss my hair  
There's just one thing in the whole wide world  
That make me doubt my stuff  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
Now bring down old hulk hogan  
King kong bundy too  
Bring down old big mike tyson  
I'll show them what a real man can do  
They say the tougher' get goin'  
Now baby that's when the goin' get tough  
  
But I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
You can bring on a different sexy girl  
At every night of the week  
Buddy that's okay  
But I start tremblin', my knees get weak  
Whenever I hear her say  
"do you love me baby? "  
"do you love me baby? "  
"do you love me baby? "  
  
I got a muscle of iron  
I got another muscle made of steel  
But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'  
You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world  
But buddy, that ain't enough  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love
