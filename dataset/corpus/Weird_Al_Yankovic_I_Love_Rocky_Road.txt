I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool  
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school  
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin' old  
Vanilla just leaves me cold  
  
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me  
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon  
I know what I need  
  
Baby, I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me, ow  
  
They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same  
All the soda jerkers know my name  
When their supply is gone  
Then I'll be movin' on  
  
But I'll be back on Monday afternoon, you'll see  
Another truck load's comin' in for me, all for me  
I'm singin'  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me, ow  
  
(Oh, make it talk)  
  
When I'm all alone, I just grab myself a cone  
And if I get fat and loose my teeth that's fine with me  
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key  
Sing it  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me
