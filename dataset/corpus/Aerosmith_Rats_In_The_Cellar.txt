Goin' under, rats in the cellar  
Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow  
Nose is runny, losin' my connection  
Losin' money, getting no affection  
  
New York City blues  
East side, West side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart  
  
Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten  
Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten  
Feelin' cozy, rats in the cellar  
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow  
Loose and soggy, lookin' mighty lazy  
Super party, pushin up a-daisies  
  
New York City schools  
East side, west side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart
