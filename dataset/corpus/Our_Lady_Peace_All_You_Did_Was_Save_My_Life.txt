You, looked at me as you walked in the room  
Like the red sea, you split me open  
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen  
All you did was save my life  
  
Tried to run but I couldn't move  
Well I paid for these concrete shoes  
But like a singer that sings the blues  
You saw hope in the hopeless  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not dying  
All you did was save my life  
Pulled me out of that flat line  
Put the heartbeat back inside  
I'm not dying  
All you did was get me through  
I owe every breath to you  
Heart and soul unparalyzed  
All you did was save my life  
  
Save my life  
  
I'm not for sale but I've been sold  
The more I hear the less I know  
And the lies are swallowed whole  
In their insignificance  
The story's been told a million times  
But it's different when it's your life  
I won the lottery tonight  
The lottery tonight  
The lottery tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I started to come around  
The dogs are backing down  
I'm not afraid to see  
  
The devil's gone underground  
This tightrope's been cut down  
And I can finally breathe  
  
You, looked at me as you walked in the room  
Like the red sea you split me open  
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All you did was save my life  
(Put the heart beat back inside)  
All you did was save my life  
(Put the heart beat back inside)  
All you did was save my life.
