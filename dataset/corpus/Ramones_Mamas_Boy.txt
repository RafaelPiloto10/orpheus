Couldn't keep a secret  
Got a concrete skull  
Couldn't shut up  
You're an imbecile  
You're an ugly dog  
There's nothing to gain  
You couldn't shut up  
Got a bad bad brain  
  
Couldn't hold your tongue  
You were just too young  
Like a two year old  
You told you told  
You are all the same jelly  
Bean brain  
Every one's a secret nerd.  
Every one's closet lame  
  
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mama's boy  
Don't want to work in a hot dog stand  
Be a busboy messenger or a doorman  
It's an abstract world  
You're an abstract man  
Abstract city don't give a damn
