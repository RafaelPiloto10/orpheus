Watching people roll by  
Wonder where they're going  
Hey, what's your job?  
What're you knowing?  
  
Driving to the grocery store  
Pull my money out  
Passing by the liquor store  
Throw my money down  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
  
My wife's got the blues  
Now I've got them  
Gonna bring her a kiss  
Make those blues run  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
  
The sun came out the other day  
Through those dusty clouds  
And in my mind I was a child  
And it felt good!  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand
