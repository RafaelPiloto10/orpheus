(The river must flow)  
I love you, you're the one that I adore  
And no man could love you more  
It's like a river that flows to the sea  
I need you like the jasmine needs the rain  
Let your water cool my pain  
Just like a river that flows to the sea  
through love I will find the meaning of you  
All my natural dreams will come true  
It's like a river that flows to the sea  
through love I will find a meaning in life  
But the rain must fall down tonight  
And like a river that flows to the sea  
Oh yeah, the river must flow from me  
(The river must flow)  
From me  
(The river must flow)  
You're a falling star burning in my heart  
Ah,ah  
through love I will find the meaning of you  
All my nat'ral dreams will come true  
It's like a river that flows to the sea  
through love I will find a meaning in life  
But the rain must fall down tonight  
And like a river that flows to the sea  
Oh yeah, the river must flow from me  
(The river must flow)  
From me  
(The river must flow)  
(The river must flow)  
(The river must flow)  
From me (The river must flow)  
From me (The river must flow)
