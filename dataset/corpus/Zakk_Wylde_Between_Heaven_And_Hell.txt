Dying to live  
Living to die  
Ain't no hellos here  
Nothing but goodbye  
It's like singing a song that cannot be sung  
It's like having to end child,  
What's yet to love begun  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, hey, hey now  
Where I am at times I just can't tell  
Hey, hey, hey, now  
I'm lost somewhere between heaven and hell  
  
All that you know and all that you knew  
In the end child,  
Tell me what's it all mean to you?  
Don't forget just who and where you are  
You can spread your wings son  
But don't you spread yourself too far  
  
Hey, hey, hey now  
Where I am at times I just can't tell  
Hey, hey, hey, now  
I'm lost somewhere between heaven and hell
