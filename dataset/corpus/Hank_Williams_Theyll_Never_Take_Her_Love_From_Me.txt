If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is one who's smiling face the Gods would see  
Cause she'll walk along beside me up to golden stairs  
Oh they'll never never take her love from me  
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave  
And to see her love turn into sympathy  
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave  
Oh they'll never never take her love from me  
[ steel ]  
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness  
That we shared together in the used to be  
Someone else's arms may hold her now in uncaress  
But they'll never never take her love from me  
I thought I'd make her happy if I'd step aside  
But I knew her love would never set me free  
And even on the day that she became another's bride  
I'll say they'll never never take her love from me  
No they'll never never take her love from me
