It's over now, gotta face it one last time  
We'll never make it work, heaven knows we tried  
Living this life, holdin' on for so long  
I know it won't be easy, but it's time to be strong  
  
Chorus:  
Walk away, walk away  
Don't you wait a minute longer  
Walk away from the love we know is wrong  
Walk away, walk away  
Do it now while I can find the strength to say  
Leave me now, before my heart won't let you  
Walk away  
  
You and I, never wanted it to end  
Just have to find a way, to start livin' again  
Oh, love of my life, I don't want to let you go  
Leave behind the memories, a forever that we'll never know  
  
Chorus:  
  
Ya know we can't go on, ya know the reason why  
That don't make it any easier, when it comes to saying  
Good-bye  
Walk away, walk away  
Do it now while I can find the strength to say  
Leave me now  
Before my heart won't let you...  
  
Chorus:
