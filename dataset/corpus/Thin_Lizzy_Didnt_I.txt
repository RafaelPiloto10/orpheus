Well I thought I could make you cry  
Oh didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
Ah did you, did you true?  
And I told you before  
When you walked out that door  
That I wouldn't love you any more  
I cannot cope any more  
  
Well I thought you'd never lie  
Why didn't I?  
I didn't think that you'd be untrue  
Well did you, did you too?  
And I've told you before  
When you'd walk out that door  
That I would no cope any more  
I do not have you any more  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried now didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
But it wasn't true, I do  
And I told you before  
A million times or more  
That when you'd walk out that door  
I would no love you any more  
I do not love you any more  
  
I lied now didn't I?  
Oh didn't I?  
  
There are people in this town  
That say I don't give a damn  
But the people in this town  
They never could understand  
Oh they never could understand  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried, now didn't I? Didn't I try, didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
But it wasn't true, I do, I do  
And I told you before  
That you'd open up my sores  
And you'd leave me here with scars  
I cannot take it any more  
Oh don't hurt me no more  
  
I cried and I cried, now didn't I?  
Why didn't I try? why didn't I?
