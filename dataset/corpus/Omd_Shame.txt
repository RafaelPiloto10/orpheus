If there's one thing I know  
Things are gonna change  
There's gonna be a different ending  
Though I'm not one to complain  
  
But there's never been a right time  
And we've never been too far  
But you're the only single reason I know  
That's holding back my heart  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
And the second time  
Just wouldn't be the same  
But you're changing with your faces and  
You're gonna be lost again  
If you're with or without me  
I've made up my mind  
Well I'm hpoping and praying  
But you're running out of time  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
God know it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
God know it's a shame  
But it's always, it's always the way
