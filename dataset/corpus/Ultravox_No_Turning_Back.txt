You think you're so safe and secure with your kind  
But don't be surprised if you're losing this time  
Learn to stand on your own  
Realise, and believe in yourself  
'Cause I won't be waiting  
Chorus:  
I hate to leave  
But there's no turning back  
You may think that I'm wrong but hear what I'm saying  
You have to believe  
There's no turning back  
I know where I belong, I can't go on waiting  
I watch as the tears fall colliding down your face  
Stand up to your fear now before it gets too late  
I won't be here at your side I pray  
Get a hold on yourself  
'Cause I won't be waiting  
(Chorus)
