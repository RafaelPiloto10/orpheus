Say goodbye to all your pain and sorrow  
Say goodbye to all those lonely nights  
Say goodbye to all your blue tomorrows  
Now you're standing in the light  
  
I know sometimes you feel so helpless  
Sometimes you feel like you can't win  
Sometimes you feel so isolated  
You'll never have to feel that way again  
  
You are not alone  
You're not alone  
  
Never thought I'd find the road to freedom  
Never thought I'd see you smile again  
Never thought I'd have the chance to tell you  
That I will always be your friend  
  
You are not alone  
You're not alone
