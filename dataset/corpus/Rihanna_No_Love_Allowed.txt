911 it's a critical emergency  
Better run run run come and charge him with the 143  
Told me his world was mine  
Such a beautiful lie  
Now he's done done done and this love is no more for me  
  
Hand inna the air as he waves me goodbye  
He said he care but no tears in his eyes  
And ask me if I'm alright  
Nigga is you blind  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us  
I call it murder, no love allowed  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Fi-fo-fum like the sky has fallen down on me  
Numb numb numb, he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing  
  
Broken heart was the case  
Wanna put him away  
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me  
  
Hand inna the air as he waved me goodbye  
He said he care but no tears in his eyes  
And asked me if I'm alright  
Nigga is you blind  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us  
I call it murder, no love allowed  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Usually I'm the one that they cry for  
But this man he's the one that I'd die for  
Mama said there's no cause for a rebel  
Do you hear me now  
  
Oh oh oh no love, no love, no love allowed  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us  
I call it murder, no love allowed
