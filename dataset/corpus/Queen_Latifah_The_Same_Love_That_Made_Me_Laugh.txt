Come on now, I'm the one you love  
I'm the one you can't breathe without remember  
Why you wanna make me cry like this?  
Why is you wanna make me cry?  
Why me?  
Your love is like a chunk of gold  
Hard to gain, hard to hold  
Like a rose that's soft to touch  
Love has gone and it hurts so much  
Well then why...  
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?  
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain  
Think about it being a great big rock  
Won't you think before you started to roll it down  
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop  
I've given all I have to give  
And if you don't want me, baby  
I don't want to live  
Well then why...  
Oh, why  
Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?  
Why you wanna make me cry? [5x]  
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow  
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow  
Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry  
You use to be so soft and sweet to me  
And now you act so wrong and mean to me  
Now you get so wrong and mean to me  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Oh, why you wanna mess my pillow  
You got me cryin' like a weeping willow  
Wanna make me cry  
Oh, why, oh, why  
Why why why why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Ooh, why
