I've been down the Mississippi,  
Down through New Orleans,  
Yes, I have.  
I've played in California,  
  
There ain't too much I haven't seen.  
No, there ain't.  
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man.  
  
Left a girl in West Virginia,  
Up there where that green grass grows,  
Yes, I did.  
Another girl in Cincinnati,  
  
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows,  
Poor girl!  
I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man.  
  
You'd better move away,  
You're standin' too close to the flame.  
Once I mess with your mind,  
Your little heart won't beat the same.  
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,  
  
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.  
Better not!  
Well, up in Chicago,  
I was known as "Quiet Boy,"  
  
Yes, I was!  
Down in Alabama,  
They call me "The man of joy,"  
Still do!  
  
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man.  
You'd better move away,  
You're standin' too close to the flame.  
  
Once I mess with your mind,  
Your little heart won't beat the same.  
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.
