(Mother?)  
(Mother?)  
Well as the city nights grow cold  
The lights jump through the shutters  
  
And a thousand echos fill the streets  
And bounce along the dirty gutters  
(Out there)  
I know that he's waiting for me  
  
(Somewhere)  
I know that he's waiting there for me  
I watched her falling to the ground  
And saw the glass go flying  
  
And inside her mind the fuse blew out  
But deep inside a voice was crying  
(Out there)  
I know that he's waiting for me  
  
(Somewhere)  
I know that he's waiting there  
Look out for the Bladerunner  
I thought I heard him calling you  
  
And now a silence fills the room  
I feel my heart start beating  
'Cause inside the shadows there he stands  
He's waiting on our final meeting  
  
(Out there)  
I know that he'd waited for me  
(Somewhere)  
I know that he'd waited there for me
