Train arrive 16 coaches long  
Train arrive 16 coaches long  
Well, that long black train  
Took my baby back home  
Train train, rolling round the bend  
Train train, rolling round the bend  
Well, it took my baby  
Away from me again  
Went down to the station  
To meet my baby at the gate  
Ask the station master  
If her train is running late  
He said no if your wait  
On that old 44  
I hate to tell you son  
But that train don't stop her anymore  
Train train, rolling round the bend  
Train train, rolling round the bend  
Well, it took my baby  
Away from me again  
Heard that whistle blowing  
It was the middle of the night  
When I got down to the station  
The train was rolling out of site  
Mystery train, rolling round the bend  
Mystery train, rolling round the bend  
Well, it took my baby  
Away from me again
