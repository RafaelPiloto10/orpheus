Got a pot belly,  
It's not too big  
Gets in my way  
When I'm driving my rig  
  
Driving this country  
In a big old rig  
Things I've seen  
Mean a lot  
  
Friend has a pickup  
Drives his kid to school  
Then he takes his wife  
To beauty school  
  
Now she's doin' nails  
Gonna get a job  
Got a good teacher  
  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
I don't which way I'm gonna turn  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
  
About this year  
We salute the troops  
They're all still there  
In a fucking war  
It's no good  
Whose idea was that?  
  
I've got hope  
But you can't eat hope  
I'm not done  
Not giving up  
Not cashing in  
Too late  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
It's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
  
I'm a big rock star  
My sales have tanked  
But I still got you  
Thanks

Sounds like shit  
  
Keep on bloggin'  
'Til the power goes out  
Your battery's dead  
Twist and shout  
  
On the radio  
Those were the days  
Bring 'em back  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
Bailout coming but it's not for you  
  
Got my flat screen  
Got it repo'd now  
They picked it up  
Left a hole in the wall  
Last Saturday  
Missed the Raiders game  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do
