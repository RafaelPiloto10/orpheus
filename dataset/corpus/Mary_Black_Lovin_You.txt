I have been wond'ring  
What I'm gonna do  
While you are sleeping  
Am I sleeping too  
Well I'm just sittin' here lovin' you  
Close my eyes and lovin' you  
Oh I'm just sittin' back  
Sittin' here lovin' you  
  
If you've been wond'rin  
Just what I would do  
If I weren't sleeping  
Had I not found you  
Well I'd be outside finding you  
I'd be walkin' down avenue finding you  
Oh I'm just sittin' here lovin' you  
  
Oh the reason that you never see me runnin' round  
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down  
And I can't even get me up and on my feet  
I have to take care of some bus'ness on the street  
Oh I have been walkin' all my streets alone  
I'd keep on walkin' to keep from goin' home  
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you  
Now I can't conceive of ever leavin' you  
Oh I'm just stittin' back  
Sittin' here lovin' you  
  
Oh I'm just sittin' here lovin' you  
Oh I'm just sittin' back  
Sittin' here lovin' you
