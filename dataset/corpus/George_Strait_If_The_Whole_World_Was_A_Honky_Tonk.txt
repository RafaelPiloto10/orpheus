If the whole world was a honky-tonk,  
And it revolved around an old jukebox,  
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,  
Over cryin' steel guitars,  
And soon, they'd all be gone.  
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
You could smoke that cigarette,  
An' be politically incorrect.  
Show off that red 'round your neck:  
Not hear a single soul object.  
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,  
Who is wrong and who is right.  
No need for big expensive trials:  
Brother, we'd just step outside.  
  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,

Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
Wouldn't have to pay no tax:  
Just set a tip jar in the back.  
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:  
I bet we'd all be in the black,  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.  
  
And if you're lookin' love:  
Someone to heal that broken heart.  
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.  
You wouldn't have to go that far.  
  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,  
And it revolved around an old jukebox,  
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,  
Over cryin' steel guitars,  
And soon, they'd all be gone.  
If you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
Life would be a three-chord song,  
And the king would be George Jones,  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.
