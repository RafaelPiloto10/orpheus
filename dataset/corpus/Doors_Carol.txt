Oh, Carol!  
Don't let him steal your heart away.  
Yeah I've got to love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
Beat cool down,  
Over cool down,  
I can hear that highway sound.  
  
Carol!  
Don't let him steal your heart away.  
Well I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
  
Whoa, Carol!  
Oh, Carol!  
Don't let him steal your heart away.  
Yeah I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
  
One more time!  
Whoa, Carol!  
Come on, Carol!  
Oh yeah!  
Oh right!  
Well I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.
