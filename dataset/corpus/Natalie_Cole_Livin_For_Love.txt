Who do you love when your heart has had enough  
And its just another lie, and all you can do is cry  
Where can you go when you're left with just too much  
And its' more than you can take, gotta find another way  
  
'Cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more  
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down  
Fed up, messed up, I still get up I'm gonna keep on  
(livin' for love) no one can stop me from (livin' for love) hey, hey, hey  
(livin' for love) who do you trust when you've given all you've got  
  
And there's nothing left inside but another damn goodbye  
Hey, how do you know if it's just another night  
And you're heart won't be betrayed then you face another day  
'cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more  
  
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down  
Fed up, messed up, I still get up (livin' for love) cause I'm livin' for love  
(livin' for love) no one can stop me from  
(livin' for love) no one can hold me from (livin' for love) I'm livin'  
(livin' for love) I'm livin' for love (livin' for love) oh, yes, I am, are you  
(livin' for love) because I'm livin' for love why'all  
  
Jacked up, backed up, cracked up, fed up, talked up, messed up, I still get up  
'Cause I'm livin' for love, ooh, ooh (livin for love, livin) livin  
(livin for love, livin for love) no on can stop me from  
(livin for love, livin) uh huh I'm gonna keep (livin for love, livin for love)  
  
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down  
Fed up, messed up, I still get up (livin' for love) sha da da da da  
(livin' for love) whoa whoa whoa whoa (livin' for love) no one can stop me  
(livin' for love)i may be tore down, wore down  
  
Fed up, messed up, backed up(livin' for love)  
Stepped on, splattered on (livin' for love for love)  
I may be broke down and beat down and tore down and wore down  
And fed up, and messed up but it's all right and you can kiss my  
(livin' for love) because I'm livin' for love why'all  
Never gonna give up, no
