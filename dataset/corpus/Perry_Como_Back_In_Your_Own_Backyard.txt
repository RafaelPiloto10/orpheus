The bird with feathers of blue is waiting for you  
Back in your own backyard  
You'll see your castle in Spain through your windowpane  
Back in your own backyard  
  
Oh, you can go to the east, go to the west  
But someday you'll come, weary at heart  
Back where you started from  
You'll find, your happiness lies right under your eyes  
Back in your own backyard
