I'm not feeling alright today  
I'm not feeling that great  
I'm not catching on fire today  
Love has started to fade  
I'm not going to smile today  
I'm not gonna laugh  
You're out living it up today  
I've got dues to pay  
  
And the gravedigger puts on the forceps  
The stonemason does all the work  
The barber can give you a haircut  
The carpenter can take you out to lunch  
  
Now I just want to play on my panpipes  
I just want to drink me some wine  
As soon as you're born you start dyin'  
So you might as well have a good time  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats...go to hell  
  
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip  
I don't wanna feel the emptiness  
Old marquees with stupid band names  
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip  
  
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip  
I don't wanna feel the emptiness  
Old marquees with stupid band names  
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip  
  
And the gravedigger puts on the forceps  
The stonemason does all the work  
The barber can give you a haircut  
The carpenter can take you out to lunch  
  
Now but I just want to play on my panpipes  
I just want to drink me some wine  
As soon as you're born you start dyin'  
So you might as well have a good time  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats...go to hell  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats...go to hell  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats...go to hell
