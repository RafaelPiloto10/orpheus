[Verse 1]  
Crank it up, yo, and let me hear that system bump  
'cause with this here I gotta get over the hump  
And you know what that means (that means)  
Kickin' out funky rhymes "G" (rhymes "G")  
I got the funky rhymes that'll please (that'll please)  
And my jams break overseas (overseas)  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
'cause when the mic's turned on I get psyched up (psyched up)  
The V.I.P. gets it started with intro  
Bustin' smooth moves on top of instrumental  
Turn up the beats in the Jeeps louder  
Here we go y'all - with minutes of power  
Minutes of power  
[Verse 2]  
Minutes of power  
When I step to the mic - bro  
Vanilla Ice does it right  
And what I'm sayin' is - Yo!  
Ya suckers frontin' what ya wantin' is for me to fade  
Thought I was outta here fools  
I ain't goin' away  
Back with the track that will keep my bank fat  
HA! Vanilla's got the flavor for the funky format  
And if you're not givin' up the credit I seek  
VIP's in the house and they're ready to creep  
Now whatcha gonna do when my boys are on you?  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
So turn it up for the passengers - LOUDER!  
It's Vanilla Killa with the Minutes of Power  
[Verse 3]  
Walk through the smoke on the stage  
And the girls scream  
Ice gets 'em hot, then they melt like ice cream  
Flowin' with the swiftness  
Kickin' it with the quickness  
Fella's gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When I'm rolllin' around in my 5.0 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
'cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin' mad 'cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I won't quit  
Ice has got it locked down and there's no stoppin' it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that I'll be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet, it could never be sour  
Here we go y'all with the  
M.......minutes of power  
[Verse 4]  
Now's the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin' up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin' all enemies, you're not even a friend of me  
I ain't Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing, G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I don't think so  
Travel state to state an' and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin' in my path an' you might get broken  
I got it goin' on an' you know I ain't jokin  
Power every hour an' the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin' out arenas so don't look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an' the place explodes  
An' if ya missed it - catch the next episode!  
Gather up your troops  
Rush 'em to the record store  
An' pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha - hit cha - hit cha  
With the, with the  
Minutes (x3) Minutes of Power
