What have you achieved now you're old  
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told  
Or are you still doing the same this year  
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer  
  
I know that the prospects weren't all that good  
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could  
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside  
Not let it vanish, along with your pride  
  
Now with the aid of your new walking stick  
You hobble along through society thick  
And look mesmerized by the face of it all  
You keep to the gutter in case you fall  
  
I can't go on  
I can't go on  
I can't go on  
I can't go on  
  
I, I, I, I
