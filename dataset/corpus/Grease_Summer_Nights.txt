[Danny]  
Summer lovin' had me a blast  
  
[Sandy]  
Summer lovin' happened so fast  
  
[Danny]  
I met a girl crazy for me  
  
[Sandy]  
Met a boy cute as can be  
  
[Both]  
Summer days driftin' away, to uh-oh those summer nights  
  
[Everyone]  
Uh Well-a well-a well-a huh  
  
[Thunderbirds]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Doody]  
Did you get very far?  
  
[Pink Ladies]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Marty]  
Like does he have a car?  
  
[Everyone]  
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh  
  
[Danny]  
She swam by me, she got a cramp  
  
[Sandy]  
He ran by me, got my suit damp  
  
[Danny]  
I saved her life, she nearly drowned  
  
[Sandy]  
He showed off, splashing around  
  
[Both]  
Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights  
  
[Everyone]  
Uh well-a well-a well-a huh  
  
[Pink Ladies]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Frenchy]  
Was it love at first sight?  
  
[Thunderbirds]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Kenickie]  
Did she put up a fight?  
  
[Everyone]  
Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh  
  
[Danny]  
Took her bowling in the arcade  
  
[Sandy]  
We went strolling, drank lemonade  
  
[Danny]  
We made out under the dock  
  
[Sandy]  
We stayed out 'till ten o'clock  
  
[Both]  
Summer fling, don't mean a thing, but uh-oh those summer nights  
  
[Everyone]  
Uh well-a well-a well-a huh  
  
[Thunderbirds]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Putzie]  
But you don't gotta brag  
  
[Pink Ladies]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Rizzo]  
Cause he sounds like a drag  
  
[Everyone]  
Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop
bop, shoo-bop bop, YEH  
  
[Sandy]  
He got friendly, holding my hand  
  
[Danny]  
While she got friendly down in the sand  
  
[Sandy]  
He was sweet, just turned eighteen  
  
[Danny]  
Well she was good you know what I mean  
  
[Everyone]  
Woah!  
  
[Both]  
Summer heat, boy and girl meet, but uh-oh those summer nights  
  
[Everyone]  
Woo, woo, woo  
  
[Pink Ladies]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[ Jan]  
How much dough did he spend?  
  
[Thunderbirds]  
Tell me more, tell me more  
  
[Sonny]  
Could she get me a friend?  
  
[Sandy]  
It turned colder - that's where it ends  
  
[Danny]  
So I told her we'd still be friends  
  
[Sandy]  
Then we made our true love vow  
  
[Danny]  
Wonder what she's doing now  
  
[Both]  
Summer dreams ripped at the seams,  
Bu-ut oh, those su-ummer nights...  
  
[Everyone]  
Tell me more, tell me more!
