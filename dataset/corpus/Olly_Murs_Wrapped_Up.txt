Now excuse if I sound rude  
But I love the way that you move  
And I see me all over you now  
Baby when I look in your eyes  
There's no way that I can disguise  
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now  
There's just something about you got the lock  
I got the key  
You know the rest  
You know just where I wanna be  
Don't ever stop controlling me  
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees  
  
You got me wrapped up  
Around your finger  
I'd do anything for your love now  
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I can't come down  
You got me wrapped up baby  
  
I don't ever wanna give up  
All this spell you got me under  
I see fireworks when we touch now  
There's just something about you  
Your body fits on mine like a glove  
Let them say whatever they want  
It's too late cause you're in my blood now  
You got the lock  
I got the key  
You know the rest  
You know just where I wanna be  
Don't ever stop controlling me  
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees  
  
You got me wrapped up  
Around your finger  
I'd do anything for your love now  
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I can't come down  
Girl, You got me wrapped up  
You got me so, so wrapped up  
There's just something about you wrapped up  
You got me so, so wrapped up  
There's just something about you

My princess so intelligent  
Make me wanna reapply to school for the hell of it  
I'll be the student, you be the teacher  
Ms. Sophisticated, such a pleasure to meet ya  
Yeah, but here's the only issue since we met  
You kinda turned my world upside down  
And I don't really mind spiderman kissing you  
As long as you're planning on sticking around  
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me  
Not a chance nobody came close to 'em  
I kinda knew you was troublesome  
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum  
  
Everything that you do  
Every way that you move  
There's just something about you  
There's just something about you  
Everything that you do  
Every way that you move  
There's just something about you  
  
Girl you got me wrapped up  
Around your finger  
I'd do anything for your love now  
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I can't come down  
Girl, You got me wrapped up  
You got me so, so wrapped up  
There's just something about you wrapped up  
You got me so, so wrapped up  
There's just something about you
