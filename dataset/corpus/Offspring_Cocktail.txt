When building a molotov cocktail,  
Don't think of it as "Just a bomb".  
Be creative, express yourself  
Put a little bit of yourself in each one  
But remember kids, safety first.... Ok! Lets get started!  
Take an empty milk bottle  
Full it full with gasoline  
Stuff a gassed soap rag into the mouth of the bottle  
You cork the top and presto!  
You're gonna have a fun-filled night tonight, believe me  
You're gonna be the life of the party,  
With this little goodie.  
Be safe kids, and have a blast
