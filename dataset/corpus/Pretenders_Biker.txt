Biker they tell me  
You're a dangerous love  
Well that might be true  
Oh, but I'd never ride with another  
  
Maybe they've never had  
Their arms around  
Anything so wild and free  
  
You bring the biker out in me  
  
I can't understand it  
Why people give you grief  
You play the one-armed bandit  
Like an outlaw with a belief  
To them it's the norm for  
A man to conform  
To a godless society  
  
You bring the biker out in me  
You bring the biker out in me  
  
Because they've no interest  
In the struggle to obtain  
The status and bogus desires  
That drive most people insane  
You who have nothing  
Have something that only the one percent  
Could ever see  
  
You bring the biker out in me  
You bring the biker out in me
