There was a world outside my door  
I wasn't in touch with anymore  
There was a way I used to feel  
I knew what was and wasn't real  
  
You built a bridge, I tore it down  
I felt safe on shaky ground  
And I was a master of despair  
Making believe I didn't care  
  
[Chorus]  
I shouldn't be standing here today  
After all the crazy things I've done  
I'm ready to fall and that's OK  
I ran as far as I could run  
You won  
  
Out of a world turned upside down  
It took some time to come around  
Out of a dream you made me whole  
Yes you did  
You lit a fire down in my soul  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And you won  
  
I'm ready to fall  
I thought I knew what I was doing  
I thought I was in control  
I thought nobody could slow me down  
But what did I know  
I was just a kid, a motherless child  
No one to watch over me I was runnin' wild  
Free of all responsibility 'til my life  
And my love for myself caught up with me  
Yeah, it caught up with me  
And now I'm (ready to fall), yes I am  
So ready
