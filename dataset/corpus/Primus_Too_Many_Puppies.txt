Too many puppies are being shot in the dark.  
Too many puppies are trained not to bark.  
At the sight of blood that must be spilled so that we may maintain  
Our oil fields.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies are taught to heal.  
Too many puppies are trained to kill.  
On the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses  
Sleek animal pelts.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies.  
Too many puppies with guns in their hands.  
Too many puppies in foreign lands.  
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine.  
Too many puppies are just like me.  
Too many puppies are afraid to see.  
The visions of the past brought to life again,  
Too many puppies, too many dead men.
