There's so many things  
I didn't say  
And even though  
It may be too late  
I want you to know  
I still love you so  
Every car I meet  
Looks like your car  
Every movie I see  
You play the leading part  
You're on my mind  
Can't leave you behind  
  
When I close my eyes  
You're all I see  
In the dark of night  
You're in my dreams  
Throughout the day  
You're easy to find  
You're always there  
When I close my eyes  
  
In my mind I know  
You're far away  
But here in my heart  
Nothing has changed  
I'm still holdin' you  
Like I used to  
On a busy street  
In a crowded room  
Wherever I go  
It's just me and you  
Together again  
Girl it never ends  
  
When I close my eyes  
You're all I see  
In the dark of night  
You're in my dreams  
Throughout the day  
You're easy to find  
You're always there  
When I close my eyes  
  
You're always there  
When I close my eyes
