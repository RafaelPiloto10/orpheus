They've got it better than when anyone's told ya,  
I'll be the King of Hearts, you're the Queen of Spades  
And we'll fight for you like we were soldiers  
  
I know we've got it good  
But they've got it made  
And the grass is getting greener each day

I said, everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going  
Yeah, we're going down  
  
Do you think I'm special, do you think I'm nice  
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces  
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like  
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces  
  
It can't be possible that rain can fall,  
Only when it's over our heads  
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away  
Over the world it's said, they've got, they've got  
  
All the right friends, in all the right places  
So yeah we're going down  
We got all the right moves in all the right places  
So yeah we're going down  
  
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going  
Yeah, we're going down  
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going  
Yeah, we're going down (going down, going down, going down, going down)  
  
It don't matter what you see  
I know I could never be  
Someone that'll look like you  
It don't matter what you say  
I know I could never face  
Someone that could sound like you
