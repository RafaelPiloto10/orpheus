I'd like to think about her  
And the way she used to love me  
But I just can't live without her  
'Cause her arms are not around me  
And the season's getting later  
And my body's getting colder  
And the vespers ring and I'm all alone  
Without my love beside me  
  
She'd call me in the evenin'  
And ask me to come over  
She'd be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
We'd talk a while and then she'd smile  
Then she'd lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more  
  
The bells would ring at six o'clock  
And she'd be in my arms  
Her head upon my shoulder, gently resting  
And then she'd wake and look at me  
Not knowing I'd been watching  
Kiss me softly, then drift off to sleep  
  
She'd call me in the evenin'  
And ask me to come over  
She'd be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
We'd talk a while and then she'd smile  
Then she'd lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more
