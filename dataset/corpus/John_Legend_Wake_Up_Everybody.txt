Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed  
No more backward thinkin' time for thinkin' ahead  
The world has changed so very much  
From what it used to be  
There is so much hatred war and poverty  
Oh yeah  
  
Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way  
Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say  
Cause they're the ones who's coming up  
And the world is in their hands  
When you teach the children  
Teach 'em the very best you can  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
The world won't get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world won't get no better  
We gotta change it yeah,  
Just you and me.  
  
Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well  
They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell  
But they don't have so very long before the Judgment Day  
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away.  
  
Wake up all the builders time to build a new land  
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand  
The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds  
Surely things will work out cause they do every time.  
  
The world won't get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world won't get no better  
We gotta change it yeah,  
Just you and me.  
  
Yeah, yeah  
  
It's the God hour  
The morning I wake up  
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker  
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers  
My mom buidin' on skyscrapers and acres  
He said take us back to where we belong  
I try to write a song  
As sweet as the Psalms  
Though I'm the type to bare arms  
And wear my heart on my sleeve  
Even when I fell in God I believe  
Read the days that weave through the maze  
The seasons so amazing  
Feed them and raised them  
Seasons are aging  
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors  
I want us to get by but  
We're more than consumers  
We more than shooters, more than looters  
Created in this image so God live through us  
And even in this generation, living through computers  
Only love love love can reboot us  
  
Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed  
Wake up, everybody  
Need a little help,  
Can't do it alone  
Need a little help y'all  
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon  
Need a little help, y'all  
Can't do it alone  
Need a little help, y'all  
Can't do it alone  
Oh, wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody
