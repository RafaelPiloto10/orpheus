You've got a plan that could never go wrong.  
You took advantage and the damage done.  
It all comes back to me, baby.  
It all comes back to me.  
  
I played the fool and I went off the track.  
And when I think of all it cost,  
When the dice was cast,  
You know I had to be crazy,  
You know I had to be.  
  
I've been telling lies,  
And you forgive me but my heart still cries.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide, to hide....  
  
I know I let you down in so many ways.  
I know that sorry doesn't tell you  
What you need me to say.  
But, I would die for you, baby.  
Yes, I would die for you.  
  
I've been in disguise.  
And you forgive me and our love will rise.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah,yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah, yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle.  
The only man.  
The fool of a man in the middle.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man.  
The only man.  
That stupid man.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide
