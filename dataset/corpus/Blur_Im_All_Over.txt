I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
I'm the only one  
I'm hanging around  
Going nowhere  
Waiting for it to happen to me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
You're the only one  
I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
You're the only one
