Ooh no no, no no no no  
  
I got two-dozen roses, and a card that says baby I can't wait to see you later  
We made dinner reservations, and no rules listen child you just pick the
location  
Now were sitting at the table sipping? the finest wine having a damn good time  
I know what's on your mind I want you,  
You want me too stop fronting I know exactly what you would you want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
Do it to me, I want to feel you touch my body baby, body baby  
Do it to me I guarantee you won't regret it let me set it out like you ain't
never had it  
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it  
When you want it when you all up on it oh  
Do it to me I'm gonna give it to you, I'm gonna make this a night to remember  
  
Watching you work the stick in the ride, the motion how you move from 3rd to 5  
And imagine what it's gonna be when we get inside  
And you put that ooh wee on me and you want me the same way, ooh I can't wait  
I'm tired of thinking about it, speaking about it, baby it's time to be about
it, turn off the lights, take off your clothes, jump in the bed, and let it
flow  
Squeeze and holdin' bitin' scratchin' spankin' screamin' pullin' my hair when
you need me everything goes baby when you?.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
So long I waited for this night to get inside you look in your eyes  
And tell you baby take me I'm yours  
And if you feel anything like I feel,  
By the end of the night I'm certain you'll be screamin' for more  
I want to do anything and everything to your body till you break down can't
take no more  
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs you gon? get it baby
please please  
Oh do it to me?.  
  
[Chorus]
