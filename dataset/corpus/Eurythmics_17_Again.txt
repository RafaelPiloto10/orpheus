Yay though we venture through  
The valley of the stars  
You and all your jewelry  
And my bleeding heart  
  
Who couldn't be together  
And who could not be apart  
  
We should've jumped out  
Of that airplane after all  
Flying sky ways overhead  
It wasn't hard to fall  
And I had so many crashes  
That I couldn't feel at all  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Times might break you  
God forsake you  
Leave you burned and bruised  
Innocence will teach you  
What it feels like to be used  
Thought that you'd done everything  
You didn't have a clue  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Looking from the outside in  
Some things never change  
Hey hey I'm a million miles away  
Funny how it seems like yesterday  
  
All those fake celebrities  
And all those viscous queens  
All the stupid papers  
And the stupid magazines  
Sweet dreams are made of anything  
That gets you in the scene  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
Yeah
