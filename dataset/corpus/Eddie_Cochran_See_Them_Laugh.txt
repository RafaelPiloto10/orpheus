See them laugh  
Watch them stare (watch them stare)  
They always do when I'm with you  
See, they say our love will never hold  
That you're too young and I'm too old  
And just the same. I don't feel blue  
'Cause I have you (I-I-I have you)  
See them laugh  
Why won't they (why won't they)  
Give us a chance for our romance  
See, although our age is not the same  
I love you so, I can't explain  
'Cause it don't matter what they say or do  
(I-I-I do) See
