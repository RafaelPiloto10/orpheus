Come with me  
Come with me  
Lose yourself  
Let love be  
  
I will lead you there keep you there  
Give my share and take my share  
Set you free  
If you will come with me  
  
Come with me  
Come with me  
And leave out fantasies  
We'll just take it slow as we go  
Enjoy it all as we fall  
Into love's stream  
If you will come with me  
  
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh  
Come with me  
Come with me  
I give love's guarantee  
It will turn you on  
  
Right or wrong  
Make you feel you belong  
Turn the key  
If you will come with me  
  
Come with me  
Come with me  
I give love's guarantee  
I will turn you on  
  
Right or wrong  
Make you feel you belong  
Turn the key  
If you will come with me  
  
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh...
