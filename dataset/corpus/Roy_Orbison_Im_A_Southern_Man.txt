Send me a pan of corn bread  
With some turnip greens on the side  
And if you really want to mess with my head  
Give me anything southern fried  
  
Give me some faded blue jeans  
And a pair of old cowboy boots  
And I'm gonna tell you where I come from  
Tell you somethin' about my roots  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
  
Send me a woman to love me  
With a lot of meat on her bones  
There's something about a big lady  
I just can't leave 'em alone  
  
I'd like to take her down to the river  
Go skinny dippin' in the night  
Ain't nothin' like being with my lady  
And makin' love in the pale moon light  
  
'Cause I'm a southern man, ah ah ah  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
I'm a southern man  
  
Give me that soulful music  
It sure makes me feel so nice  
So I can do the alligator  
And get it on every Saturday night  
  
Give me that Southern Comfort  
Give me Annie Greenspring's wine  
Take me on down to the bayou  
and I'll sure have a real good time  
  
'Cause I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man
