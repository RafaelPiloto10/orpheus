Oh, whoa no I can't pretend to tell you lies  
The heat that's burnin' thru' my veins  
Will eat your love alive  
Cos I-Yes I'm the devil in disguise  
The will is strong, the flesh is weak  
You see it in my eyes  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal,  
Half beast half man  
  
Oh, whoa no temptation's fever's burnin' me  
My hands will sweat, my lips will scream  
I take just what I need  
Cos I-I wanna run my hands on you  
My soul's alive, I feel the drive  
The sweetmeat's where I feed  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
  
Call of the wild I'm a lunatic child  
I wait in the bush, I watch you and smile  
Dinner's at eight, I can't hardly wait  
I'll eat you alive, baby don't you be late  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man
