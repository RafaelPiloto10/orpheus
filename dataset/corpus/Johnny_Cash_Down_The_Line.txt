Well you can't be my lovin' baby  
You ain't gotta style  
I'm gonna get some real good love  
Gonna drive those cool cats wild  
  
I'm gonna move, move on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Oh I'm gonna show you a-way so hot  
I'm gonna get what you ain't got  
She'll be cool, she'll be wrong  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll roll on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Why! come on now  
  
Yeah, Move on down the line  
Wanna get some love that's truly fine  
She'll be cool, she'll be long  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll, roll on down the line  
Gonna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Oh let's sing it again one time now  
  
Yeah, move on down the line  
Wanna get some love that's truly fine  
She'll be cool, she'll be long  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll, roll on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Yeah, move (Yeah gonna move)  
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)  
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)
