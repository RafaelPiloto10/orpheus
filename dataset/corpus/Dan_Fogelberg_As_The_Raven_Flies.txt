I see the raven's made  
Her nest in your eyes  
She's got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And you'll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
  
She'll bring you stories  
That just never sound true  
She'll bring you secrets  
That were never meant for you,  
And just as you come round  
She'll send you back through  
She's in love with you  
She's in love with you.  
  
Darker, darker  
Don't let her talk her way  
Into you.  
Lonely, lonely  
You know she's only  
No good for you.  
  
I see the raven's made  
Her nest in your eyes  
She's got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And you'll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies.
