You  
You turned and walk away  
I didn't know what to say  
I closed my eyes to hide  
The pain I felt inside  
I could never understand  
How love went out of hand  
And now there's nothing I can do  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now  
Now I'm left here all alone  
A heart without a home  
How will I ever find  
The love I left behind  
Once, the days were ours to share  
Now you don't even care  
And there's still nothing I can do  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now...  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now  
(Instrumental)  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now
