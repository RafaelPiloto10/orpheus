Oh, if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
A guy that stays true is hard one to find  
I've heard my old flame is now on your mind  
But if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
Has he told you of the joys that we knew?  
Or does he pretend he loves only you  
'Cause if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
Someday you'll know his love isn't real  
He'll come back to me and then how will you feel  
'Cause he'll cheat on you like he cheated on me  
So send him back now while your heart's still free  
'Cause if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
You'd be glad to let him go
