I'm getting off this carousel, you can do as you please, you can go to hell  
You put my back against the wall  
Well I'm not gonna fall on my knees, no not at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
So you're a saint, I'm a sinner, but deuces are wild  
Better wake up, it's break up, I ain't got the time  
  
So (baby) you can kiss my heart bye bye  
Next to you I feel I'm all alone, love's turned to stone, ooh yeah  
Cross my heart and hope to cry, well I'm not gonna die  
Without you it's aces high  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bye bye babe  
Kiss my heart bye bye, you missed my heart this time around  
Kiss my heart bye bye, and I don't need no one at all, no!  
There's no right and there's no wrong, I'm moving on  
I'll go it alone, because love's turned to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So bye bye babe, bye bye babe  
No I'm not gonna die, cross my heart and hope to cry  
No no no no I'm not gonna die, so bye bye bye babe  
Well I'm not gonna die without you babe  
No I'm not gonna die
