Go fly a kite and tie your troubles to the tail  
They'll be blown away by a merry gale,  
Go fly a kite and toss your worries to the wind  
And they won't come back, they'll be too chagrined.  
Go on make friends with the sky  
Have a talk with the sun  
It's the bright way to live, if you'll pardon the pun  
Go fly a kite and you'll imagine you're a king  
Cause you've got your world on a piece of string
