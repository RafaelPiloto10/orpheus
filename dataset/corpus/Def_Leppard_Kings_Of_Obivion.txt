Cold nights, dark days  
Love moves in mysterious ways  
It's so sweet like a mother's tongue  
Whose symphony protects her young  
  
But this truth ain't what it seems  
'Cause you and I have different dreams  
You rise up but you never learn  
As we try to shake this sleep that burns  
  
The darkness screams its icy breath  
As daylight dies a thousand deaths  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
  
Reach out to the past  
We blame the victim first and last  
Blind faith got you and me  
Running like a refugee  
We fall out and into the street  
To wash the blood out of the sheets  
And your pain, it flows like wine  
As my subconscious reaps your mind  
  
I stretch to kiss the burning sky  
And watch the waking beauty cry  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
  
Is it such a crime to watch the sunset for the last time  
Until we meet again, goodbye, farewell, amen  
  
Cold nights, dark days  
Love moves in mysterious ways  
We rise up but you'll never learn  
As we try to shake this sleep that burns  
  
The darkness screams its icy breath  
As daylight dies a thousand deaths  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution
