Late at night in summer heat. Expensive car, empty street  
There's a wire in my jacket. This is my trade  
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid  
I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star  
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car  
So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights  
And we drive into the night  
  
Oh the smell of the leather always excited my imagination  
And I picture myself in this different situation  
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife  
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life  
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone  
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne  
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near  
Start ringing in my ear  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its, what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid form the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  
  
I imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool  
She picks the kids up form some private school  
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone  
But there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne  
And the kid's just won't be quiet and she runs a traffic light  
And she drives into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  
  
So here am I in a stolen car at a traffic light  
They go form red to green and so I just drive into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight
