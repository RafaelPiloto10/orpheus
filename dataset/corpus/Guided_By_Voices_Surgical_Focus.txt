With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
?I'm willing to reach out  
Get in to your head?  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
I'm willing to reach out  
Get in to your head  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
Well, I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
...
