Now I know your secret  
I promise that I'll keep it  
So confidentially  
Between just you and me, I'll never leak it  
  
I'm the specialist  
I know you can't resist  
I'll bypass your alarm  
No need to twist my arm, I insist  
  
If you're looking for a war  
There's a market for betrayal  
Don't ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Don't ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said I'd never breathe a word  
Until my dying day  
  
Well seeing is believing  
No use in your deceiving  
For now I know it's true  
It's you that holds the clue, I'll be leaving  
  
Now I've got to say goodbye  
You understand I have to fly  
When you get the third degree  
And the truth don't set you free, You've got to lie  
  
If you're looking for a war  
There's a market for betrayal  
Don't ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Don't ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said I'd never breathe a word  
Until my dying day
