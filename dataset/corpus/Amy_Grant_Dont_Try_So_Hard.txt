Another Monday comes and I just wanna breathe  
'Cause it's a long, long week for someone wired to please  
I keep taking my aim, pushing it higher  
Wanna shine bright, even brighter now  
Wish I would tell myself  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace and you can't earn it  
Don't think that you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Don't try so hard  
  
Do you remember how the summers felt when we were kids?  
Oh, we didn't think much about it, we just lived  
Taking our time, beautiful leisure  
When did we start, trying to measure up  
And all this time, love has been trying to tell us  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace and you can't earn it  
Don't think that you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Don't try so hard  
  
Don't try so hard  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace  
You can't earn it  
Stop thinking you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Lovely the way you are  
So open up your lovely heart  
Don't try so hard
