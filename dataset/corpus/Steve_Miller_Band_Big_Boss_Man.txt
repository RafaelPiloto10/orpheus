Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
You got me workin' boss man  
Workin' 'round the clock  
I want a little drink of water  
But you just won't let me stop  
  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
Now I'm gonna get me a boss man  
One that's gonna treat me right  
Work hard in the day time  
Rest easy at night  
  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all
