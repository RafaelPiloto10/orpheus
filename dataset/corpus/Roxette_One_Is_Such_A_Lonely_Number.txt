I never knew when you walked in the room.  
I sold my soul to a stranger, an angel face yea.  
I never had this kind of sight before,  
This kind of vision white, hang on tight yea.  
I don't know, girl, you've been around.  
Don't you go, don't you let me down.  
  
One is such a lonely number, to make the world go round.  
Three is just a little too much to touch, now honey, to make the world go
round and round and round.  
One is such a lonely number.  
  
I think about what this has done to me.  
I'm going back to the start, back to school days.  
I never had this urge inside of me,  
To hear the sound of a heart fill the airwaves.  
There's a love line, it's tied to the ground.  
Leave you here, never let you down.  
  
One is such a lonely number, to make the world go round.  
Three is just a little too much to touch, now honey, to make the world go
round and round and round.  
One is such a lonely number, to mend a broken heart.  
Three is just a little too much to touch, hey honey, to make the world go
round and round and round and round.  
  
There's a love line, it's tied to the ground. Leave you here, never let you
down.  
One is such a lonely number, to make the world go round.  
Three is just a little too much to touch, now honey, to make the world go
round and round and round.  
One is such a lonely number, to mend a broken heart.  
Three is just a little too much to touch, hey honey, to make the world go
round and round and round.  
  
One is such a lonely number, to make the world go round...
