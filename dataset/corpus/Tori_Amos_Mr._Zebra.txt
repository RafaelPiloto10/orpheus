Hello Mr. Zebra  
Can I have your sweater  
Cause it's cold cold cold  
In my hole hole hole  
Ratatouille strychnine  
Sometimes she's a friend of mine  
With a gigantic whirlpool  
That will blow your mind  
  
Hello Mr. Zebra  
Ran into some confusion  
With a Mrs. Crocodile  
Furry mussels marching on  
She thinks she's Kaiser Wilhelm  
Or a civilized syllabub  
To blow your mind  
  
Figure it out  
She's a goodtime fella  
She's got a little fund to fight  
For Moneypenny's rights  
Figure it out  
She's a goodtime fella  
Too bad the burial was premature  
She said and smiled
