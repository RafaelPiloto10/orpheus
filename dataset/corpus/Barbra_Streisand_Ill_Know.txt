I'll know when my love comes along  
I'll know then and there  
I'll know at the sight of his face  
How I care, how I care, how I care  
And I'll stop, and I'll stare, and I'll know  
Long before we can speak  
I'll know in my heart  
I will know and I won't ever ask  
Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?  
But I but I'll stop and I'll stare  
At that face in the throng  
Yes, I'll know when my love comes along  
That he'll stand before my eyes one day  
I won't need a second glance his way  
I'll know when my love comes along  
I'll know then and there  
I'll know at the sight of his face  
How I care, how I care, how I care  
And I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng  
Yes, I'll know when my love comes along
