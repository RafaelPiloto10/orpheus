I was gonna cancel then I looked into the sky,  
Knew the badness won't prevent the sun to shine  
I was gonna cancel then took a sec to realize  
All the disappointment that would trail behind,  
I was gonna cancel then you reminded me of who I am,  
Everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman  
Just the same as a dog is to man.  
  
(Oh) Just hop out of the bed, (hey)  
Go ahead face the day,  
Who cares what you know,  
Don't let that in the way no way,  
Shut out all the doubt, (hey)  
Just get up and go,  
What's on the other side? (Yeah)  
You will never know unless you,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, go girl.  
  
I was gonna cancel then I thought about the strength  
That I got from all of the prayers and what it meant,  
I was gonna cancel then I realized  
That time is just that money and the love watch how you spend,  
I was gonna cancel until you reminded me of what I do,  
Now I see it clearer, my best friend is a mirror look behind me  
And I see all the things I've been through.  
  
Just hop out of the bed, (hey)  
Go ahead face the day,  
Who cares what you know,  
Don't let that in the way no way,  
Shut out all the doubt,  
Just get up and go,  
What's on the other side?  
You will never know unless you,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, go girl.  
  
What's wrong with saying I love you?  
It's nothing to kid about.  
Some people going through a struggle,  
Trying to scribble it out.  
They say attention is a shovel,  
It's time to dig 'em out.  
You can't just let 'em stay in a bubble,  
They'll pop to get it out.  
  
What's wrong with love, love?  
What's wrong with love, love?  
  
Just hop out of the bed, (hey)  
Go ahead face the day,  
Who cares what you know,  
Don't let that in the way no way,  
Shut out all the doubt, (yeah)  
Just get up and go, (hey)  
What's on the other side?  
You will never know unless you,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, gi-i-irl,  
Go, go, go, go girl.
