Fly into the rising sun,  
Faces, smiling everyone  
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition  
I feel it in my heart  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me  
  
Talk about her like a Queen  
Dancing in a Eastern Dream  
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river  
That carries me away  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me  
  
But I'm at home and I just don't belong  
  
So far away from the garden we love  
She is what moves in the soul of a dove  
Soon I shall see just how black was my night  
When we're alone in Her City of light  
  
Rising from the neon gloom  
Shining like a crazy moon  
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire  
I get high  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me
