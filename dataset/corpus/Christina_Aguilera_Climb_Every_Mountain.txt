Spoken:  
It starts with a dream in your youth  
With a little  
Encouragement,  
Discipline, and determination  
We all have the  
Power  
Inside each of us to reach our goals  
And what we feel is the  
Impossible  
It's all about believing in yourself  
And if you can dream  
It  
You can do it
