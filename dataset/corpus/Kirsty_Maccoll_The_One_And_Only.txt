Sometimes it feels like you will never win  
Just when you're ready to pack it all in  
You tear it down and start over again  
But I'm not down for the first time  
Maybe I'll always be the one and only girl for me  
  
I never minded the rain on my face  
I knew the sun lived in some other place  
I had to go I just needed the space  
But I'm not down for the first time  
Maybe I'll always be the one and only girl for me  
  
Sometimes your life isn't going too well  
Sometimes it reads like a postcard from hell  
I've made my mistakes I suppose you can tell  
Some lives read like a postcard  
And some lives read like a book  
I'll be happy if mine  
Doesn't read like a joke from an old Christmas cracker
