I was walking all alone  
Through a sideshow  
With passion and pain  
On each side  
Something inside me was calling  
For a chance to stay alive  
  
At the time I didn't know  
What was calling  
As my head was buried in grief  
Today I heard what was crying  
My freedom calling me  
  
And we all make our choices  
Like a blind man feels his way  
And the choice  
I've made is simple  
Passion over pain  
  
When I got to  
The end of the sideshow  
And looked back  
To where I had been  
My eyes filled with  
Teardrops of loneliness  
For the ones  
Who will never be fee  
  
I thought of  
The children in the sideshow  
As they wandered  
Around so confused  
Some day  
They'll make their decision  
But which one will they choose  
  
And we'll all make our choices  
Like a blind man feels his way  
And the choice  
I've made is simple  
Passion over pain  
  
And we'll all make our choices  
Like a blind man feels his way  
And the choice  
I've made is simple  
Passion, passion over pain  
  
And we'll all make our choices  
Like a blind man feels his way  
And the choice  
I've made is a simple one  
Passion over pain
