I remember the night so well.  
The rain was fallin' but I just couldn't tell,  
If it was you that was callin' to my love-sick brain.  
But the rain kept fallin' on my window pane.  
  
Out of the night the thunder rang in my ear.  
I can't fight the feelin', Lord, that brings forth my fears.  
I wish it was over, Lord, please stop the rain.  
The rain that's fallin' on my window pane.  
  
The rain that's fallin' on my window pane.  
Every night the rain's on time, I can feel it in this heart of mine.  
But I don't know what to do.  
Well, I guess I could go back home, 'cause you know back home is where I
belong.  
But it just ain't home without you.  
  
And I don't know what to do, baby.  
Well, I guess I'm a looser but it just don't seem fair.  
I lost all my life so tell me, why should I care?  
The night that you left me is the night that it came.  
And the rain's still fallin' on my window pane.  
  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
I said the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
I said the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
Keeps right on fallin'.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
  
I said, the rain keeps fallin'
