It's been a long day, Tell me how you've been  
Sorry it's so late, But here we go again  
We're sitting here together  
Your hand in mine I could stay here forever  
Given more time  
  
Given more time to laugh and dance  
Give more time to have the chance  
To show you this where, I want to be  
But that old clock up on the wall  
It don't even care at all  
Lord I wish I was given more time  
For you and me  
  
Honey how was your day  
Did you spend it on the run  
I know the kids are okay  
Thanks for getting things done  
In a few more hours, The sun's gonna shine  
I wish I had the power, To be given more time
