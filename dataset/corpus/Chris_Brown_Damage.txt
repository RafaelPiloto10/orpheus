(Damage)  
You know  
Sometimes you don't realize what you've done  
Until you've seen the damage  
And now I look at the damage  
(Look at the damage)  
  
Three A.M. when my phone ring, begging me to come by  
I was right around the corner  
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop  
Told me to Come in, the door is unlock for ya  
My intuition  
I should  
Have listened to it  
My girl  
Yo, she'd be pissed if she knew  
About this visit  
She had her tank top on, I took her tank top off  
I should've stopped  
Stop!  
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently  
She tempt me  
Right then I stopped thinking consequences  
Guess I must've lost my mind for a minute  
  
[Chorus]  
There's no better love  
Girl, I love you  
With her that was lust  
Yeah  
Shouldn't have been  
I know I messed up  
Yeah  
One phone call  
Started this whole thing  
Now look at the damage (the damage)  
Look at the damage (the damage)  
The damage  
Damage that I've caused you (that I've caused you)  
I know I broke your heart  
Cause I did you wrong  
Now look at the damage  
Look at the damage that I've caused  
  
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of  
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love  
I gotta live with regret  
Deserve to get what you get  
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying  
I rode past your house for hours  
Just to feel close to ya  
No car, no gift, no flowers  
Could get me back with you  
Your kiss, your touch  
Girl, you know I miss it  
But you got my heart  
Inside of a prison  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was trippin'  
I was dippin'  
With these women  
In these streets  
Lost my girl  
Lost all that  
Wish I could  
Take it back  
  
I was trippin'  
I was dippin'  
With these women  
In these streets  
Wish I could  
Take that back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at the damage  
Look at the damage  
  
You know  
Sometimes you don't realize what you've done  
Until you've seen the damage  
And now I look at the damage
