They say always use a condom, I say always use a whip  
They say be careful where you come at night, I just shoot straight from the
hip  
When it comes to loves great fountain, I won't just take a sip  
I'll swallow and I'll gulp until the fountain makes me sick  
  
So it's me left with the baby and disease  
You can't say you didn't want it on your hands and on your knees  
You made me feel so special  
Well you were especially good  
I'm sorry that you misunderstood  
  
These neatly folded corduroys hide rubber underneath  
But the only rubber you have worn is that useless rubber sheath  
I won't have what I've got for you stolen by no thief  
'Cause the safest sex I've ever had was hanging from a tree  
  
So you've left me for another pretty face  
That's not true I left you for one half the human race  
Now I'm by myself  
A woman who knows her place  
It's not so much the chase, it's the race  
  
They say treat her like a lady and she'll treat you like her jewels  
They say cruel to be kind, I just say cruel to be cruel  
They say only marry once, I say only marry fools  
They wouldn't have made the cane if you weren't meant to break the rules  
  
Have you told them that you'll hurt them then be gone?  
I've told them that I'll hurt them if that really turns them on  
You left a bitter scar  
I tied those ropes too tight!  
I'll tie them loose for you tonight  
  
When I told you that I loved you  
I meant mini-correct  
When I said I'd never leave you  
I meant mini-correct  
A ring around your finger, a chain around your neck  
That was major correct
