I know what you've been waiting for  
A little love and happiness  
The truth in front of you, so hard to ignore  
All you need is tenderness  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I ain't no James Dean  
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe  
We can make it babe, if we just let it go  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing  
You're thinking, maybe I'm just breaking the rules  
By coming on a little strong  
But I got information you can use  
Do lighten up and play along  
Let's have a wing ding, a little spring thing  
Don't tell me no  
I don't want no wedding ring, ain't rushing anything  
Just let the good times roll  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I ain't no James Dean  
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe  
We can make it babe, if we just let it go  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing
