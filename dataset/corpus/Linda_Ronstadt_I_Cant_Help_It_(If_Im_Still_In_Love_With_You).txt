Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart fell at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And she looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
A picture from the past came slowly stealing  
As I brushed your arm and stood so close to you  
Suddenly I got that old time feeling  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
It's hard to know another's lips have kissed you  
And held you just the way I used to do  
Heaven only knows how much I've missed you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
