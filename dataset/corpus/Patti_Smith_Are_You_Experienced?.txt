If you can just get your mind together  
Then come across to me  
We'll hold hands an' then we'll watch the sun rise  
From the bottom of the sea  
But first  
  
Are You Experienced?  
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
I know, I know  
You'll probably scream n' cry  
That your little world won't let go  
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove that  
You're made out of gold and -a can't be sold  
  
So-er, Are You Experienced?  
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
Ah, let me prove it to you  
I think they're calling our names  
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will  
If you just take hold of my hand  
  
Ah! But Are You Experienced?  
Have you ever been experienced?
