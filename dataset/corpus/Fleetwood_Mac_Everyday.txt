Don't keep me hanging on a string  
Tell me what I feel is no big thing  
Don't turn away I'm listening  
Over and over again  
  
Don't give me visions to explain  
There are no doubts I feel the strain  
Of all my senses yearning  
Over and over again  
  
Every day I see you  
Every day I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on again  
Again  
  
It's not important to wonder why  
What is just is  
No more to imply  
This simple thought repeating  
Over and over again  
  
Everyday I see you  
Everyday I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on again  
  
Imagine all the ways to cope  
I close my eyes, that gives me hope  
It cures the silence  
  
Everyday I see you  
Everyday I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on  
  
Everyday I see you  
I see you  
Everyday I need you  
I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on again  
Again
