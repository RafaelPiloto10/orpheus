They used to call me names  
Said I was just a wanna be  
But now they all pay to see  
What they were gettin for free  
  
How about them days and now  
You don't know what to say  
Ain't it funny how the sun can shine  
And hide away  
  
And its a long way on a they say highway  
I'm still runnin  
A lonesome freeway of uncut my way  
Can you feel me comin  
I'm tombstone ugly and if you judge me  
Bettah wathc for me comin  
In a 59 drop top blood red cadillac  
  
Knock knockin  
Black bob at your door  
Still rockin  
Everybody say that  
Knock knockin  
Lookin for the payback  
  
They used to say ritchie boy  
He got no sense  
But now they say oh bobby man  
He was my best friend  
  
Ain't it funny how the glory and the stories  
And the times can change  
And no sense ritchie just  
Bought himself a big fuckin airplane  
  
And its a long way on a they say highway  
I'm still runnin  
A lonesome freeway of uncut my way  
Can you feel me comin  
I'm tombstone ugly and if you judge me  
Bettah wathc for me comin  
In a 59 drop top blood red cadillac  
  
Knock knockin  
Black bob at your door  
Still rockin  
Everybody say that  
Knock knockin  
Lookin for the payback  
  
I grew up in the back woods  
Hung in the crack hoods  
Learned to pimp  
Like a mack should  
  
I could have been a rich man like pops  
I never kissed ass  
And those days since passed  
Here I stand like jesus  
  
I don't need this  
Fuck you ho's can squeeze this  
I can't believe this  
I'm so wasted  
  
From all the fruits of life  
That I've tasted  
Never a clone on the microphone  
I got shit built up  
  
'Cause I never felt loved at home  
And all alones how I spend my free time  
Writin' freal rhymes  
Drinkin' cheap wine  
  
Easy whips  
And a cracker  
I'm the master blaster  
No one cuts faster  
  
The king of disaster  
Is who I am ho  
And I'll be rippin the fuckin ryhmes  
And ill make you mother shit her pants bro  
  
So so  
You better watch your back  
Watch for me comin'  
Watch for me comin'  
In a 59 drop top blood red cadillac
