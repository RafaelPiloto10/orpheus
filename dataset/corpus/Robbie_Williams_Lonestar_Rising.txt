Bah-um, bah-um, bah-um, bah-um, bah-um  
Sun is shining, so why am I feeling the cold?  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Not surprising, something has fallen from the fold  
  
Bah-um, bah-um, bah-um  
Lonestar rising, God only knows where I'll go  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Ohh, what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um  
  
Every others passed to remind of the time  
All the lovers living in limbo divine  
Bah-um, bah-um,bah-um  
Every reason has every reason to go  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
All the seasons melt into one like the snow  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um  
No sensation, not even tears rolling down  
Bah-um  
Conversation, echoes like ghosts on the town  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Lonestar rising, God only knows where I'll go  
Bah-um  
Ohh, what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um
