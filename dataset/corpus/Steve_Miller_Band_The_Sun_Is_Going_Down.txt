Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
Sittin' in a bar in San Francisco  
Got no place to go  
Sun is going down, man  
Sun is going down  
Sittin' in the bar out at the airport  
Tryin' to flag a plane  
Plane she won't fly  
Plane she won't fly  
I've been travellin' such a long, long time  
Out here on this road  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Tryin' to get back home  
Livin' a lonely life, tryin' to get back home  
Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Out here on this road  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Tryin' to find a home  
Tryin' to find a home  
Sun is going down  
Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do
