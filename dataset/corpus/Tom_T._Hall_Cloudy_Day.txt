I never did like that apartment it was not a place I like to be  
In summertime the place was hot in wintertime I'd sit around and freeze  
I never did like that apartment seems to me it always smell like food  
People down the hall complained because I liked to pick and sing  
And anyway the rent was overdue  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day  
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them  
This looks like a cloudy day for me  
I've forgot the number of the Interstate that brought me to this town  
I've been here for seven months and still I do not know my way around  
Well I'd like to find a quiet place and trouble is I don't know where it's at  
I don't know which way is best but I think I'll be headin' west  
So I'll be walkin' where the land is flat  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day...  
I've know people higher up the ladder who can always pick and choose  
Anything they want to be or anyplace they go to just can't lose  
It doesn't matter who you are we all must have a cloudy day some time  
Days that we can't seem to win days that we ain't got a friend  
We all have days and I guess this is mine  
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day...  
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them  
This looks like a cloudy day for me
