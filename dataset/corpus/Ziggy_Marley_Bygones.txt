Naah laugh it off  
Can't laugh it off  
Naah laugh it off  
We can't let bygones be bygones anymore  
For this time we naah laugh it off  
Tell we when you're ready and we'll come settle the score  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge  
I'm saying though  
Only a fool lean up on his folly  
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness  
I'm saying though never get a righteous man vex  
Oh, we've let bygones be bygones before  
But this time we naah laugh it off  
We won't let bygones be bygones anymore  
For this time we naah laugh at all  
This time we naah laugh it off  
[Incomprehensible]  
We can't let bygones be bygones anymore  
Oh, this time we naah laugh it off  
Oh, we've let bygones be bygones before  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge  
I tell you this, only the fool lean up on the folly  
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness  
I tell you this never get a righteous man vex  
We've let bygones be bygones before  
This time we naah laugh it off  
We can't let bygones be bygones anymore  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
Say this time me naah laugh it off  
[Incomprehensible]
