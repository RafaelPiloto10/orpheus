I whispered you  
Words I thought I'd never say  
We played the game  
But then we tossed the rules away  
Could deny it  
Justify it  
But we both know we went too far  
Oh, I can feel you  
And I need you  
No matter wherever you are  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to watch my love come crashing down  
But I can't lie to my heart  
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round  
But baby I just can't lie to my heart  
  
I have loved you  
Longer than you've even known  
When you hurt I hurt  
I'm your flesh and you're my bone  
If I could only  
Be two people  
Darlin' I swear we'd both be with you  
Oh, I know I'm selfish  
But I'm helpless  
I want you and nothing else will do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't pretend anymore  
Been hiding too long  
I won't go on like before  
I'm not that strong  
I can feel it when I'm near you  
It's not healthy to need you this way  
Try to fight it, get inside it  
But this pain is stronger than me and it won't go away  
  
[Chorus]
