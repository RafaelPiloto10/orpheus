Dear hero imprisoned  
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting  
Oh, I can't help quoting you  
Because everything that you said rings true  
And now in my cell  
(well, I followed you)  
And here's a list of who I slew  
  
Reggie Kray - do you know my name?  
Oh, don't say you don't  
Please say you do, (oh) I am :  
  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
  
And in my cell  
(well, I loved you)  
And every man with a job to do  
Ronnie Kray - do you know my face?  
Oh, don't say you don't  
Please say you do, (oh) I am :  
  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
  
In our lifetime those who kill  
The news world hands them stardom  
And these are the ways  
On which I was raised  
These are the ways  
On which I was raised  
  
I never wanted to kill  
I am not naturally evil  
Such things I do  
Just to make myself  
More attractive to you  
Have I failed?  
  
Oh...  
  
Oh, the last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous
