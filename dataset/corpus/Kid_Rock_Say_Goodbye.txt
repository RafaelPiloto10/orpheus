[Verse 1]  
We haven't really talked about it  
All we do is walk around it now  
I hate to say I thought about it  
I wished that we could make this work somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not really complicated  
I can hear it when you sigh  
It comes a time we have to face it  
Maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lately I can feel us drifting  
Even tho the good outweighs the bad  
It feels like our world is shifting  
And yet, you are the best I've ever had  
  
[Chorus]  
I still love to watch you sleeping  
I still see that look in your eyes  
But they're seein' and believin'  
That maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Bridge]  
Say goodbye to all the times we treasured  
Say goodbye, let the chips fall where they lay  
Say goodbye, to things we cannot measure  
Walk away, say goodbye!  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'll remember you forever  
I'll remember every single year  
Runnin' through the rain and laughin'  
And later in our bed we feel so near  
And I'll know when I am older  
And the clouds fill up the sky  
I may look over my shoulder  
And no-one was too young to say goodbye  
Years from now when I am older  
I may sit and wonder why  
Will I look over my shoulder?  
And know I was too young to say goodbye  
I was just too young to say goodbye  
To say goodbye!
