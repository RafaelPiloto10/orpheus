[Chorus]  
Well I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
You said it's finally over, here's the reasons why  
You said you've heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
  
I thought I made you happy but you've proved me wrong  
I thought I was the one that really turned you on  
When I came home tonight all my things were gone  
I guess gettin' over me didn't take you long  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well, you said you'd heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
No I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye
