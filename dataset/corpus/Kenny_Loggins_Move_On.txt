Better not lie before it's too late, I wanna know why  
I wanna know, I wanna know why you keep making me wait  
I guess a girl can't understand what it is that a woman will give a man  
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on  
  
You know I'm getting uptight with your forgetting ways  
But girl, it ain't right, it ain't right, I guess it must be a phase  
When a girl can't understand what it is that a woman gives a man  
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on  
  
You got no re, no reason for thinking that you're gonna do wrong  
So stop your reason, give up or you better be gone, move on  
  
You got no reason for thinking that you're gonna do wrong  
So stop your reason, give up, move on  
  
If you wanna say bye then it's all just the same  
I don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't, if it's only a game  
I guess a girl can't understand what it is that a woman, she gives a man  
And if you're not gonna love it, oh, you better move on  
I think you better move on, better move on
