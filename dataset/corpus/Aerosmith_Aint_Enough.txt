Riding a hurricane, tied to a ball and chain  
Too much of a good good thing, it kind of stops you in your tracks  
How did you ever get this far, now honey don't look back  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Heh, inside of you, yeah  
  
Ride on a carpet ride, high on the tears you cried  
One's just too many but a thousands not enough  
And you can't make up your mind playing blind mans bluff  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Yeah, inside of you  
  
It ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, I got to have it now ain't it tough  
It ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough  
Oh shit  
  
You know another touch is easy, try and reach the sky  
And though you can't get much more higher than you ever tried  
When you die you're not forsaken  
Best be taking tries of all the things that you're not taking  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it ain't it tough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it
