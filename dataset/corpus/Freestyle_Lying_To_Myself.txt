I, believed in you  
Why'D you leave when you  
Said that you'D never let me go  
All I gave was love  
Wasn'T that enough  
Tell me the truth, I need to know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself, that I don'T need you beside me  
That I'Ve finally put it all behind me... but  
Chorus  
I'D only be lying to myself  
And I'D only be dreaming of what,  
I know would not come true  
Coz no matter what I do  
To try to think I'M doing well  
Reality is that I'M still not over you  
I, go, everyday  
Trying to find my way  
Drifting into the empty roads  
Cryin' every night  
These tears, so hard to fight  
What do I do, I just don'T know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself that I never needed you, anyway  
And after all, I'Ve nothing more to say...  
(Repeat chorus)  
Bridge  
I thought that it was never ending  
I thought that we were not pretending it was real  
I know my heart will soon be mending  
And after the rain, the sun will soon reveal...  
That I  
Chorus ii  
I have been lying to myself  
And I, I have been dreaming of what  
I thought would not come true  
I know after what I'M going through  
I will be doing well  
And when the day comes,  
I know what I'Ll say is true  
That reality is... I'M finally over you
