The moon goes up, I start to sweat call the doctor, call the vet my brain goes
numb, my blood gets hot all I need is what you got  
  
I'm a werewolf, baby, and here I come I'm a werewolf, baby, and here I come  
  
I lose control, I just can't stop you look so good like a big pork chop ripped
my pants, ripped my shirt I'm gonna eat your  
Mother for dessert  
  
I can smell your blood, I can hear you breathe I'm gonna eat your heart, right
off your sleeve eat you cooked, eat you raw I'm  
Gonna rip you up like a big chain saw
