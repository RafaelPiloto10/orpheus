Hear that lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly.  
The midnight train is whining low.  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by.  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide it's face and cry.  
  
Did you ever see a Robin weep  
When leaves begin to die,  
That means he's lost the will to live.  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky.  
And as I wonder just where you are  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.
