Thought that I was strong  
I know the words I need to say  
Frozen in my place  
I let the moment slip away  
  
I've been screaming on the inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me, but it's not enough  
  
Never meant to lie  
But I'm not the girl you think you know  
The more that I am with you  
The more that I am all alone  
  
I've been screaming on the inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me, but it's not enough  
  
Not that I so different  
Not that I don't see  
The dying light of what we used to be  
But how could I forgive you?  
You've changed  
And I'm a liar by your side  
I'm about to lose my mind  
  
'Cause I've been screaming looking inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
You've been dreaming  
If you're thinking  
That I still belong to you  
I've been dying,  
'Cause I'm lying to myself  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me but it's not enough
