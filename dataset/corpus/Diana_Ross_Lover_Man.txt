I don't know why  
But I'm feeling so sad  
I long to try  
Something I never had  
Never had no kissing  
Ooh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
The night is cold  
And I'm so all alone  
I'll give my soul  
Just to call you my own  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
I've heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
I've heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
