Intersecting love lines  
Drew us closer every day  
Always kept your distance  
When you felt my presence near you  
Love keeps on rolling over  
  
Fly in retreat  
I would follow without shame  
A stupid spud staggering to the flame  
To be had and re-had  
Be a victim of the pain  
Now it's strange, it's so strange  
It's a strange pursuit  
It's a strange pursuit  
It's a strange pursuit  
  
I come running like a fat-boy  
In lead shoes  
But like a fat-boy  
Huff puffing after you  
It's hopeless to hope for  
The one thing that I'm wanting  
'Cause it's strange  
It's so very strange  
  
It's a strange pursuit  
Darling, I'm dazzled  
But you know I'm too Frazzled  
It's a strange pursuit  
Makin' my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
It's a strange pursuit  
  
You know it's getting tough  
When you're getting real rough  
It's a strange pursuit  
Darling, I'm dazzled  
But you know I'm too frazzled  
It's a strange pursuit  
Makin' my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
It s a strange pursuit
