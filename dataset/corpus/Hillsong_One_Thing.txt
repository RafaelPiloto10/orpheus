One thing I desire  
One thing I seek  
To gaze upon Your beauty  
And Your majesty  
God of my salvation  
Lifter of my head  
Teach me how to live oh Lord  
In Your righteousness  
  
So I pray to You  
So I pray to You  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord Your name  
Is higher than the heavens  
Lord Your name  
Is higher than all created things  
Higher than hope  
Higher than dreams  
The name of the Lord  
  
In the day of trouble  
You cover me  
In the secret place of refuge  
Lord I will sing  
  
So I pray to You  
So I pray to You  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will seek Your face  
Call upon Your name Jesus  
All I want is You  
Jesus [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus: x 2]
