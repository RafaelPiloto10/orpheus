Crazy but I believe this time  
Begging for sweet relief  
A blessing in disguise  
Dying behind these tired eyes  
I've been losing sleep  
Please come to me tonight  
  
Hands on a miracle  
I've got my hands on a miracle  
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle  
And there ain't no way  
That you'd it away  
  
Everything that we survived  
It's gonna be alright  
Just lucky we're alive  
Got no vision I've been blind  
Searching every where  
You're right here in my sight
