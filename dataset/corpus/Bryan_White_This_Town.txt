This town doesn't understand  
Two people makin' dreams and plans  
They say we're much too young  
In this town  
  
This town's full of narrow minds  
Can't see beyond the city limit signs  
They close the bedroom blinds  
In this town  
  
I've done some thinkin'  
And I realize  
There's more than Dairy Queens and Friday Nights  
While we're still young we've gotta get away  
Together we can make our break  
  
From this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
Now this town's got a factory  
Not much future here for you and me  
It's as far as they can see  
In this town  
  
I've heard the blowin' at my door  
Voices tellin' me there's so much more  
It's easy to get bored  
In this town  
  
I've just go to see those city lights  
It's time we spread our wings and learn to fly  
They'll never catch us if we disappear  
Oh the interstate is much too near  
  
To this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
Can't you just hear them talkin'  
Their righteous words  
Burnin' down the wire  
What do we care what they think now  
Thinkin's not allowed  
In this town  
  
From this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
This town  
This town  
This town
