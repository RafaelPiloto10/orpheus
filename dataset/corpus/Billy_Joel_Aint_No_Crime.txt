You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'  
And you gotta get ready to go  
You say you went out late last evenin'  
Did a lot of drinkin'  
Come home stinkin'  
And you went and fell asleep on the floor  
And then your lady comes and finds you asleepin'  
Starts in to weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'  
And you better get your ass out the door  
  
Ain't no crime  
Say everybody gets that way some time  
Ain't no crime  
You know it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind  
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh.  
  
You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine o'clock comin' with out any warnin'  
And you gotta get ready to go  
Well now you tell me you love somebody  
And you'll love 'em forever  
You may love 'em forever  
But you won't like 'em all of the time  
Well now you tell me you need somebody for the rest of your life  
You might have somebody  
But you won't want 'em everyday  
  
Ain't no crime  
Say ev'rybody gets that way some time  
Ain't no crime  
Well it's just human nature  
Happens all the time  
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh  
  
And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'  
The grass keeps growin'  
You gotta keep goin'  
And the Lord have mercy on your soul  
La, la la la.
