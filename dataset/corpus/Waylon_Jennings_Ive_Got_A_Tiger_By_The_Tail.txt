I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
Well, every night you drag me where the bright lights are found  
There ain't no way to slowin' you down  
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I thought the day I met you you were meek as a lamb  
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans  
Now the pace we've been living takes the wind from my sails  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
