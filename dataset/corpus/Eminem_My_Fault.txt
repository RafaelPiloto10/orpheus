[Chorus: x2]  
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl  
I never meant to bring you to my world  
Now you sitting in the corner crying  
And now its my fault (My fault)  
  
I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave  
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved  
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up  
With first aid tape and raped on the first date  
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using  
She loved booze and alternative music  
Told me she was going back to using again  
I said wait first try this hallucinogen  
Its better then heroin and booze and gin  
Come here lets go in here  
Who's in the den? (Its me and Kelly)  
My bad lets try another room (I don't trust you)  
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom  
This will help you get in touch with your roots  
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods  
(Oh hell I might as well try them this party is so drag)  
Oh dag I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag (Uh)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yo Sue (Get away from me I don't know you)  
Oh shoot she's tripping (I need to go puke)  
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major  
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature  
Susie stop crying I don't hate ya  
The world is not against you  
I am sorry your father raped you  
So you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth  
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out  
She said (Help me I think I am having a seizure)  
I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my t-shirt (Let go)  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me  
She said (I am 26 years old and I am not married I don't even have any  
Kids and I can't cook)  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Susie where you going you better be careful  
(leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled)  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum?  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please?  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John where's Dave at before I bash you  
He's in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And there's only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off?  
Well it depends on how may you've had  
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps  
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol (She is going to die dude)  
I know and its my fault (My god)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I am so sorry I am so sorry  
Susie please wake up  
What are you doing  
Your not dead
