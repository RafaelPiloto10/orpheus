I wanna jump, but I'm afraid I'll fall. I wanna holler, but the joint's too
small.  
Young Man Rhythym got a hold on me too,  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu.  
I wanna get in trouble, but that ain't all.  
I wanna kiss her, but the gal's too tall.  
I wanna scream, but that ain't all. I wanna kiss her, but the gal's too small.  
I wanna scream, but no one's around. My baby's loving, Lord, she's carrying on
