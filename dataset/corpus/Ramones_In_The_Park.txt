All dressed up an' the sun sets low  
When the big bright moon  
Shines a friendly hello  
When my heart pants  
With lust like a Romeo  
Like I am messed up  
When the fireflies glow  
  
I just want to cuss and fight  
I goin' out tonight  
Everything is out of sight  
It's gonna be all right  
  
I am gonna hang out in the park  
Hang out after dark  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
  
Under street lamps I will play  
After the school day  
When troubles disappear  
I feel excitement is here  
  
Kids in cars were cruisin' by  
The big bright moon  
Smiles in the sky  
Music playin' that portable sound  
Everybody's hangin' all around  
  
I am gonna hang out in the park  
Hang out after dark  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight
