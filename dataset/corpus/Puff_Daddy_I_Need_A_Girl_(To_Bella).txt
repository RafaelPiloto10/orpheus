[Chorus]  
I need a girl who'll ride for me (Keep her self real fly)  
Damn near die for me (Stand by my side)  
Gon' call for me (Stand up and cry)  
Pay my bail for me, make sales for me  
Have a baby with (This is what she'll do)  
Lie to industry (Be my baby momma too)  
Someone who'll never leave (And always be true)  
How I wish my wife could be you  
  
[Loon]  
I need a girl that'll ride for me  
Situation get real bitch'll die for me  
Even step in the courtroom and lie for me  
I'm talkin' about right hand in the sky for me  
  
Do twenty-five for me, nigga steal a pound for me  
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me  
And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me  
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me  
  
Never say bye to me  
I can't deny shorty love is official  
Even though love ain't the issue  
Shorty still smuggle the pistol  
  
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you  
Show you love when other niggas that diss you  
You on the real  
That's the type chick a nigga need  
  
The type smoke all a nigga's weed  
And still move at a nigga's speed  
Never a victim of a nigga's greed  
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
I had a girl that woulda died for me  
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me  
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me  
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)  
  
At first we were friends then became lovers  
You was more than my girl we was like brothers  
On late nights we would play fight under covers  
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to  
  
But every time I think about your pretty smile  
And we used to drive the whole city wild  
Damn I wish you woulda had my child  
A pretty little girl with Diddy style  
  
Shit is wild  
Now these's days that I reminisce  
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)  
But long as you happy I'ma tell you this  
  
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix  
Mamacita  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Loon]  
Now I done seen chicks come and go  
Some in it for the love some want the dough  
But some of them confused and don't really know  
The difference between a woman and a silly ho  
  
But on the low  
I'm a tell you how it really be  
'Cause I be chillin' where the young willies be  
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's  
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be  
  
[P. Diddy]  
This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis  
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body  
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale  
(But I'm ride for you Daddy) Then I got you mami  
  
'Cause all I want to do is take care of you  
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do  
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too  
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you  
  
You feel me girl?  
  
[Chorus]
