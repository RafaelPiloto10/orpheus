I believed in fairy tales  
In magic spells and wishing wells  
And pirate sails  
And once I thought I'd never fall in love  
That shows how much I knew  
I believed in Superman  
In Santa Claus, the world of Oz  
And wonderland  
But one by one those fantasies have failed  
While you keep shining through  
I still believe in you  
  
I could never doubt your kiss  
No other love  
Fills me like this  
If you take a chance, you'll see  
I believe in you  
Believe in me  
  
Other dreams may turn to dust  
But I don't care  
If you'll be there  
I'll always trust  
'Cause I believe with all my heart and soul  
This dream we share is true  
I still believe in you
