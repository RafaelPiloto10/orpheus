She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born  
She should have worn the crown of thorns  
  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have made her mother proud  
She should have stood out in the crowd  
She should have fallen on her stance  
She should have had another chance  
  
[Repeat x2]  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born  
She should have worn the crown of thorns  
  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son
