I believe in you and me  
I'm coming to find you  
If it takes me all night  
Wrong until you make it right  
And I won't forget you  
At least I'll try  
And run, and run tonight  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
  
I wasn't shopping for a doll  
To say the least, I thought, I've seen them all  
But then you took me by surprise  
I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew, I never knew  
So take your suitcase, cause I don't mind  
And baby doll, I meant it every time  
You don't need to compromise  
I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew, I never knew  
But it's alright  
  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright
