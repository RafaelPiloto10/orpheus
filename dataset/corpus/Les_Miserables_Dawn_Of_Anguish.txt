[Day breaks.]  
  
Enjolras  
The people have not stirred  
We are abandoned by those who still live in fear.  
The people have not heard.  
Yet will will not abandon those who cannot hear.  
Let us not waste lives  
Let all the women and fathers of children  
Go from here.  
  
Feuilly  
Drink with me to days gone by  
Sing with me the songs we knew  
  
All  
At the shrine of friendship  
Raise your glass high  
Let the wine of friendship  
Never run dry  
If I die  
I die with you!  
  
So never kick a dog  
Because he's just a pup  
We'll fight like twenty armies  
And we won't give up  
So you'd better run for cover  
When the pup grows......  
  
[He dies.]
