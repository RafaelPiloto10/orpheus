Inside a song, there's a hero to discover  
There's no way we can try off without struggle  
I'm just like you  
Are you trying to bring me down  
I'm just like you  
Help me turn this thing around  
I dream at night  
Off of better day  
You and I, in a better place  
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it  
Don't know when but I know that we're leaving  
  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
Lift me up  
To higher ground  
Not too proud to say I need you know  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
We are meant to be here for one another  
Don't forget you're my sister you're my brother  
I'm just like you I got troubles on my own  
Just like you I am trying to make it home  
I dream at night of a better day  
You and I, in a better place  
  
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it  
Don't know when but I know that we're leaving  
  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
Lift me up  
To higher ground  
Not too proud to say I need you know  
Lift me up  
Don't hold me down  
I don't wanna be down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Inside a song, there's a hero to discover  
There's no way we can try off without struggle  
I'm just like you  
Are you trying to bring me down  
  
I'm just like you  
Help me turn this thing around
