I want to feel my earth turn over, baby  
In this hardened winter ground  
Feel my earth turn over, darlin'  
Until' I'm rootless and unbound  
I want to feel my body tremble  
When there's no one else around  
Just this cool, clear water runnin'  
In this love that I've found  
Hey, baby  
See how it can be  
Every time you reveal yourself to me  
I'll come runnin'  
I want to feel myself go under, baby  
Where the deepest river bleeds  
I want to feel it pull me under, darlin'  
Until it drops me to my knees  
I want to know that I could find you  
When there's no more eyes to see  
In this cool, clear water runnin'  
You'll come runnin' to me  
Hey, baby  
All my life I have known there's something more  
Love to blind me like the sun  
Deep in dreams, I will wash upon your shore  
Now I know that you're the one  
And when I feel my baby callin'  
It's like a whisper in a sand  
When the softest rain is fallin', darlin'  
I will crumble in your hand  
And when all that's left is wonder  
And no need to understand  
Well, this cool, clear water runnin'  
Will be all that I am  
Hey, baby  
Will be all that I am  
All that I am
