I know you're thinking that I'm playing  
But I'm saying that I wouldn't hurt you for the world, oh no  
I'm not so blind, Baby  
I need your lovin' and you know it (yes, I do, well) 'cause I'll show it, well  
I don't want to be hurt you  
  
If you want me to I'll keep it a secret  
But please let me get through your door  
'Cause I guarantee that once we get started  
You'll soon be begging for more  
We want the whole world to know that we are one  
So why don't you gimme some time, Baby  
Let's take advantage not for granted for the good things  
(We got for the good things)  
I don't want to be hurt you  
You just be kind, Baby  
  
We've got a good thing and I know it, let's not blow it, oh  
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious  
I believe you think that I haven't noticed  
The look in your eyes when you smile  
And my senses tell me there's something missing  
So please let me stay for a little while  
I want the whole world to know that we are one  
We got it together, Baby, we're one  
So why don't you gimme some time, Baby  
I know you're thinking that I'm playing  
But all I'm saying  
  
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious  
Gimme some time, Baby, gimme some time, Baby  
I, I know, you know, I know you love me  
And I thank that you thank that we should be together  
So why, why, why don't you gimme some of your time  
Hey, that's all I need, that's all I want  
Gimme just a little hour, just some more time  
Yeah, you better gimme some time  
Oh, you better gimme some time
