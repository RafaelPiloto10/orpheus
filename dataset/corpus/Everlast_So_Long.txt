So Long  
From "End of Days" soundtrack  
  
D'you ever had bad dreams?  
All I have is bad dreams  
I knew a man with a son  
He bought him a gun  
And learned Shorty just how to use it  
Taught him huntin' and skinnin'  
Right from the beginnin'  
Built himself a mighty fine killa  
Killa  
But Shorty got picked on  
Beat on and kicked on  
Now all his classmates want to punk him  
So the tears in his eye may catch him in the rye  
Told his old man he went huntin'  
Never felt so free  
Like his destiny  
Their was someone out on the horizon  
His heart went cold, he felt a hundred years old  
Started pullin' back on the trigga  
  
I think I'm gonna die today  
Today, today, today  
Everyone who hurt me's gonna pay  
Pay, pay, pay  
How can such a short time feel so long?  
Long, long, long  
How can such a young life go so wrong?  
Wrong, wrong, wrong  
Go so wrong  
  
What'll it gonna take  
For you to really make it in life?  
  
See me (x2)  
Hear me (x2)  
But don't touch me  
You should fear me  
(Fear me)  
Hold your life dearly  
Cause I'm seriously disturbed  
That's my word  
(My word)  
Straight to my mother  
Wade, my brother  
(Brother)  
Found another  
One to play sucker  
Cause I ain't the one  
Who has shaded your son  
And took all your shine  
Watch me get mine  
And feel my love burn  
(Burn)  
Pay for my sins  
Watch me grow turns  
Psycho begins  
(Psycho)  
Losses he wins  
Angels in heels  
Dancin' on top  
Of Heaven, pimp  
Don't know where I'm goin'  
But I know where I've been  
You can't hear a sound  
Clappin' for a pound  
I came to get down  
I came to get dirty  
I came to get even  
Even, even, even  
  
(x3) I think I'm gonna die today  
Today, today, today  
Everyone who hurt me's gonna pay  
Pay, pay, pay  
How can such a short time feel so long?  
Long, long, long  
How can such a young life go so wrong?  
Wrong, wrong, wrong (x3)  
  
Momma don't cry  
Please, momma don't cry  
Momma don't cry, you did nothing wrong
