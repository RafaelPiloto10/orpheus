Where do I take this pain of mine  
I run, but it stays right my side  
  
So tear me open, pour me out  
There's things inside that scream and shout  
And the pain still hates me  
So hold me, until it sleeps  
  
Just like the curse, just like the stray  
You feed it once, and now it stays  
  
So tear me open, but beware  
There's things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me, until I'm clean  
  
It grips you, so hold me  
It stains you, so hold me  
It hates you, so hold me  
It holds you, so hold me  
  
Until it sleeps  
  
So tell me why you've chosen me  
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed  
  
I'll tear me open, make you gone  
No more can you hurt anyone  
And the fear still shakes me  
So hold me, until it sleeps  
  
It grips you, so hold me  
It stains you, so hold me  
It hates you, so hold me  
It holds you, so hold me  
  
Until it sleeps  
  
I don't want it  
  
So tear me open, but beware  
The things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me, 'till I'm clean  
  
I'll tear me open, make you gone  
No longer will you hurt anyone  
And the fear still shapes me  
So hold me, until it sleeps  
  
Until it sleeps
