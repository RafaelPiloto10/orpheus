If I can only, make you see  
That you were only, meant for me, now  
Our love will be free  
And I'll be your destiny  
Destiny, destiny, right, now, now, now, babe  
  
If I can make you only understand  
Treat me right and love me  
Then I will be your man  
Your one and only man  
  
These are the words  
That I have to say  
Live by them each and every day, now  
And as the time pass  
I know our love will last, our love will last, our love will last  
Now, now, now babe  
  
Take me blue  
Understand them  
Live by them and love me  
Then I will be your man  
Your one and only man  
  
These are the words  
That I have to say  
Just live by them each and every day, now  
And as the time pass  
I know our love will last, our love will last, our love will last  
Now  
  
Take me blue  
Understand them  
Live by them and love me  
Honey I will be your man  
I said your one and only man  
  
Yes your truly lovely man  
Yes your lovely lovely man  
You don't need nobody to do nothing for you baby  
I said I could just love and be just one guy that you need  
I could say I could be one guy that you love  
I could just be anyone you want me to be, now, now  
I said I could be just anyone you want me to be  
Darling, baby, my, my, my, my baby  
Na, na, wow
