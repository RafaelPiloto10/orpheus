Thought I'd seen some changes  
Thought I knew it well  
But through my back pages  
There's a tale to tell  
Guess when I saw you  
I didn't have a chance  
Though I know her reputation  
I know I liked that first dance  
  
Was this a real love  
Or just another hot Saturday night?  
Was this a real love  
Or just another hot Saturday night?  
  
Can't stop from thinkin'  
What we could do  
Just one night there  
I finally knew  
Lookin' at the distance  
Between you and my heart  
I never knew I'd fall  
Right from the start  
  
Was this a real love  
Or just another hot Saturday night?  
Was this a real love  
Or just another hot Saturday night?  
  
This is one time you can't walk away  
This time I've got to stay
