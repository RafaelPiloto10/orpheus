Heaven I need a drug  
Her eyes are all but fixed upon her coffee cup  
And looking down she tells you things are looking up  
Take another slug  
  
Heaven I had a dream  
But now my life's a nightmare of efficiency  
She rattles off the things she never got for free  
Gearing up to scream  
  
I remember when  
I had you and you had so much promise then  
You promised me that you would never leave again  
To be broken you were made, Adelaide  
  
Heaven I need a rest  
I recognized the voices talking in my head  
I couldn't make out everything the voices said  
Loving you is a test  
  
I remember when  
I had you and you had so much promise then  
You promised me that you would never leave again  
To be broken you were made, Adelaide  
  
Heaven I need a drink  
I'm here because they're paying me to do my thing  
They never specify what it is I should bring  
I'm right up on the brink  
  
I remember when  
I had you and you had so much promise then  
You promised me that you would never leave again  
To be broken you were made, Adelaide  
  
I remember when  
I had you and you had so much promise then  
You promised me that you would never leave again  
  
To be broken you were made, Adelaide  
To be broken you were made, Adelaide  
To be broken
