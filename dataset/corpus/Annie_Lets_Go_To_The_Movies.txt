Grace: Cowboy heroes,  
Cops and robbers,  
Glamour and strife,  
Bigger than life!  
Sitting in the darkness,  
What a world to see!  
Let's go to the movies,  
Annie, wait and see.  
  
Bette Davis is probably lying,  
And Greta Garbo is probably crying,  
While Robert Taylor  
Is locked in her dying embrace.  
Chico and Groucho  
And Chaplin and Lloyd  
Are all super.  
Sweet Mickey Mouse,  
Shirley Temple,  
And dear Jackie Cooper.  
  
Annie: Let's go to the movies...  
  
Both: Let's go see the stars  
  
Grace: Fred and Ginger  
Spinning madly...  
[Instrumental]  
Anything you  
Can imagine...  
Songs and romance.  
Life is the dance.  
Sitting in the darkness,  
Popcorn on your knee!  
Give the maid the night off!  
  
Warbucks: Turn the kitchen light off!  
  
Grace and Warbucks: Let's go to the movies,  
Annie, you and me!  
  
Ushers: Welcome to the movies!  
Welcome to the stars!  
Welcome to this  
Grand illusion.  
All of it's yours  
Right through these doors!  
Every plot's a dilly,  
This we guarantee!  
Welcome to the movies  
Wait and see.  
  
Female chorus: Let's go to the movies (see the movies)

Only happy endings (boy gets girl, yes)  
That's our recipe!  
Welcome to a lovely  
M-O-V-I-E!
