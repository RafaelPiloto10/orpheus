It wasn't just the music  
It wasn't just the wine  
Some other kind of magic  
Sending shivers up my spine  
And I was falling  
And I fell for you and how  
Darling, are we in trouble now?  
  
They say we're grown up  
We've been searching all this time  
And I wouldn't own up  
Never would admit to flying blind  
But in the darkness  
We found each other anyhow  
Darling, are we in trouble now?  
  
When we talk it over  
Our love was a cry from a distant shore  
Then we found each other  
And all that we'd been searching for  
  
And I'm done denying  
Yeah, I guess by now you know  
I'm through with trying  
Can't bring myself to let you go  
And all these feelings  
Said we never would allow  
Darling, are we in trouble now?  
Darling are we in trouble now?
