Hey, if you're moving too fast  
Don't you want this thing last  
But if you start moving slow and -  
Hey, pretty mama, you just will have to go, because -  
It's nobody's business but my own  
It's nobody's business but my own  
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no  
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no  
But if you start acting mean  
Then I'll have to mess up the scene  
But if you start treating me nice  
Hey, now baby, I'm gonna have to raise your price  
Because it's nobody's business but my own  
It's nobody's business but my own  
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no  
No-no-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no  
Nobody's business  
Nobody's business, come on now  
Hey, nobody's business, yeah, but my own  
Nobody's business, oh, my, no-no-no  
Nobody's business, no-no-no-no-no  
Hey, nobody's business, yeah, but my own  
Nobody's business, my own  
No-no, no-no-no  
No-no-no, no-no-no  
Nobody's business  
Nobody's business  
Nobody's business  
Nobody's business, but my own, now  
...
