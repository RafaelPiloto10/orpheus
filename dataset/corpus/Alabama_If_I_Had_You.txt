If I Had You  
Alabama  
Album: For The Record  
  
If I had you we'd run like gypsies in the wind  
We'd be lovers and we'd be friends, if I had you  
If I had you we'd count the stars all one by one  
We'd make love till they were gone oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger  
'Cause there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, no there's nothing  
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
  
If I had you, we'd sail the seven seas as one  
We'd never say it can't be done, oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, oh, there's nothing  
I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
If I had you...
