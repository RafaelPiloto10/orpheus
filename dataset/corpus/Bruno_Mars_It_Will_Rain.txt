If you ever leave me baby,  
Leave some morphine at my door  
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication  
To realize what we used to have,  
We don't have it anymore.  
  
There's no religion that could save me  
No matter how long my knees are on the floor  
Ooh so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'  
Will keep you by my side  
Will keep you from walkin' out the door.  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
I'll never be your mother's favorite  
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye  
Ooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing  
Sayin there goes my little girl  
Walkin' with that troublesome guy  
  
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand  
Ooh but little darlin' watch me change their minds  
Yea for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try  
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding  
If that'll make you mine  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
Don't you say, goodbye  
Don't you say, goodbye  
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding  
If that'll make it right  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain
