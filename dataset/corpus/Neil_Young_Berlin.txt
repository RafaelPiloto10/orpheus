Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
I'm singing out  
The same old song  
Can't go back  
The way I started from  
The road goes on and on  
Won't you help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Take my way on home  
Help me make my way on home  
After Berlin.  
  
Lights are shining  
In the German sky  
Cosmic walls  
Between the moon and I  
Don't know where I started from  
So won't you take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Just the way I am  
Ah, take me, just the way I am  
After Berlin.  
  
All day cruising  
Down the corridor  
Seeing things  
I never seen before  
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin  
Where they lock you out  
Or lock you in  
Won't you save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
From the final day  
Save me from the final day  
After Berlin.  
  
Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
I'm singing out  
The same old song  
I can't go back  
The way I used to go  
The road goes on and on  
Won't you help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Find my way back home  
Won't you help me  
Make my way on home  
After Berlin.  
  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me.  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me.
