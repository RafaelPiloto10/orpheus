Keep off of that friend of mine, ah-ah-ah  
He's not for you, ah-ah-ah  
He just wants to spin you a line, ah-ah-ah  
There's nothin' new ah-ah-ah  
Just one thought on his mind  
You know it's that kind you shoulda  
Known when you met him you must be blind  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
That girl was mine in every way  
People couldn't part us if they tried  
Now she's turned her head away  
She's lost her smile she's not so gay  
Won't you come back to my side
