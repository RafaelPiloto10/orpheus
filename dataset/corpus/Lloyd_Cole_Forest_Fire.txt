She crossed herself as she put on her things  
She has promised once before not to live this way  
If she don't calm down she will burn herself out  
Like a forest fire, well doesn't that make you smile  
  
If you don't slow down, I swear that I'll come round  
And mess up your place, let's go for a spin  
They say we shouldn't even know each other  
And that we'll be undone  
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire  
  
I believe in love, I'll believe in anything  
That's gonna get me what I want and get me off my knees  
Then we'll burn your house down, don't it feel so good  
There's a forest fire every time we get together  
  
Hey pick you up, put you down  
Rip you up and spin you round  
Just like we said we would  
'Cause we're a forest fire  
Believe you me, we'll tear this place down  
  
If we get caught in this wind, then we could burn the ocean  
If we get caught in this scene, we're gonna be undone  
It's just a simple metaphor  
It's for a burning love  
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire
