Born with the fire in my blood,  
Can't live without it.  
Something that gold can never buy.  
It doesn't matter who you are,  
Or what your thinking,  
If you believe in what you try.  
  
Feel the fire,  
Your burning desire.  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with fire  
Fire, feel it burning higher  
  
If you are rich, or if you are poor,  
There is no difference,  
It's still in what you're fighting for.  
If you are strong you will survive,  
You'll feel the fire,  
Burning on forever more.  
  
Feel the fire  
Your burning desire  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with desire  
You never play with fire.  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with desire  
You never play with fire.
