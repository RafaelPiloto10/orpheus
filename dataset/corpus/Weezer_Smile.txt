Open the door  
And let your love come down  
Over the wall  
You're spinning 'round and 'round  
'Cause you wanted some love  
I'll make it happen  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
You say you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
Open your heart  
And let the good stuff out  
Water me girl  
And let me ease the drought  
  
'Cause you wanted some love  
I'll make it happen  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
The way you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
I can't be gone...darlin'  
For very long...oh  
Let me know what you're gonna do  
Standing there deep in front of you  
Take a look in between my eyes  
'Cause I'm back...yeah  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
The way you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
I can't be gone...darlin'  
For very long...oh  
Let me know what you're gonna do  
Standing there deep in front of you  
Take a look in between my eyes  
Because I'm back...yeah  
  
Give me a chance  
If you can force yourself  
Look at me girl  
And get up off your shelf  
  
You wanted some love  
I'll make it happen
