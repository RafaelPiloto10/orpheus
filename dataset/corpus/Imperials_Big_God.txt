My God's a big God  
He walks among the mountains  
My God's a big God  
He rises from the sea my God's a big God  
The stars surround his shoulders  
My God's a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My God's a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My God's a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
  
My God's a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My God's a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My God's a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My God's a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
My God's a big God he walks among the mountains  
My God's a big God he rises from the sea  
My God's a big God the stars surround his shoulders  
My God's a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My God's a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My God's a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
My Gods a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My God's a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My God's a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My God's a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
Chorus
