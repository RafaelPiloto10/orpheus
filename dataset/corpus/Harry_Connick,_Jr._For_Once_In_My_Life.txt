For once in my life I have someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so  
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
For once I can say: "this is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
Now, for once I can say: "this is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me  
For once in my life, she needs me  
For once in my life
