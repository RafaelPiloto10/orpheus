The love the love is  
Bigger  
The love the love is  
Bigger  
The love the love is  
Bigger  
Big  
  
Gotta believe in me  
Believe me like a fairytale  
Put your tooth under your pillowcase  
And know I won't I won't  
Ever ever let you down (no)  
Like a seesaw let you down (oh)  
You know why  
'Cause we ain't in the playground no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
Whoa oh  
Remember when my heart was young  
You were still bigger than me  
Is that the reason that you stayed  
Most would've got rid of me  
Now the bully's in the school yard  
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us  
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that  
(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like yesterday  
(They shine on me) We were little then  
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby  
You wow wow (You wow wow)  
Since then all I can remember is the love only got bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
Oh
