TURN YOUR RADIO ON  
Writer Albert E. Brumley  
Come and listen in to a radio station, where the mighty host of Heaven sing,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on), turn your radio on (turn your radio
on),  
If you want to want to hear the songs of Zion,  
Coming from the land of endless spring,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God)  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on).  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And listen to the music in the air,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And glory to share (glory share)  
Turn the lights down low (lights down low)  
And listen to the Master's Radio,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God)  
Turn your radio on.  
Brother, listen in to the gloryland chorus,  
Listen to the glad hosannahs roll,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
Get a little taste of joys awaiting,  
Get a little Heaven in your soul,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God)  
Turn your radio on.  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And listen to the music in the air,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And glory to share (glory share)  
Turn the lights down low (lights down low)  
And listen to the Master's Radio,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God)  
Turn your radio on.  
Listen to the songs of the fathers and the mothers,  
And the many friends gone on before,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on),  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on),  
Some eternal morning we shall meet them,  
Over on the Hallelujah Shore,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God),  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on).  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And listen to the music in the air,  
Turn your radio on (turn your radio on)  
And glory to share (glory share)  
Turn the lights down low (lights down low)  
And listen to the Master's Radio,  
Get in touch with God (get in touch with God)  
Turn your radio on.
