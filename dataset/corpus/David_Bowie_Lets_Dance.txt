Let's dance  
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues  
Let's dance  
Dance to the song they're playing on the radio  
Let's sway  
While color lights up your face  
Let's sway  
Sway through the crowd to an empty space  
  
If you say run, I'll run with you  
If you say hide, we'll hide  
Watch my love for you  
It would break my heart in two  
If you should fall into my arms  
And tremble like a flower  
  
Let's dance  
For fear your grace should fall  
Let's dance  
For fear tonight is all  
Let's sway  
You can look into my eyes  
Let's sway  
Underthe moonlight, the Sirius moonlight  
  
If you say run, I'll run with you  
If you say hide, we'll hide  
Watch my love for you  
It would break my heart in two  
If you should fall into my arms  
And tremble like a flower  
  
Let's dance  
Let's dance  
Let's dance, let's dance  
Let's dance, let's dance
