When I was just a little boy we lived down on a farm  
Seven miles from nowhere and a hundred miles from harm  
We made our livin' from the dirt if anything would grow  
And we got our country music from a big old radio  
And we had Bill Monroe for breakfast every day  
Then we'd head out to the fields a hoein' corn and mowin' hay  
Aw mama loved his singin' daddy loved to hear him play  
And we had Bill Monroe for breakfast every day  
  
[Fiddle - Mandolin ]  
  
We had a big old battery that ran the radio  
Sometimes we run it down a listenin' to the Oprah Show  
But we all had our instruments and most of us could play  
So we had Bill Monroe for breakfast anyway  
We had Bill Monroe for breakfast...  
Mama was a lady and my daddy liked to preach  
All we ever had was just a place to eat and sleep  
If I could go back home again back to the simple ways  
Oh we'd have Bill Monroe for breakfast every day  
We had Bill Monroe for breakfast...  
We had Bill Monroe for breakfast every day
