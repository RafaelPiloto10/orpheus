Little Mary was five years old  
Her parents left her, she was out in the cold  
Alone to live and find her way  
In this great world of heartache and pain  
  
Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold  
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled  
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare  
Who could have left a child so rare  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm beggin you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
A burning heart and tired eyes  
Howling winds for lullabys  
No one there to soothe her fright  
Nowhere to turn but the inward light  
Because life is for believing  
That your heart can turn to gold  
All you need is Christ to receive it  
There's eternal life for every soul  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm begging you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
He loves you He needs you He wants you  
So don't let Him down
