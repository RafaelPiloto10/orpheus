One, two, three!  
My baby don't mess around  
Cause she loves me so  
This I know fo sho!  
  
But does she really wanna  
But can't stand to see me walk out tha door  
Don't try to fight the feeling  
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now

But got it just don't get it when there's nothin' at all  
We get together  
Oh, we get together  
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved  
Know what they say -its:  
Nothing lasts forever!  
Then what makes it, then what makes it  
Then what makes it, then what makes it  
Then what makes love the exception?
