Your love like wine  
Tasting sweeter to me everyday  
Your kiss, divine and it melts the cold inside away  
All of my life I've been waiting for a love like this  
And now that you're here, romance is just a second away  
It's gonna stay  
  
Till the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
Till the Mojave Red turns into blue  
When my lungs get tired of breathing  
And my heart stops its beating  
Then I'll stop loving you  
  
And if the dark, when there's no one calling out your name  
Well I'll hold you so tight  
And I'll whisper to you once again and again  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless start praying  
I'll stop loving you  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara (oh, oh)  
And the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When my lungs get tired of breathing  
And my heart stops its beating  
I'll stop loving you  
I don't want to miss a single heartbeat  
  
Sometimes my words get in the way  
But I hear your love just fine  
Just fine  
And its gonna take a long time  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless stop praying  
I'll stop loving you  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless stop praying  
I'll stop loving you
