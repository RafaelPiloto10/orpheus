Come to me you weary one  
And I will give you rest, I will give you rest  
Come to me you weary one  
And I will give you rest, I will give you rest  
For my own is easy and my burden is light  
Take me upon you, I will give you rest  
  
Come to me you broken one  
And I will give you peace, I will give you peace  
Come to me you broken one  
And I will give you peace, I will give you peace  
You will calm your waters, and I will whisper peace be still  
Take me upon you, I will give you peace  
  
Come to me, Come to me  
Come to me  
I have been waiting for you here  
I have been waiting for you here  
  
Come to me you burdened one  
And I will give you joy, I will give you joy  
Come to me you burdened one  
And I will give you joy, I will give you joy  
You will rise like eagles, and my joy will be your strength  
Take me upon you, I will give you joy  
  
Come to me, Come to me  
Come to me  
I have been waiting for you here  
He has been waiting for you here  
  
Come, Come to Him  
Come find your peace  
Come find your rest  
Come find your joy  
He is waiting here for you, he is waiting here for you  
With open arms, to hold you, to embrace your heart  
To love you  
He is waiting here, He is waiting here
