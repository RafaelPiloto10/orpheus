Tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
Wake up your time is nearly over  
No more the supernova  
No action guaranteed  
  
Wake up you've had an operation  
Ideals above your station  
Too much reality  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Wake up you're on your own agenda  
Give up the great pretender  
With baby eyes of green  
  
Wake up you're holding on to nothing  
You know you're only bluffing  
As dead as autumn leaves  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Don't you just love a happy ending?  
Oh yeah well so do I  
And all your love will shine on everyone  
  
The darkness of the day  
A curse in every way  
You try to see the light  
But you don't know why  
Don't know why  
  
They tell you on the phone  
To give your God a bone  
And grow a set of wings like a butterfly  
  
The guardian at the gate  
Reminds you that you're late  
You try to take your time  
But you tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
To children of the world  
And daddy's little girl  
The grass is always green on the other side  
So stay and breathe new life  
  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
  
Wake up, wake up  
Everything is moving faster than you think  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Your pen is running out of ink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Fill up your bath and kitchen sink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
They're really kicking up a stink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You never found the missing link  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You should be happy in the pink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You're in demand but out of sync  
(Wake up, wake up)  
A nod is as good as a wink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Once more my dear friends to the brink  
  
All your love will shine on everyone
