Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all my friends  
Better take a look  
At the colors of the people  
  
[Chorus]  
Young without lovers  
Old without friends  
  
Better say a prayer  
For the poor and unhealthy  
Better sing a song  
For those who don't care  
Let the people have the right  
To be different  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is an abstraction  
And it tries to fool us all  
And it's working so far it seems  
Brother against brother  
This world is such a mess  
Behind the drawn curtains  
So our thoughts can not be seen  
  
Better shake the hand  
Of the hated  
Better hear the words  
That don't seem clear  
Better take a look around  
At what we're doing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all of my friends  
Let the people have the right  
To be different  
  
[Chorus: x3]
