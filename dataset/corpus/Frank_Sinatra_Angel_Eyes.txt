Hey drink up all you people  
Order anything you see  
And have fun you happy people  
The laugh and the drinks on me  
  
Try to think that love's not around  
Still it's uncomfortably near  
My poor old heart ain't gaining any ground  
Because my angel eyes ain't here  
  
Angel eyes, that old Devil sent  
They glow unbearably bright  
Need I say that my love's misspent  
Misspent with angel eyes tonight  
  
So drink up all of you people  
Order anything you see  
And have fun you happy people  
The drink and the laughs on me  
  
Pardon me but I got to run  
The fact's uncommonly clear  
I got to find who's now the number one  
And why my angel eyes ain't here  
  
Excuse me while I disappear
