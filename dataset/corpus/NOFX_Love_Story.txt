Partly owned tuder house  
Wooden white picket fence  
Mother waits for father  
In a backless dress  
Hardly used a diaphram  
Put back into its case  
A one way trip down memory lane  
As she awaits  
I don't want to know  
Cheat me  
  
I don't want to know  
Children play in the yard  
Mother stares at the wall  
Father says he's gonna be back late  
So don't wait up  
About a quater to 3  
Father stares at the wall  
Stained thicker than water  
Who's gonna clean it up
