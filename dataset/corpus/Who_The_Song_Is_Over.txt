The song is over  
It's all behind me  
I should have known it  
She tried to find me  
  
Our love is over  
They're all ahead now  
I've got to learn it  
I'm gonna to sing out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
When I walked in through the door  
Thought it was me I was looking for  
She was the first song I ever sang  
But it stopped as soon as it began  
  
Our love is over  
It's all behind me  
They're all ahead now  
Can't hope to find me  
  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
This song is over  
I'm left with only tears  
I must remember  
Even if it takes a million years  
  
The song is over  
The song is over  
  
Searchin' for a note, pure and easy  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by
