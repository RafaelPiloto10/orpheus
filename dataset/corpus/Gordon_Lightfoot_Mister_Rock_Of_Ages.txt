Mister Rock of Ages you got time on your hands  
Got no worries, got no plans  
Bless my soul now you're doin' fine  
You ain't got no axe to grind  
  
Rock of Ages tell me where does it stand  
Are we bound for the promised land  
Bless my soul, I ain't ready to die  
And my future is in your hands  
  
Mister Rock of Ages you've been goin' on strong  
Since time began, til time is done  
And so the tide shall run  
  
Mister Rock of Ages tell me what do you see  
Are we bound for eternity  
Bless my soul, baby you're doin' fine  
You ain't got no axe to grind  
  
Rock of Ages you've got nothing to hide  
Got no ego, got no pride  
Bless my soul, let me do what I can  
For my future is in your hands  
  
Mister Rock of Ages, the lord of my lease  
In times of toil and times of peace  
Until my song shall cease  
  
Mister Rock of Ages, I'm a part of you now  
I am yours, you belong to be  
Bless my soul, let me do what I can  
For my future is in your hands
