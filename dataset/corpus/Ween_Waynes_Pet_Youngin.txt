Morgan's pain succumbs to the frame  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
Astral plane conversing lame  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
  
A stained pane drownin' out the rain  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
You name the game and I'll bring Dwayne  
And Roger and Rerun to Wayne's pet youngin'  
  
Rerun's brain - confetti stain  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
What's your name? Are you glad you came?  
But would you die in the name of Wayne's pet youngin'?  
Yes I would! Aaaahhhh!  
  
Ahahahahahahahaha!  
Ahahahahahahahaha!  
Ha ha!
