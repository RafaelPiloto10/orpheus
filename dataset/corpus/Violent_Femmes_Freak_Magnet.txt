Some magnets attract  
Some magnets repel  
Some magnets say  
"Hey, hey, what the hell?"  
Take it both ways  
First you come and then you go  
And then you turn around and P.A.Y.S.  
It stays, yes, it stays, no  
I don't know what you're doin' here  
I don't even want you near  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet  
Well, the birds of a feather  
Will fly and flock together  
And the letter will come whether  
It's good or bad weather  
There's a cut on my knees  
'Cause I need to freeze  
And there's a cord on my coat  
'Cause I need to cut that rope  
And you're talkin' like sleeze  
And you're lookin' like disease  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I don't wanna date you  
I don't wanna rape you  
I don't wanna kiss you  
I will never miss you  
Because some magnets repel  
And some magnets attract  
And some magnets retreat  
And then attack, attack, attack  
I want it both ways  
First I come and then you go  
And you're the one of us, who pays  
Who says yes? I say, "No"  
I don't even want you here  
What the fuck you doin' here  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a  
Seem like a, seem like a, uhh  
I'm, I'm, I'm  
Freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
I'm a freak magnet  
Callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet  
Hey, I'm callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet  
Hey, I'm callin' all the freaks  
From the freak, freak planet  
I'm a freak magnet
