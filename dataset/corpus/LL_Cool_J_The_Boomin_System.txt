Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin'  
  
Yeah alright  
But we need a beat that they can front to  
Oh, that'll work  
Be funky  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)  
(Cars ride by)  
  
Funky  
For all the cars out there  
And all the brothers  
That like to front in their rides  
Check it out  
  
You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say  
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay  
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around  
12 o'clock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots  
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots  
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they don't understand why I act this way  
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day  
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently  
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock  
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming  
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling  
A right-hand man's here without the swing  
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow  
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n  
That means I'm chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a base-head would say I want bass  
I want a hit, I want a dose  
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk  
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what I'm saying  
Word  
So next time you're in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
It's Cool  
  
Peace
