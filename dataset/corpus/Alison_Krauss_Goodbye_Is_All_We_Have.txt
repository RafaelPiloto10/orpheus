I'm soaring the sky  
I can hear the birds and man they don't lie  
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this high  
  
I'm moving on  
I got the words to a brand new song  
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this close  
  
Chorus:  
Gone tomorrow here today  
Just in case you got somethin' to say  
I'll be leaving with the breast of  
Goodbye is all we have  
  
I disconnected the phone  
Told the neighbors I'll be heading home  
As soon as the light hits the morn  
  
I'm heading north  
Gonna see what this heart's really worth  
I guess it's time to be on my own  
  
(Chorus)  
  
I sure would love to see you tonight  
Maybe try to end this fight  
If I don't hear you knockin' on my door  
Then I'll know for sure  
  
(Chorus)
