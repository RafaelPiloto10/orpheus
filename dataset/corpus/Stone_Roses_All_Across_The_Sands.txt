But of an impressive romance  
Scattered all across the sands  
A secret safe with all the world  
Too vain to seem so capable  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can you hear it calling  
Do you feel warmer  
As the hired hand's exposed  
  
How can a pretty painting show  
Send them all packing out to Hell  
A freight train laughs and rattles by  
You kissed the girls and made them die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll never come here again  
Ah, we will never come here again  
Ah, we will never play here again, again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After her call  
After her call  
After [sic] her call  
And she calls
