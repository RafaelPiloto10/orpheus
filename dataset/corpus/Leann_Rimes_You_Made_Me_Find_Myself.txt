Bet you thought my world  
was over  
Bet you thought I'd crash and burn  
You thought I'd never  
Pick myself up off the floor  
But baby you were wrong  
Just like before  
  
[Chorus]  
I used to breathe you  
I used to need you  
I used to hang on every word  
that you say  
It used to please you  
To try to make me  
someone else  
And I thank you from  
My heart for your help  
Cause you made me find  
myself  
  
I used to think if I surrendered  
I'd be the perfect one for you  
But I swear I can't remember  
A single day of happiness with  
you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No I'm not going back in time  
And there's a price for being  
strong  
But I can live with who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You made me find my dreams  
You made me find my love  
You made me find myself  
Thank you, thank you
