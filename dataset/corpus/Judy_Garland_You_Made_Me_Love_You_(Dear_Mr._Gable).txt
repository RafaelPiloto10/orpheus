Dear Mr Gable  
I am writing this to you  
And I hope that you  
Will read it so you'll know  
  
My heart beats like a hammer  
And I stutter and I stammer  
Every time I see you at the picture show  
I guess I'm just another fan of yours  
And I thought I'd write and tell you so  
  
You made me love you  
I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
  
You made me happy  
Sometimes you made me glad  
But there were times, sir  
You made me feel so sad  
  
You made me sigh 'cause  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I think you're grand, that's true  
Yes I do, 'deed I do, you know I do  
  
I must tell you what I'm feeling  
The very mention of your name  
Sends my heart reeling  
You know you made me love you  
  
Aw, gee, Mr Gable  
I don't wanna bother you  
Guess, guess you got a lotta girls  
That tell you the same thing  
  
And if you don't wanna read this  
Well, you don't have to  
But I just had to tell you about the time  
I saw you in, "It Happened One Night"  
  
That was the first time I ever saw you  
And I knew right then  
You were the nicest fella in the movies  
I guess it was 'cause you acted so  
Well, so natural like  
  
Not like a real actor at all  
But just like any fella you'd meet  
At school or at a party  
Then one time I saw you in a picture  
With Joan Crawford  
  
And I had to cry a little  
'Cause you loved her so much  
And you couldn't have her  
Not 'til the end of the picture, anyway  
  
And then one time I saw you in person  
You going to the Coconut Grove  
One night and I was standing there  
When you got out of your car  
  
And you almost knocked me down  
Oh, but it wasn't your fault  
I was in the way  
But you looked at me and you smiled  
  
Yeah, you smiled right at me  
As if you meant it  
And I cried all the way home  
Just 'cause you smiled at me  
For being in your way  
Aw, I'll never forget it, Mr Gable  
Honest angel, you're my favorite actor  
  
I don't care what happens  
Let the whole world stop  
As far as I'm concerned  
You'll always be the top  
'Cause you know  
You made me love you
