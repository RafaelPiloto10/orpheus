Afternoon, see a guy with rubies on his head  
And he's shifting like shifting like he was dead  
And he's hearing something, she never said  
On his way back home, under his bed  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
  
In the night there's a girl who doesn't mind her ragged sleeves  
Knowing someone soon is gonna grieve  
And a man he tells her a story, she just won't believe  
Called "Adam never could do right by Eve"  
  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
Down on you, down on me  
And a girl walks by the burning bush  
She asks "what's going on here man?"  
And he smiles, says "open wide, wide, wide"  
  
In my dreams, a candy coated train comes to my door  
With a little girl, I can't have anymore  
You know a letter washes up to the shore  
That I cannot read and I probably should ignore  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down
