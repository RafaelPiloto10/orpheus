[Intro]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
[Verse 1]  
I've never been so caught up  
Still so into us  
I never thought I'd be here  
Should've turned to dust  
Ooh, let's be honest, baby  
This is so unusual  
Ooh, and I'm not tempted, baby  
Even if they're beautiful  
I used to be cautious  
A little too reckless  
Now all my emotions  
Are all cause of you  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere  
I don't even see it down the road  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
Not even sometimes  
  
[Interlude]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ooh, let's be honest, baby  
This is so unusual  
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby  
Even if they're beautiful  
It used to be easy  
For someone to steal me  
Now all my emotions  
Are all cause of you, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere  
I don't even see it down the road  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
Not even sometimes, babe  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
Why it never worked, but it's going to now  
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know  
What it does to me when I feel you around  
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?  
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there  
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there  
Hard to breathe when you're not here  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere  
I don't even see it down the road  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
Not even sometimes  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Not even sometimes  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go (no way)  
Not even sometimes  
  
[Outro]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Not even sometimes  
Not even sometimes  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Not even sometimes  
Not even sometimes
