No matter where I roam  
I will "Return" to my English rose  
For no bonds can ever tempt me from she  
I've sailed the seven seas,  
Flown the whole blue sky.  
But I've returned with haste to where my  
Love does lie.  
No matter where I go I will "Return" to my English Rose  
For nothing can ever tempt me from she.  
I've searched the secret mists  
I've climbed the highest peaks  
Caught the wild wind home  
To hear her soft voice speak  
No matter where I roam  
I will return to my English Rose  
For no bonds can ever keep me from she.  
  
I've been to ancient worlds  
I've scoured the whole universe  
And caught the first train home  
To be at her side.  
No matter where I roam  
I will return to my English Rose  
For no bonds, nothing and no-one can ever keep me from she
