There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
I remember now that I'm older  
What you told me the day we had to part  
You promised with the new moon  
You'd be coming back to me  
Now many moons have passed  
Since then I'm waiting patiently  
There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
So I'll keep on praying  
For your safe return someday  
And that we'll be the same sweethearts  
As when you went away  
There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart
