Don't you know I had a dream last night  
That you were here with me  
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm  
And we talked a while  
And shared a smile  
And then we shared the dawn  
But when I woke up  
Oh, my dream it was gone  
Don't you know I had a dream last night  
You were here with me  
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm  
And you said you'd thought it over  
Said that you were comin' home  
But then I woke up  
From my dream it was gone  
I'm not the same  
Can you blame me  
Is it hard to understand  
I can't forget  
You can't change me  
I am not that kind of man  
Don't you know I had a dream last night  
When everything was still  
And you were by my side so soft and warm  
And I dreamed that we were lovers  
In the lemon-scented rain  
But the I woke up  
Oh, I found that again  
I had been dreamin'  
Dreamin' again  
I had been dreamin'  
Dreamin' again
