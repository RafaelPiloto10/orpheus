[Chorus]  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
  
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid  
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid  
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid  
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid  
I got a pool that I never even swam in  
Airports that you bitches never land in  
They be like what you doing Nicki?  
Brandin'  
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landin'  
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Presley  
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley  
Why these bitches so pressed, B?  
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B  
I'ma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes  
I'm the Sandro, paid on a big boat  
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat  
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won another round, Willin', get the ref  
Got the clothing line poppin' and the wigs is next  
When I fly you know G5 is the jet  
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth  
Meetings with the president of every network  
That is what the fuck I call how to network  
My net worth, that net works  
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work  
Chillin' with executives  
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive  
Trillion dollar deficit  
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit  
B-bitches ain't got punchlines or flow  
I have both and an empire also  
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo  
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low  
F-flow's sick, I-I'll slap a patient  
I'm checkin' these bitches like an application  
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation  
So it's off with your head, decapitation  
S-s-s-send 'em up in flames like a firemen  
I do the hirin' and I do the firin'  
That boss shit that you talk, I live it  
And I'm callin' a travel if you don't stay on your pivot  
Bitches  
  
[Chorus]
