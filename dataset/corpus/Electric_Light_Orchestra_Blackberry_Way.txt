Blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain,  
It's a terrible day.  
Up with the lark, silly girl i don't know what to say,  
She was running away.  
But now I'm standing on the corner,  
Lost in the things that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare  
There's a memory there.  
Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown  
I'm incredibly down.  
Just like myself they are neglected,  
Turn with my eyes to the wall  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Run for the train, look behind you for she may be there  
Said a thing in the air  
Blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins  
Cast to the winds  
So full of emptiness without her,  
Lost in the words that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.
