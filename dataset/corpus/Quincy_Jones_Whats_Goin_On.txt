Sister, sister, sister  
Sister, sister, sister  
  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
  
Mother, mother  
There's too many of you crying  
Brother, brother, brother  
There's far too many of you dying  
You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here today  
  
Father, father  
We don't need to escalate  
War is not the answer  
For only love can conquer hate  
You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some loving here today  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Don't punish me with brutality  
Talk to me so you can see  
  
What's goin' on  
Oh, what's going on  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
  
Yeah, what's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on  
What's goin' on
