There's nobody on the end of my line  
I'm in time but somebody's missing  
Maybe I can find a hand for my hand  
If I find a well for my wishing  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
It gets lonely on a table for two  
Laughing on your own can be no fun  
Even people that are talking to you  
Remind you that you're really with no-one  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
Take me over like a thing from the past  
Lots of people wishing they'd been there  
No-one knowing just how long it would last  
But I'm sitting still here in my chair  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
Forty-five hundred times I told you how much I care  
Forty-five hundred times I told you how much I care  
Problems halved are the problems that we can share  
White lies in our eyes, together not really there  
  
Forty-five hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Forty-five hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Though it's taken a long time for you to see  
Where we're at is the right place for us to be  
  
I sure want to stay here, it sure feels fine  
I feel I could be here a long long time  
Now that I've made it, I don't want to fade it  
Now that I've made it with you  
  
We came a long way, a slow way too  
Up from the down way and back to you  
Now that I've made it I don't want to fade it  
Now that I've made it with you
