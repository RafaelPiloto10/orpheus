Please  
Come over to 81st street I'm in the apartment  
Above the bar  
You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway  
And the tacky store with the mylar scarves  
My skin's as pale as outdoors moon  
My hair's silver like a Tiffany watch  
I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello  
And please don't touch  
  
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me  
The way to make friends Andy is invite them up for tea  
Open house  
Open house  
  
I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite  
She's lady called Sam  
I made a paper doll of her, you can have it  
That's what I did when I had St. Vitus dance  
  
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me  
Give people little presents so they remember me  
Open house  
Open house  
  
Someone bring the vegetables  
Someone please bring heat  
My mother showed up yesterday  
We need something to eat  
  
I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes  
The ones I drew were old and used  
They told me to draw something new  
Open house  
Open house  
  
Fly me to the moon  
Fly me to a star  
But there are no stars in the New York sky  
They're all on the ground  
  
You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint  
I drew 550 different shoes today, it almost made me faint  
Open house  
Open house  
Open house  
Open house
