Come and gather around at the table  
In the spirit of family and friends  
And we'll all join hands and remember this moment  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
Let's all try to smile for the picture  
And we'll hold it as long as we can  
May it carry us through  
Should we ever get lonely  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus:]  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire,  
Let's lift our heads high  
And be thankful we're here  
'Til this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed  
With good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
And we'll love and we'll laugh  
In the time that we had  
'Til the season comes 'round again
