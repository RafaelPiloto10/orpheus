I like the love  
And I like the peaceful  
I wish everyone I know could  
Stand in the heartlight  
I hold the hand  
I walk with the teacher  
We welcome in the mornin'  
Singing together  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can you see the flame we got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
I'm like the rain  
'Cause I like your thunder  
I know we've learned to live together  
Here in the heartlight  
Stand in the dark  
Oh, oh and I'll light a candle  
And then we'll dance it in the moonlight  
Until the sunrise  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can't you see the flame we've got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can't you see the flame we've got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
...
