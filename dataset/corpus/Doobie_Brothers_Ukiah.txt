People rushin' everywhere  
If they'd only slow down once  
They might find something there  
Green trees and timber land  
People workin' with their hands  
For sure a different way to live  
Gonna keep my cabin at hand  
Retreat and live off the land  
All around Ukiah, wo  
  
The mountain streams that rush on by  
Show the fish a jumpin'  
And reflect the open sky  
The fresh clean smell of the pines  
Symbol of unchanging times  
All around this sacred land  
Strangely, though, I've found my way  
Right here I'm gonna stay  
In this land Ukiah, wo
