I've watched the world go by  
Outside a window  
I still can't believe where I am now  
It's been forever long  
Adventures come and gone  
And I'm left alone but not let down  
  
'Cause I have found a gravity  
A voice that pulls me to my knees  
Telling me "Remember where you're from"  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
It's in every word I've sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This we'll always be home  
  
I've thought about the day  
When I could truly say I'm better now  
Well here I am  
'Cause I have left this gravity  
Grab a hold and carry me  
And I will not forget where I am from  
Forget where I am from  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
It's in every word I've sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This we'll always be home  
Always be home, always be home  
  
The sun lays down inside the ocean  
I'm right where I belong  
Feel the air, the salt on my skin  
The future's coming on  
And after living through these wild years  
I'm coming out alive  
I just wanna lay my head here  
And stop running for a while  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
It's in every word I've sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This we'll always be home  
Always be home, always be home  
This will always be home  
  
This southern air is in my lungs  
It's in every word I've sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
Is we'll always be home  
Always be home, always be home
