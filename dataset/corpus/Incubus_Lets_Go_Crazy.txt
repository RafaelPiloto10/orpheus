Dearly beloved  
We are gathered here today  
To get through this thing called life  
  
Electric word life  
That means forever and that's a mighty long time  
But I'm here to tell you  
There's something else  
The after world  
  
A world of never ending happiness  
You can always see the sun, day or night  
  
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills  
You know the one, Dr Everything will Be Alright  
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left  
Ask him how much of your mind, baby  
  
'Cause in this life  
Things are much harder than in the after world  
In this life  
You're on your own  
  
And if the elevator tries to bring u down  
Go crazy, punch a higher floor  
  
If you don't like the world you're living in  
Take a look around you  
At least you got friends  
  
You see I called my old lady  
For a friendly word  
She picked up the phone  
Dropped it on the floor  
Ah, ah is all I heard  
  
Are we gonna let the elevator  
Bring us down  
Oh, no Let's Go!  
  
Let's go crazy  
Let's get nuts  
Let's look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!  
  
We're all excited  
But we don't know why  
Maybe it's cause  
We're all gonna die  
  
And when we do (When we do)  
What's it all for (What's it all for)  
You better live now  
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door  
  
Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down  
Oh, no let's go!  
  
Let's go crazy  
Let's get nuts  
Look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!  
  
C'mon baby  
Let's get nuts  
  
Let's go crazy  
  
Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down  
Oh, no let's go!  
Go crazy  
  
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)  
Let's go, let's go  
Go  
Let's go  
  
Dr. Everything will be alright  
Will make everything go wrong  
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill  
Hang tough children  
  
He's coming  
He's coming  
Coming  
  
Take me away!
