I never was bothered by bad dreams  
They never made me afraid  
But then I never did dream I'd wake up  
And find me in the freak parade.  
  
I guess I had to find out the hard way  
I shouldn't have been so proud  
'Cause here I'm the main attraction  
Of every giggle in the crowd.  
  
So I gotta  
Take my place in the freak parade  
See my face in the freak parade.  
In a world full of freaks  
You can creep, you can crawl  
But the world's biggest freak  
Is the one with no balls.  
  
You know you shouldn't poke fun at strangers  
Or pity their case at all  
'Cause there are lots of friends and lovers  
That take it kind of personal.  
  
You might appreciate our position  
Don't laugh at our freaky ways  
You might find yourself tomorrow  
Marching in the freak parade.  
  
You better  
Take your place in the freak parade  
See your face in the freak parade  
Get of the sidewalk!
