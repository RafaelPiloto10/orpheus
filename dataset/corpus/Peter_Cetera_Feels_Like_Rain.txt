Here I go again  
Hanging on to the bitter end  
All alone  
Nothing left to lose  
Don't want to face tomorrow  
I can't sleep tonight  
Blame it on the weather  
Till I get over you.  
Chorus:  
Feels like rain  
Feels like I'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Taking down every picture  
Hanging on every wall  
Broken dreams, painfull memories  
Like the times I never listened  
And the times I didn't try  
It's gotta be the weather  
'Cause you're not here with me  
Chorus:  
Feels like rain  
Feels like I'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Regretting every minute  
Since I watched you walk away  
Cause it's not the same without you  
And now the clouds are hiding  
Every sunny day  
I guess I'll stay inside again  
Cause it feels like rain today  
Feels like rain  
Feels like we'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And the clouds are hiding every sunny day  
And the storm is coming so I'm here to stay  
'Cause it feels like rain today  
Yes, it feels like rain today
