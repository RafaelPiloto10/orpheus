TELL ME NOW who slayed oh my  
Little Baby Jane  
Rolling down the stairs  
Her Little head has rolled away  
Cause it feels so bizarre  
Put it in my hands  
Can Baby Jane come out to play?  
Show me all you got  
You don't wanna know - No you don't  
No you don't wanna know  
Wanna know  
No you don't wanna know -  
It wasn't me I know -  
No you don't wanna know  
Who slayed Baby Jane I know-  
No you don't wanna know  
No you don't wanna know  
No you don't wanna know -  
No you don't wanna know  
I wasn't me I know -  
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Can I rock your cradle?  
Oh, I love it when you scream  
Oh, I love that fixed and dilated  
Look that's in your eyes  
Than when you were alive  
I'll make you worse and more perverse  
Oh, I'll wear her face  
The she'd get me off tonight  
No You don't wanna know -  
With a big demonic smile  
If only she could scream  
No You don't wanna know  
No You don't wanna know -  
No You don't wanna know  
No You don't wanna know  
I wasn't me I know -  
Who slayed Baby Jane I know -  
No You don't wanna know  
No You don't wanna know -  
I wasn't me I know -  
No You don't wanna know  
No You don't wanna know  
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Can I rock your cradle  
Oh, I'll love it when you scream  
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Goodbye Baby Jane  
She's all right, it's alright oh my Janie  
No it ain't so strange  
You got no pain Baby Jane  
So goodbye, goodbye oh my baby
