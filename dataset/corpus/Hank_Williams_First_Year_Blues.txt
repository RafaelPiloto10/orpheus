Key ddemo recorded by hank williams, probably 1949.  
  
(d) now I've been married about six months,  
Only six (d7) months you (g) see,  
The (a7) first three months, was all ok,  
But the last three is killin (d) me,  
My wife began her hissin, cut down on her kissin,  
And then she failed to (d7) shine my (g) shoes,  
My (a7) shirts they came up wrinkled,  
My pants with dirt were sprinkled,  
And then I took the first year (d) blues.  
  
(d) well then she started naggin,  
She left the sink asaggin,  
With dishes (d7) piled up (g) high,  
No (a7) food upon the table, she said if she was able,  
Shed cook something bye and (d) bye,  
Then I began to wonder, if I had made a blunder,  
When I (d7) said I (g) do, she (a7) must have read my thinkin,  
Her eyes began to blinkin and that gal broke in -(d) - to.  
  
(d) well I heard the dishes crashin,  
And I began to dashin, gettin (d7) out of (g) sight,  
For (a7) right there was my honey,  
On who I'd spent my money, turnin into dy - na - (d) - mite,  
Then after she'd exploded, her meanness all unloaded,  
And things began to (d7) simmer (g) down,  
I (a7) found myself ableedin, and very much aneedin,  
Of stitches taken all a - (d) - round.  
  
(d) well then she started cryin, I felt myself asighin,  
And then I took her (d7) in my (g) arms,  
I (a7) was afraid to scold her, so I just gently told her,  
She didn't do a bit of (d) harm,  
Now the first six months is over, and I am much the older,  
And experienced (d7) with a (g) wife,  
If (a7) I can stand the next six, my friends all say I'll be fixed,  
To take it the rest of my (d) life.
