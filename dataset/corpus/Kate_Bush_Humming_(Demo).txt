Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many thoughts for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming  
  
Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many songs for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming  
  
Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many songs for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming
