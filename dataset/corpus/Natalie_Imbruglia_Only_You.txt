I wonder what you're thinking now, 'cause you've been up all night  
I wonder if my questioning is causing us to fight  
I'm sorry if I push too hard, your silence is all I hear  
  
Only you can hear me and only you can see through me  
Don't leave me here, will you stay for a moment  
Don't turn away 'cause you're scare you can't hold it  
You've nothing to lose but another's been broken  
I need you here  
  
Saw the way you looked at me, my heart began to sink  
Words are flying out so fast, I have no time to think  
I've never meant to cause you harm, your sadness is haunting  
  
Only you can hear me and only you can see through me  
Don't leave me here, will you stay for a moment  
Don't turn away 'cause you're scare you can't hold it  
You've nothing to lose but another's been broken  
I need you here  
  
This is harder to calm  
Now we're way down the line  
But it's all I want and I give up everything  
So find me  
I'm waiting, right here drowning in all of this  
  
Don't leave me here, will you stay for a moment  
Don't turn away 'cause you're scare you can't hold it  
You've nothing to lose but another's been broken  
I need you here  
I need you here  
Don't leave me here, will you stay for a moment  
Don't turn away 'cause you're scare you can't hold it  
You've nothing to lose but another's been broken  
I need you here
