Bad luck, is doggin' me around  
Bad luck, is doggin' me around  
And I can't change my ways  
Because I've been made second grade  
  
And it's better to have loved  
Loved and lost  
Yes it's better to have loved  
Loved and lost  
It's better to have loved and lost  
Than never to have loved at all.  
  
No love, has come to me and stayed  
No love, has come to me and stayed  
But I can't win this race  
But to try to run ain't no disgrace  
  
Losin' hands, have always been my deal  
Losin' hands, have always been my deal  
Never have drawn, drawn the ace  
But when trouble came  
I always looked it in the face.
