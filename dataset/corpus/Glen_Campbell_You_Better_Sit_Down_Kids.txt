You better sit down kids, I'll tell you why, kids  
You might not understand, kids but give it a try, kids  
Now how should I put this, I've got something to say  
Your mama is staying, but I'm goin' away  
No, we're not mad, kids and it's hard to say why  
Your mother and I, kids, don't see eye to eye  
  
Say your prayers before you go to bed  
Make sure you get yourself to school on time  
I know you'll do the things your mother asks  
She's gonna need you most to stay in line  
Keep in mind your mama's gonna need  
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before  
No more fightin' over little things 'cause  
I won't be here to stop them anymore  
  
I know you don't want this but neither do we  
But sometimes things happen that we can't foresee  
So try to be calm, kids and don't look so sad  
Just cause I am leavin', I'll still be your dad  
But just remember I love you and though I'm not here  
Just call if you need me, I'll always be near  
  
Say your prayers before you go to bed  
Make sure you get yourself to school on time  
I know you'll do the things your mother asks  
She's gonna need you most to stay in line  
Keep in mind your mother's gonna need  
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before  
No more fightin' over little things 'cause  
I won't be here to stop them anymore  
  
Well, I have to go now, So kiss me goodbye  
My eyes are just red, kids, I'm too big to cry
