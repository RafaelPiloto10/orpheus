Father dear, don't you hear me  
I'm alone, and I can't sleep from crying  
Father dear, well if you hear me  
I've been held closely by a stranger  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Listen, if you find him  
Won't you tell him just how much I love him  
Father, I've only got you  
Please, won't you make him love me too  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Sweet, sweet  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Father, hear me calling  
You're the only one I can turn to  
My life has been so empty  
And he could fill my emptiness too  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
Help me, help me
