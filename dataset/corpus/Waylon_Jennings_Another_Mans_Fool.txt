Don't sing them songs about the open road  
I lost too many rainbows chasing pots of gold  
I still remember what my baby said  
It's still a knockin' around in back of my head  
  
[Chorus]  
She said, I'm gonna lock the doors around about midnight  
Put bars on the window like a zoo  
You ain't the man that reaches up to turn out my light  
You're just another man's fool  
Just another man's fool  
  
I left this morning had just one more chance  
She caught me leaving by the seat of my pants  
She said go on get out and have a good time  
Don't bother coming home if you can't bring me mine  
  
[Chorus: x2]
