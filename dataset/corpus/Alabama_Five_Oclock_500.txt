Just punched the clock and boy, am I ready?  
Walkin' out the door headin' home  
It's time to buckle up again in my rolling hunk of tin  
It's quittin' time the evenin' race is on  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Oh, Bubba's runnin' right on my bumper  
Pushin' me but there's no where to go  
Lane changin' left and right, blowin' horns and blinkin' lights  
Oh, the fast lane has never been so slow  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Well, the caution is out we're at a stand still  
Heard there's construction up ahead  
Won't be long so they say, soon we'll all be on our way  
Some trucker on the CB just said  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500 every day  
Every day, every day, every day  
Five o'clock 500
