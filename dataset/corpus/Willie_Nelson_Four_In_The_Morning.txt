It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Woke up the wanting in me  
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget her  
How much better off she would be  
The longer that I hold on and the longer that it goes on the harder that it's
gonna be  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her  
That's the last thing I wanna do  
She knows but she can't tell how she feels but I know  
Too well what she's going through  
And if I love her so much I don't know why I can't do  
The right thing and just let her be  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her this time it's all over  
Making ten times I told her goodbye  
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up  
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her than most foolish men will ever
see  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Four in the morning once more the dawning just woke up the wanting in me
