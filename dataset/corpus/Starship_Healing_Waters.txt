When all the hope is gone, I'll be there to keep you strong  
I will lay your body down in healing waters  
Turn this darkness into light, help you stand, I'll help you fight  
But don't ever let them break your spirit  
  
And have faith, (A light will shine on you) and someday a light will shine on
you  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
I will lead you down to healing waters  
  
When you cry out to the moon, I'll be there beside you  
I won't let these shadows reach into your heart  
Raise up the spirit of kings, let the bells of freedom ring  
Don't ever let them put out this fire  
  
And have faith, (A light will shine on you) and someday a light will shine on
you  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
And have faith, (Oh have faith) and someday the sun will break on through  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
  
All your troubles, oh they will be over  
  
Don't ever let them break your spirit  
  
And have faith, (Oh have faith) and someday a light will shine on you  
And I will lay your body down in healing waters  
And have faith, and someday the sun will break on through  
And I will lay your body down in healing waters  
I will walk you down to healing waters  
  
All your troubles, they will be over, and we'll never ever, won't give up  
  
(Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)
