This is the daybreak  
And this is the love we make  
For love is the law here  
You got to know how I love it, yeah  
It's more than a mover  
You know it takes all fast, all song  
Stone cold wild  
Bring the love in son, brother, man  
True nature child  
I think I'll sing it  
  
For Atlanta Georgia  
To Longsight Manchester  
Everyone ready  
So, so willing and able, yeah, yeah, yeah  
For the love you make  
Go no sis, huh, yeah, woo  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She built it to make ya  
We all love makers, ain't we  
Sister Rosa Lee parks  
Love forever her name in your heart  
Forever in my heart  
  
Woo, hey  
As I sing on this song  
Someone just got rolled on  
Hey, oh hey, yeah, woo, yeah  
  
New York City to Addis Ababababa  
Keep on keeping strong  
Keep on keeping on  
  
So why no stack for black  
On a radio station in this, the city  
Been going on so long  
Level on the line, I'm a leaf on the vine of time  
Black bones are the original bones  
And so this is the whole wide world should know, y'all  
I came to sing this song in your city  
  
Ooh, for the dreamers  
One more for the dreamers, yeah
