Oh you shouldn't have kissed me and got me so excited  
And when you asked me out I really was delighted  
So we went to a pub in belsize park  
And we cheered on england as the sky grew dark  
Oh you shouldn't have kissed me cause you started a fire  
But then I found out that you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You never mentioned your three children  
And the fact you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
If you hadn't passed out while I was talking to your friend  
It could have really ended badly cause you very nearly had me  
If he hadn't taken pity on my heart full of desire  
I might never have found out you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You forgot you have three children  
You forgot you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
It is not in my nature to ever pick the winning team  
Sometimes I think I'm happy then I remember it's a dream  
Now it isn't in my nature to ever pick a winner  
I always pick a bastard who would have me for his dinner  
  
I can never possess the object of my desire  
Cause he's bound to turn out to be a serial liar  
Ok I didn't mention my kids, I thought I'd wait a bit  
But I am free and single and he's a lying git  
  
Cause he lied about his status  
He lied about his life  
He forgot he had three children  
He forgot he had a wife  
And it's england 2 colombia 0  
I know just how those colombians feel  
  
So I got into a taxi and sobbed all the way home  
Called my friend up in sao paulo and cried down the phone  
I played some tragic music and I lay down to die  
But later I woke and I hadn't stopped crying  
  
You should never have kissed me, you tasted of deceit  
Your perfume was adultery but I'm not a piece of meat  
So I'll be the one that you couldn't acquire  
I found out in time you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
And I pity your three children  
And I pity your poor wife  
Now you can go to hell  
I'm going to brazil  
Still it's england 2 colombia 0
