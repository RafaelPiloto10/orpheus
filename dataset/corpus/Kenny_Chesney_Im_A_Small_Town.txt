Well I've been around  
Since before the trains came through  
Well I've seen a lot  
But the first time my heart broke in two,  
Was when they brought those Johnson brothers back,  
To their momma with a flag  
  
Well I'm a small town  
  
There's hundreds just like me  
Yeah but I'm the one  
Well you happen to be  
When you learned how to ride your first bike  
Up and down my street  
Well you grew up  
And couldn't wait to just get out  
  
I'm a small town  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There ain't no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
I'm a small town  
Just a dot there on the map  
If you blink you miss me  
Yeah well go ahead and laugh  
But I'm where you kissed your first someone  
I'm where you hit your last home run  
I'm where you lay your grandpa in the ground  
  
Yeah, I'm a small town  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There ain't no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
I'm a small town  
  
You left in a cloud of dust  
Big city bound  
But I never once gave up  
And when you looked into that newborn angel's eyes  
And it occurred  
There was only one place good enough for here  
  
Where everyone knows everyone  
There ain't no secrets around here  
Sonny there you love me  
You hang me for everything I am  
Either I hold your heart  
Or I hold you down  
  
I'm a small town  
  
I'm a small town  
  
I'm a small town  
I'm a small town  
I'm a small town  
Yeah I'm a small town
