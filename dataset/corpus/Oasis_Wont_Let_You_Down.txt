No I won't, let you down  
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns  
Looks to me, they've had their day  
Think it's time that you came out and played  
  
What d'you say?  
It's time that you came out and played  
Won't you say?  
It's time that you came out and played  
  
Let's get out of our minds  
Won't waste your time  
Give it a try  
Won't waste your time  
  
No I won't, let you down  
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns  
Looks to me, they've had their day  
Think it's time that you came out and played  
  
What d'you say?  
It's time that you came out and played  
What d'you say?  
It's time that you came out and played  
  
Let's get out of our minds  
Don't waste your time  
Give it a try  
Open your mind  
  
Won't let you down  
Don't let me down  
Won't let you down  
Won't let you down
