I was heading down the highway  
She's going my way  
She climbed in, the next thing I knew  
  
We started laughing and smoking,  
We got to talking  
Yeah, we'd both been hurt a time or two  
  
I knew she didn't love me  
But I didn't think she'd want me, no  
Right there she took me  
Underneath that sun, we became one  
  
She said  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange  
A lot like you...  
(Let's ride)  
  
Halfway to Boston  
She turned down the radio  
Asked what I was looking for  
  
Then I looked in her eyes,  
For the first time I realized  
I really didn't know anymore  
  
Sometimes I think I want true love  
Most times I feel like there's no one  
But in the meantime hold me tight  
Things will be alright  
  
I said...  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange  
A lot like you...  
(Let's ride)  
  
I pulled along the highway  
The time had come to go our way  
She took my hand, looked into my eyes  
And said "won't you hold me one more time"  
  
She said...  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange a lot  
Oh baby, a lot like you...
