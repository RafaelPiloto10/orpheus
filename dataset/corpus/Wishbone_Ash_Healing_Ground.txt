They're telling me if I believe  
They'll pull the evil out of me  
Gonna set my spirit free  
Down at the healing ground  
Cure me with a snake bite  
Something ain't feeling right  
Blood in the moonlight  
Down at the healing ground  
Have I really gone this wrong?  
Do I really need a shot this strong?  
Can salvation be found  
Down at the healing ground?  
They don't know the shape I'm in  
Drowning in a sea of sin  
Will I die and be born again  
Down at the healing ground?
