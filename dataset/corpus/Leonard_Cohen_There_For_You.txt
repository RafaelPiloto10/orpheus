When it all went down  
And the pain came through  
I get it now  
I was there for you  
Don't ask me how  
I know it's true  
I get it now  
I was there for you  
I make my plans  
Like I always do  
But when I look back  
I was there for you  
I walk the streets  
Like I used to do  
And I freeze with fear  
But I'm there for you  
I see my life  
In full review  
It was never me  
It was always you  
You sent me here  
You sent me there  
Breaking things  
I can't repair  
Making objects  
Out of thoughts  
Making more  
By thinking not  
Eating food  
And drinking wine  
A body that  
I thought was mine  
Dressed as Arab  
Dressed as Jew  
O mask of iron  
I was there for you  
Moods of glory  
Moods so foul  
The world comes through  
A bloody towel  
And death is old  
But it's always new  
I freeze with fear  
And I'm there for you  
I see it clear  
I always knew  
It was never me  
I was there for you  
I was there for you  
My darling one  
And by your law  
It all was done
