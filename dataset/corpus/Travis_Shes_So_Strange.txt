She's so strange  
And she wore a black mustache  
And pilfered all the petty cash  
She went to Birmingham  
She'll soon be in the can  
  
She's so cruel  
And she knew what just what to do  
And while the cats were all sniffing glue  
They played their silly games  
And now they'll take the blame  
  
What she'd done  
And she didn't know quite what she did  
And they told her that she better had  
So now she starts to cry  
Without a reason why  
  
She's so poor  
And only now she's looking back  
Sees her story on a paperback  
What will become of her  
There's not much left for her
