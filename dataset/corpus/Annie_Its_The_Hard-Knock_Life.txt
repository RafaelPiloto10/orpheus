[ORPHANS]  
It's a hard-knock life for us!  
It's a hard-knock life for us!  
  
[ANNIE]  
'Stead of treated,  
[ORPHANS]  
We get tricked!  
  
[ANNIE]  
'Stead of kisses,  
  
[ORPHANS]  
We get kicked!  
  
[ALL]  
It's a hard-knock life!  
Got no folks to speak of, so,  
It's the hard-knock row we hoe  
  
[ANNIE]  
Cotton blankets (2 beats)  
  
[ORPHANS]  
'Stead a wool  
  
[ANNIE]  
Empty Bellies (2 beats)  
  
[ORPHANS]  
'Stead a full!  
  
[ALL]  
It's a hard-knock life!  
  
[ANNIE]  
Don't it feel like the wind is always howl'n?  
  
[KATE AND TESSIE]  
Don't it seem like there's never any light!  
  
[ANNIE and MOLLY]  
Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in?  
  
[PEPPER, JULY]  
It's easier than putting up a fight.  
  
[ANNIE]  
No one's there when your dreams at night are creepy!  
No one cares if you grow or if you shrink!  
No one dries when your eyes get wet and weepy  
  
[ALL]  
From the crying you would think this place's would sink!  
Ohhhh!  
Empty belly life!  
Rotten smelly life!  
Full of sorrow life!  
No tomorrow life!  
  
[MOLLY]  
Santa Claus we never see  
  
[ANNIE]  
Santa Claus, what's that?  
Who's he?  
  
[ALL]  
No one cares for you a smidge  
When your in an orphanage!  
It's the hard knock life  
  
[MOLLY]  
(Making a whistling sound and imitating Miss Hannigan)  
You're gonna scrub this dump till it shines  
Like the top of the Chrysler building.  
  
[ORPHANS (Except Molly)]  
Yank the whiskers from her face  
Jab her with a safety Pin  
Make her drink a Mickey Finn  
I love you Miss Hannigan  
(Molly)  
Get to work!  
Scrub the floors  
I said get to work!  
  
[ALL]  
It's the hard-knock life for her  
  
It's the hard-knock life for her  
No one cares for you a smidge  
(Molly)  
  
When your in an orphanage  
It's a hard-knock life!  
It's a hard-knock life!  
It's a hard-knock life!
