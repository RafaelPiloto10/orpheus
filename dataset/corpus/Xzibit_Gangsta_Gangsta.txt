Witness the downfall of men  
I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor  
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains  
March to the heart beat of the city  
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me  
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks  
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck  
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me  
Push all to shallow, forever  
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z  
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?  
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere  
Look how strong we are  
So there will be no war or shots  
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real  
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill  
Concentration, determination  
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration  
  
[Chorus]  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming  
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am  
  
They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace  
Then walk into the light  
My soul want me take it without a fight  
She says she wanna spend the whole life  
But she only got me here for one night  
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend  
I'm a call you wonder-twins  
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic  
We made it happen  
And big hip hop want us gut cut  
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up  
Another game fucked up, because the lanes clocked up  
But the content sucks  
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through  
The whole world, motherfuckers lining up  
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap  
You're tying west coast around my back  
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now  
Toast to the bad guys  
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes  
Part machine, part skill, part intuition  
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen  
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken  
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know  
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both  
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear  
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us  
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front  
Caught there, they try to tear me down  
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature  
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone  
Where you past, gangsta?  
  
[Chorus]
