Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You can see that I'm sorry  
For runnin' 'round with someone new  
But I know you don't mean it  
And mister till I think you do  
You can keep al your hugs  
Don't want your kisses  
You had to many tries  
And too many misses  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
If you think that I'm greedy  
For wanting you all to myself  
Well you're right, yes indeedy  
I won't share your love with no one else  
And if you think  
That your lies are gonna hurt me  
Well you just think again  
'Cause you don't know me  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You make me think everything is ok  
Then you go out and play the field  
And make me play the fool  
  
Go and say that you're sorry  
I can't live on apologies  
If you want all my loving  
Then there will have to be some guarantees  
Say you'll settle down and in addition  
Say that you'll eliminate the competition  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
This time I mean what I say  
Hey  
Nathaniel B Jackson
