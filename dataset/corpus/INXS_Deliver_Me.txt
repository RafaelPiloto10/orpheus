Deep down is a mystery  
All I want to know is why  
Your ways are taking over  
All the apple in my eye  
  
I'm in a crowded room  
Can't hear a single word they say  
They're just a darkened face  
I don't believe I know your name  
  
I smell ya - on my fingertips  
I hear ya - whispering  
I feel ya - all over me  
I'm never gonna be the same  
  
Watcha trying to do to me  
Is tell me the rules of the game (hey)  
Deliver me, from your spell  
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more of the same, yeah  
  
Deliver me  
Deliver me  
Deliver me  
Deliver me  
  
See watcha trying to do to me  
Is tell me the rules of the game  
Cause I'm just out of my skin  
When the phones and questions remain  
  
Deliver me, from your spell  
I give 'em, give 'em all of the same, yeah  
Deliver me, from your spell  
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more of the same, yeah
