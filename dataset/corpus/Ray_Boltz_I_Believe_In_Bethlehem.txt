I Believe In Bethlehem  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Chorus:  
I believe in Bethlehem  
Shining stars and making friends  
Peace on earth goodwill to men  
In all the world  
I believe in silent nights  
Gifts of love and guiding lights  
I believe it all began in Bethlehem  
In a city far away  
Lowly shepherds knelt to pray  
In a manager Jesus lay  
Shhhh sound asleep  
Angels singing in the sky  
Mother Mary at His side  
Precious gifts from far and wide  
At His feet  
I believe in Bethlehem  
Shining stars and making friends  
Peace on earth goodwill to men  
In all the world  
Chorus (repeat 2X)  
Peace on earth goodwill to men  
I believe it all began  
In a town called Bethlehem  
Bethlehem (I believe)  
It all began (I believe)  
In Bethlehem
