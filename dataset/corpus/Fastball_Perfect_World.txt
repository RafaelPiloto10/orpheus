You oughtta see you  
You're always bitchin' about something  
People wanna be you  
But they don't know ya like I do now  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
Open your eyes, and see the good things that you've got now  
Don't you realize that life is always sweet and sour  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
I know you think there's a conspiracy to keep you down  
It's all in your head  
You gotta learn to tune it out  
It's true, it's true  
It's all up to you  
You oughtta see you  
You're always bitchin' about something  
No one's gonna free you  
From the prison that you're buildin'  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
I know you think there's a conspiracy to keep you down  
It's all in your head  
You gotta learn to shut it out  
It's true, it's true  
It's all up to you  
Yeah, it's all up to you
