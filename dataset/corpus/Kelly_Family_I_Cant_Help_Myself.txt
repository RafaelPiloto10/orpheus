If I would tell you  
How much you mean to me,  
I think you wouldn't understand it  
So I wait I wait,  
Until' this day comes,  
When you will understand me  
  
But I can't help myself  
I can't stop myself  
I am going crazy  
And I can't stop myself  
I cannot control myself  
I am going crazy  
  
And I love you, I want you  
I want to talk to you,  
I want to be with you  
  
I cannot change it,  
I'm sure not making it  
One big hell of a fuss  
I cannot turn my back  
I've got to face the fact  
Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you...  
  
Kiss me, thrill me, don't say good bye  
Hug me, love me don't say goodbye  
Oh oh oh...  
And don't say goodbye  
  
And I can't help myself  
And I can't stop myself  
I am going crazy  
I cannot turn my back  
I've got to face the fact  
Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you...  
  
Oh uho uho oh, oh uho uho oh  
And kiss me goodbye
