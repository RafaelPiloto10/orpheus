If you've got trouble  
Then you've got less trouble than me  
You say you're worried  
You can't be as worried as me...ohh  
  
You're quite content to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
Just 'cause you're troubled  
Then don't bring your troubles to me  
  
And don't think it's funny  
When you ask for money for things  
Especially when you're standing there  
Wearing diamonds and rings...ohh  
  
You think I'm softning her head  
Well try someone softer instead anything  
It's not so funny  
When you know what money can bring  
You'd better leave me alone  
  
I don't need a thing from you  
You'd better take yourself home  
Go and count a ring or two  
If you've got trouble  
Then you've got less trouble than me  
  
You say you're worried  
You can't be as worried as me  
You're quite contempt to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
Just 'cause you're troubled  
Then don't bring your troubles to me  
  
You'd better leave me alone  
I don't need a thing from you  
You'd better take yourself home  
Go and count a ring or two  
If you've got trouble  
Then you've got less trouble than me  
  
You say you're worried  
You can't be as worried as me  
You're quite contempt to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
  
Just 'cause you're troubled  
Then don't bring your troubles to me  
Just 'cause your troubled  
Then don't bring your troubles to me
