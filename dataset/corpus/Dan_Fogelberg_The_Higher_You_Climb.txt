The higher you climb,  
The more that you see.  
The more that you see,  
The less that you know.  
The less that you know,  
The more that you yearn.  
The more that you yearn,  
The higher you climb.  
  
The farther you reach,  
The more that you touch.  
The more that you touch,  
The fuller you feel.  
The fuller you feel,  
The less that you need.  
The less that you need,  
The farther you reach.  
  
The higher you climb,  
The more that you see.  
The more that you see,  
The less that you know.  
The less that you know,  
The more that you yearn.  
The more that you yearn,  
The higher you climb.  
  
The higher you climb,  
The more that you see.  
The more that you see,  
The less that you know.  
The less that you know,  
The more that you yearn.  
The more that you yearn,  
The higher you climb.
