Oh, hey, y'all  
This is brother Ray  
I got something I wanna  
Talk to you about  
  
I'm tired of running  
From town to town  
Now I'm ready to stop, y'all  
And settle down  
  
Cause it's a life of misery  
When you're alone  
And I've got to have somebody  
To call my own  
  
Oh, baby, let me love you  
Whoa, baby, I wanna love you  
I need to love you, girl  
  
I'll be your water  
When your well goes dry  
And your good loving man, honey  
Til the day I die  
  
I'll be your shelter, yes, I will  
Whenever it rains  
And like Dr. Feelgood  
I can ease your pain  
  
Hey, baby, I wanna love you  
Whoa, baby  
I've got to love you, girl  
I need to love you  
  
Listen here  
I need you and want you  
So come on, girl  
Let's find some happiness  
In this old world  
  
Lord knows I'm gonna carry you  
Baby, by myself  
I've got to have you  
And nobody else  
  
Oh, baby, I wanna love you  
Whoa, baby  
I need to love you, girl  
I've got to love you  
  
Now come here, baby  
Why don't you hold my hand  
You know I'm gonna do  
The very best I can  
  
Lord knows I need you  
Right by my side, girl  
With love and affection  
To keep me satisfied  
  
Oh, Lord, I'm tired of running  
From town to town  
That's why I want you, girl  
To help me settle down  
  
Whoa, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, baby, looking so good...
