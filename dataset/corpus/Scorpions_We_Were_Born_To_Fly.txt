Hello again  
You've been alone awhile  
And I can use a friend  
Your shades are down  
And I've been waiting here for you to come around  
And it's not about forgiveness  
Cause it's all about the love anyhow  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
  
Take another breath  
Just close your eyes my love let nature do the rest  
Open up your wings  
And with the wind we'll rise above to higher things  
We'll forget about tomorrow  
And we'll live another day today  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly
