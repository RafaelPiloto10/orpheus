We're on our own, cousin,  
All alone, cousin.  
Let's think of a game to play  
Now the grown-ups have all gone away.  
You won't be much fun  
Being blind, deaf and dumb.  
But I've no-one to play with today.  
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?  
To find me it would take you a week,  
But tied to that chair  
You won't go anywhere  
There's a lot I can do with a freak.  
How would you feel if I  
Turned on the bath,  
Ducked your head under  
And started to laugh?  
What would you do if I shut you outside,  
To stand in the rain  
And catch cold so you died?  
  
I'm the school bully!  
The classroom cheat.  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet.  
I'll stick pins in your fingers  
And tread on your feet...  
  
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm  
Would change your expression  
To one of alarm.  
I'll drag you round by a lock of your hair  
Or give you a push  
At the top of the stairs...  
  
I'm the school bully!  
The classroom cheat.  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet.  
I'll put glass in your dinner  
And spikes in your seat...
