[Verse 1]  
The first noel, the angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep  
  
[Chorus]  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!  
  
[Verse 2]  
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The star drew night to the northwest  
Over Bethlehem it took its rest  
And there it did both stop and stay  
Right over the place where Jesus lay  
  
[Chorus x2]
