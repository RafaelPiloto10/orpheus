Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
I'm calling but I can't get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
I'm searching for the lover that I knew  
Have you see her  
Where did she go  
Feels like I just lost my only friend  
  
Plains subsided colors faded  
Love just got so complicated  
Wished that I could see her smile again  
  
So if you see her out there  
Tell her I'm still here  
Waiting for the date when she will reappear  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
I'm calling but I can't get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Maybe I was wrong and I  
Ignored her for too long and I  
Didn't even notice when she slipped away  
  
Oh, maybe while I lay fast asleep  
When out into the night she creeps  
I'll leave the light on  
So she will come back someday  
  
Oh, if you see her out there  
Tell her its not fair  
And the life just not the same when she's not here  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what I'm suppose to do  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh woo, oh,  
Oh woo  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what I'm suppose to do  
  
Oh, please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh get back soon
