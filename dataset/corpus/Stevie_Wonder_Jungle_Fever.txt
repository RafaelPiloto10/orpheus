I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy  
We're each other's baby, we're in love  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
  
She can't love me, I can't love her  
Cause they say we're the wrong color  
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking  
Like we've done something wrong  
Because we show love strong, get real, come on  
Calling us names too bad to mention  
But we pay them no attention  
For color blind are inner feelings  
If we feel happiness  
And know our love's the best, forget their mess  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy  
We're each other's baby, we're in love  
  
Everyone's created equal  
Hell with all you ignorant people  
Trying to stereo type us  
You really ought to quit  
Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick  
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me  
Because I got my girl beside me  
You'll only make yourself look stupid  
I love you're trying to dis  
Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy  
We're each other's baby, we're in love  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy  
We're each other's baby, we're in love
