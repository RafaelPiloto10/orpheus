There, there, there, there,  
Put aside the everyday world and come with us  
Into the realm of imagination  
The middle ground between light and shadow  
U-N-K-L-E  
  
Would've ordinarily unveiled themselves as a guarantee of anonymity  
But could include among other notable figures, .  
DJ Shadow and James Lavelle  
Keep on rockin, keep on rock, rock, rock, keep on rockin  
Keep-keep-keep on rock, K-L-E, keep on, .K-L-E  
Keep on, L-E, L-E, rockin'  
  
You-N-K-L-E, you-N-K, you-N-K, you-N-K-K-L-L-E  
It's the awesome eternal Unkle word-word-word, .word  
Science fiction, science, science fiction, science fiction  
Fiction, fiction, science, science fict- bio breaker  
An adventure unlike anything on your planet  
  
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on  
Keep keep on rockin'  
Keep keep in keep keep keep in keep keep on keep keep in keep on  
Keep on keep keep keep on rockin'  
Keep on you keep on N keep on K keep on L keep on E  
Keep on rockin' E  
U (U-N) N (L-L-L) K-L-E,  
There were too many of us  
We had access to too many, uh, too much money  
Too much equipment, and little by little we went insane  
Fiery the angels fell, burning in the fires of Orc  
  
You-N-K-L-E, you-N-K, you-N-K, you-N-K-K-L-L-E  
A ticket to nothingness,  
Unkle
