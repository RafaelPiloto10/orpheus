They judge you by your money  
Or the color of your skin  
They read you by the cover  
Don't take time to read within  
  
They judge you without jury  
And you struggle to believe  
No one could hear your story  
Even justice had to leave  
All I know  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
They build the walls around you  
They tell you, you don't fit  
Still you think you know me  
You don't know the half of it  
  
I'm a beggar, you're a savior  
I'm your devil, you're a thief  
I'll be here until you realize  
I'm you and you are me  
  
All that I know  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
Do the cuts bleed any different  
On a pauper or a king?  
When it comes down to dyin'  
The crown don't mean a thing, no, no, no, no  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone
