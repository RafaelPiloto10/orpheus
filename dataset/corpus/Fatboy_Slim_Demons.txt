They say she had a heart attack  
I think the preacher's coming back  
And I'm frying 'cause all my love's electrifying  
  
And I'm comfy like a cesspool  
want to be with you  
And it's my premonition  
I better give my heart a listen  
And my preacher say  
  
All of your demons will wither away  
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay  
You'll understand when you come my way  
'Cause all of my demons have withered away  
  
They said he shook himself to death  
I want to dance 'til my last breath  
But mister disco only parties hard in Frisco  
  
And I'm comfy like a cesspool  
want to be with you  
And it's my premonition  
I better give my heart a listen  
And my preacher say  
  
All of your demons will wither away  
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay  
You'll understand when you come my way  
'Cause all of my demons have withered away
