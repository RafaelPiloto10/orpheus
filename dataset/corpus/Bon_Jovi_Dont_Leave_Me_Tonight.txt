If I had to I would lie for you,  
And baby I would cry, I'd cry for you.  
If I have to, I'll get down on my knees for you.  
  
Tommy's home and waiting up for you,  
And it you leave, he'll make you black and blue.  
Please don't go, not this time,  
Oh no don't leave me tonight.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
If you only knew what you put me through,  
And how many night I've waited up for you.  
Thinkin' about you baby every night,  
Now you're here and you've gotta go home.  
  
We can hide out and rendezvous,  
Just me and just you.  
So please baby please, don't put up a fight,  
Oh no don't leave me tonight.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
Don't leave me tonight (oh baby not tonight)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it this time)  
Don't leave me tonight (Oh no no no)  
  
He don't love you half as much as I do,  
Promise you'll stay the night, and love me too.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
  
I can't stand another night alone,  
Or talkin' to you on the phone.  
So tell 'em that we're runnin' away,  
Tell 'em anything you want.  
Please stay now, don't say you'll go.  
  
Don't leave me tonight,  
Everything's gonna be alright.  
I need you girl, I need you to stay,  
Don't turn your back and walk away.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
Don't leave me tonight (everything will be alright)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can tell you I love you)  
Don't leave me tonight (I'm goin' outa my mind I  
Can't stand the nights alone).  
  
Don't leave me tonight (So baby don't say you're goin')  
Don't leave me tonight (Oh baby stay around)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it, can't take it,  
Can't take it, can't  
Take it without you, so baby please hang on).
