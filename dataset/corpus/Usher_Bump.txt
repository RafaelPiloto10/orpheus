[Intro: Lil Jon]  
At-at what, at-at-at what  
At-at-at what, at don't stop, don't stop  
At-at what, at-at-at, what  
At-at-at what, at don't stop, don't stop  
  
[Chorus: Usher]  
I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going)  
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to  
I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going)  
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to  
[Bridge: Usher]  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 1: Usher]  
She hit me with that killer  
She make me sling that skrilla  
Body tight for the summer  
Get it, get it for the winter  
Real player niggas  
Need something they can lay on  
That shit on my mind  
I need something to spend my day on  
And I love her like my niggas, my niggas, my niggas  
She ain't 'bout my feelings, my feelings, my feelings  
And I can't live by these hoes  
Cause she the one I chose  
Got the keys to the Benz  
I don't even drive my shit no more  
And let us just  
  
[Bridge: Usher]  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
  
[Chorus: Usher]  
I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going)  
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to  
I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going)  
And I don't know what to call this  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to, I'm ready to  
  
[Bridge: Usher]  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
  
[Verse 2: Usher]  
I know you feel me getting ready  
Cause you're all that's on my mind  
Tonight's champagne and confetti  
If you want, I'll stand in line  
For a little loving  
For a little bumping  
I hope that you hear what I'm sayin'  
I'm hopin' and prayin', I'll say it again  
  
[Chorus: Usher]  
I don't know where we going  
And I don't know what to call this  
And I don't know how it started  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to  
I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going)  
And I don't know what to call this (I don't know what to call this)  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (ready to)  
  
[Outro]  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
(Don't stop get it, get it)  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump  
Baby, yeah  
Oohhh
