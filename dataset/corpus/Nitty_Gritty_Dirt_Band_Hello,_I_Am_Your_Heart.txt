Hello, I am your heart  
And you got me broken one too many times  
Oh, hello, this is your heart speaking  
And you got me hurt boy one too many times  
  
Going away on a little vacation  
I'll be gone quite a while  
You won't have you no love making  
You'll just have that ten cent smile  
Goodbye, this is your heart leaving  
I wish you the best of luck  
While I'm healing up  
  
Oh hello this is your heart  
I just telephoned to see how you're getting by  
Oh hello this is your heart calling  
Well, I've got to run now but I'll drop you a line  
  
I'm having fun on my little vacation  
I may be gone a while  
You won't have you no love making  
You'll just have that ten cent smile  
Hello this is your heart  
I wish you the best of luck  
While I'm healing up  
  
Oh goodbye  
Goodbye
