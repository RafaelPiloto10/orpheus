Well, here comes my little baby  
Here comes my turtle dove  
She drives me crazy  
She's the one that I love  
  
She's got a way about her  
I could never turn down  
I couldn't live without her  
She makes the world go around  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine  
  
She's my little angel  
My little beauty queen  
She never met a stranger  
She's the girl of my dreams  
  
She's a ballerina  
Sweet as she can be  
Ought to see the way  
She's smilin' at me  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine
