Wrench is just a household god but I carry mine with pride  
I don't work but I can work with it to split your smile  
Run you down without a twitch your car's just not as big as mine  
Tear the son out of your bitch and sprinkle your remains with lime  
I ain't no workin' man I do the best I can I got the devil's hand rollin'
sixes  
I am the habit man I use up all I can I got the slacker's hand  
My afternoon's remote control, daydream milk and genocide  
Tranquility with broken knees, silly putty enemies  
Butter knife in your side  
What I got I got for free, middle finger technology  
What's yours is mine, yours is mine, told you fucker, yours is mine  
Snake eyes for sissies  
I am the pedophiles dream, a messianic peter pan  
Just a boy, just a boy, just a little fucking boy, I can never be a man
