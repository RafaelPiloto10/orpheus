What would you do if you knew how I was feelin'  
I wonder what you'd have to say  
Afraid of the answers I'm not takin' any chances  
I don't want to scare you away  
Oh, so I lie  
(I lie)  
Oh, yes I lie  
(I lie)  
Ooh, I don't wanna let you go  
I don't wanna let you know so I lie  
Here in my heart I can hold on to this secret  
I'm hopin' that you won't see through  
I don't like denyin' all the love that I've been hidin'  
I don't want to tell you the truth  
Oh, so I lie  
(I lie)  
Oh, yes I lie  
(I lie)  
Ooh, I don't wanna let you know  
I don't wanna let you go so I lie  
It's not easy to deceive you  
It's so hard to keep from saying I love you  
Oh, so I lie  
(I lie)  
Oh, yes I lie  
(I lie)  
Ooh, I don't wanna let you know  
I don't wanna let you go so I lie  
(I lie)  
Oh, yes I lie
