You know it never meant much to me  
But there's something on your mind that I could see  
It didn't hurt me too much to find  
You were seeing someone else for all of this time  
You know that I don't care  
And I like you to know that I don't care  
I don't need your sympathy  
Why don't you ever look at me?  
  
[Chorus]  
You did nothing for me  
You did nothing I see  
You did nothing for me  
You did nothing  
  
There's no today and there's no tomorrow  
Where you find sadness, I find sorrow  
Nobody knows, but it always shows  
I think I'm losing my mind, but that's the way that it goes  
And it's fine, all those lies  
I can see their truth lies in your eyes  
So I guess we are through  
You did to me what I did to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
[La, la, la, etc. omitted]  
I don't need your sympathy  
'Cause you don't mean that much to me  
  
[Chorus:]
