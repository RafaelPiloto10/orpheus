I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather  
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather  
Last of the red hot loving MC's  
Looking for a little, that's my theory  
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting  
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting  
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking, learning, the one you're liking  
Listen and you will love what I'm writing  
Ladies love, long, hard and lean  
And now you know what L.L. means  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get ill!  
Come on now  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
  
Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the land's highest law  
The man of the brand, one you look out for  
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last, leader of the class, see  
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's  
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E  
I bust your lip, my level won't slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip  
Come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref  
When I die, there will be no lovers left  
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer  
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter  
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud  
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love, the man you dream of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever lost, not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro  
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand  
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list  
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless  
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn  
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: x2]
