Well know it ain't much  
But it's all that I have since she's gone  
One black and white mem'ry  
Of the only love I've ever known  
One moment in time  
When we were together  
A page from the past  
To haunt me forever  
A constant reminder that hearts heal much slower than bones  
Chorus:  
Now my whole world's in one 8x10  
With 4 metal walls holding it in  
Through one plate glass window  
'neath a blanket of dust  
Stands an 8x10 picture of us  
I wish I'd have told her what I felt inside  
Back when her sweet love was growing like wine  
I wish she'd come back and love me again  
The way that she loved me in that old 8x10  
Now the silence I deaf'ning  
As the date turns to dark  
Her presence gets stronger with each beat of my heart  
I pretned that she's here  
And we've made a new start  
And for a moment  
She's back in my arms  
[Chorus:]  
There's an 8x10 picture of us
