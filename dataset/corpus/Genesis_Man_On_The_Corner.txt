See the lonely man there on the corner,  
What he's waiting for, I don't know.  
But he waits every day now.  
He's just waiting for something to show.  
  
And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,  
Cause there's no hidin' place,  
There's no hidin' place  
For you.  
  
Lookin' everywhere at no one,  
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh.  
When he shouts, nobody listens,  
Where he leads, no one will go, oh.  
  
He's a lonely man there on the corner.  
What he's waiting for, I don't know.  
But he waits every day now.  
He's just waiting for something to show.  
  
And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,  
Cause there's no hidin' place,  
There's no hidin' place  
For you and me.  
  
Are we just like all the rest?  
We're lookin' too hard for somethin' he's got  
Or movin' too fast to rest.  
But like a monkey on your back, you need it.  
But do you love it enough to leave it all?  
  
Just like the lonely man there on the corner,  
What he's waiting for, I don't know.  
But he waits every day now,  
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show.
