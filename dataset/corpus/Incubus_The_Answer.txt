(Mm, hemp?)  
Step outside the bounds and take a  
Big look at the times we live in.  
Who appointed you?  
You're just an avid image on my screen.  
So take your bias point of view away from  
My organic institution.  
And now we D.A.R.E. to think ourselves!  
The answer's waiting content.  
(Look into your mind and guide.)  
The answer's clear as day open your eyes!  
  
Now kill me.  
You killed the very thing that keeps us  
Hanging on to our dear lives.  
So, in a sense you bit the hand that feeds us  
Just to kill your prophet now.  
And with the coming generation at the torn seems  
This is what you call progress  
  
I call it shame!  
The answer's waiting content.  
(Look into your mind and guide.)  
The answers clear as day open your eyes!  
  
Now kill me.  
What his law says.  
What his law says.  
What his law says may not be the stepping stone for you!  
You killed the very thing that keeps us hanging on to our dear lives!
