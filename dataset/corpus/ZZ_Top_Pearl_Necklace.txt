She's really upset with me again,  
I didn't give her what she likes.  
I don't know what to tell her,  
Don't know what to say.  
Everything got funky last night.  
  
She was really bombed,  
And I was really blown away,  
Until I asked her what she wanted,  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
  
She gets a charge out of bein' so weird,  
Digs gettin' downright strange.  
But I can keep a handle on anything,  
Just this side of deranged.  
  
She was gettin' bombed,  
And I was gettin' blown away,  
And she held it in her hand  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
  
She is so tough, as pure as the driven slush.  
And that's not true what she's talkin' about,  
It really don't cost that much.  
  
She was gettin' bombed,  
And I was gettin' blown away,  
And she took it in her hand,  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.
