Everybody get into the mood  
Forget your troubles for a little while  
All together let me see you move  
Aeach individual in a different style  
Come old lady there's no need to hide  
Just feel the rhythm and enyoy ride  
Shake it baby up and down your spine  
Couse once you're dancing you'll be feeling fine  
  
If I can do it you can do it too  
You got in you that I promise you  
You're gonna show that you're a little star tonight  
  
Chorus  
We'll take it easy wel'll take it slow  
We're gonna dance to the rock 'n roll  
We'll take it easy we'll take it slow  
We're gonna dance to the rock 'n roll  
  
Little babies are dancin'to the tune  
Well mama an'papa like the rhythm too  
Shake it baby give it one more try  
Cause there's no reason for you to be shy  
  
If I can do it you can do it too  
You're gonna show that you're al little star  
Tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
If you're ugly or pretty  
Or chubby or skinny  
It don't matter you'll be  
Having a good time  
The old will be longer  
And the young will be older  
We're all gonna dance through the night  
Aaah... Aaah... Aaah... Aaah
