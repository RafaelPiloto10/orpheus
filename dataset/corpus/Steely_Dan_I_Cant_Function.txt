I'm working hard from morning 'til night  
My shoulder bent into the wheel  
I get home, you start to run me down  
How do you think it makes me feel?  
Your lashing turn  
It hurts my soul  
I start to think  
And I lose control  
I'm not moving like I know I should  
Or feeling like I'd like to feel  
And I spend my days just fooling around  
I can't function,  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
I gotta make a little fortune  
So I can bring it on home to you  
You're only hurting yourself my friend  
Treating me the way you do  
My hands are tied behind my back  
I'm drinking dinner from a paper sack  
Every day is the Fourth of July  
And I'm nothing but an April Fool  
Well I spend my days just cruising around  
I can't function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
I'm half a man  
With half a heart  
I hear you laughing  
And I fall apart  
I'd like to put it on the table  
But I'm lost before I even start  
You do me wrong and it's bringing me down  
My idle ways are the talk of the town  
You make me feel like a do-nothing-clown  
I can't function  
Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
.........  
[Background talk..  
Don't you run me down darling  
... In public! .....]
