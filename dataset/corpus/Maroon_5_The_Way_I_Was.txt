Making love to a picture frame  
One more time tonight  
You can tell by the lines in her smile  
Something is not right  
  
Where are you hiding (hiding)  
She's on the outside  
I'm on the inside crying (crying)  
Just another crazy boy  
Hungry for your  
  
[Chorus]  
Hot love  
Wrap yourself around me like a  
Warm glove  
The emptiness leaves me and I'm  
Filled up  
Never need to  
Go back to the way I was  
The way I was  
  
I tried and tried and tried and tried  
But I have no concept of consequence  
And I'm a master of self defense  
Days get longer  
Life gets shorter  
She rips me like no other  
So oh dripping from head to toe  
  
Where are you hiding (hiding)  
She's on the outside  
I'm on the inside crying (crying)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I can't make the same mistake  
If you lose my love  
It was yours to take  
Break down your door  
Take a little more  
When I need you around  
  
And I'm so terrified of leaving  
It's a new low  
Try and pick me up again but  
Let go see how far I get without you  
Desperately need more of your  
  
[Chorus: x2]
