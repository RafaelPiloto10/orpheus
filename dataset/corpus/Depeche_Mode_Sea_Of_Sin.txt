Sea of sin  
I'm swimming in  
And I'm taking a dive  
My mind's in need  
So my body feeds  
And it keeps me alive  
It gets better and better  
As it gets wetter and wetter  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
But I don't care  
  
Sea of sin  
Through thick and thin  
For better or worse  
My mind's in need  
So my body feeds  
And it quenches my thirst  
You look cheaper and cheaper  
As we sink deeper and deeper  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
'Cause I've been there  
  
Here under God's sky  
His watchful eye  
And all of the lies  
My consolation prize  
  
Sea of sin  
My second skin  
My home from home  
When I'm in doubt  
My hands reach out  
And I'm never alone  
It gets wetter and wetter  
As it gets better and better  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I'm prepared  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
Yes I'm aware  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
'Cause I've been there  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I don't care  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I don't care
