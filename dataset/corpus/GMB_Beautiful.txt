You hold the pieces in me  
Made me all complete  
You placed your love within me  
Made my hope complete  
  
And now my heart is thankful  
For your grace in me  
And I can't wait to tell the world  
Exactly how I feel about my god  
  
Chorus:  
You are all I need  
Your love brings out the best in me  
All I can say is beautiful  
You're beautiful to me  
  
And now that I am free  
To be all you want me to be  
I'll tell the world you're beautiful  
So beautiful to me
