Someday, someway you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, you're going to need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
Go on, go on til you reach the end of the line  
Cause I know you'll pass my way again  
Its just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had  
  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
Remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love is a true love  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Words are spoken with chords played  
Someday and someway  
Girl you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, I know you gonna need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Continue singing here  
After I gave you everything I had  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
But remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
  
That my love was a true love  
Its just a matter of time
