All my stars are upside down  
And you're there when I turn around  
I don't wanna be on my own  
And I don't wanna bring you down  
I just can't figure out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
When you touch down, remember this  
The more you leave behind  
The more I miss  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
And I don't wanna wake alone  
I just can't work it out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
Did you have to go, I don't wanna see you leave  
What good of memories, distance stretch further with the time  
Every time I close my eyes, you're fight off the sunrise  
Now we're voices down the line, tell me, tell me why  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello, when you're gone  
So long, I don't know  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When there's heaven in hello  
I'll never know why you have to go
