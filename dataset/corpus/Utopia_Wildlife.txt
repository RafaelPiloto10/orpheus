Mommy told me she has everything I want  
Mommy told me that I should not worry 'bout nothing else  
Mommy told me that I can't do what I want  
Mommy told me  
But she's only thinking about herself  
Can  
I'm thinking about myself  
Time to leave and it's just as well  
'Cause I can't help thinking there's something else  
Wildlife  
So I told he that I must have something more than she offered  
And she should not worry about my health  
I'm a big boy, not her little boy no more  
I'm a big boy and I must learn how to protect myself  
Hold my own when they give me hell  
She can worry about herself  
Tiny eagles must leave their nest  
Wild horses withstand the test  
Old lovers become estranged  
Little boys who can't help but change  
Could be nothing but who can tell
