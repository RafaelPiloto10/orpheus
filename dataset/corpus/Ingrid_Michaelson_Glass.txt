Rolled around on kitchen floors  
Tied my tongue in pretty bows with yours  
And now we pass and just like glass  
I see through you, you see through me like I'm not there  
  
You could make my head swerve  
Used to know my every curve  
And now we meet on a street,  
And I am blind, I can not find the heart I gave to you  
  
Sometimes what we think we really want we don't  
Sometimes what we think we want we really don't  
Sometimes what we think we love we don't  
  
And I am blind. I can not find the heart I gave to you  
And when we meet on a street,  
Then I am blind, I can not find the heart I gave to you
