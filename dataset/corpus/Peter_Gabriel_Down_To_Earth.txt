Did you think that your feet had been bound  
By what gravity brings to the ground?  
Did you feel you were tricked  
By the future you picked?  
Well, come on down  
  
All those rules don't apply  
When you're high in the sky  
So, come on down  
Come on down  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
There's no better place to go  
We've got snow up on the mountains  
We've got rivers down below  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
We hear the birds sing in the trees  
And the land will be looked after  
We send the seeds out in the breeze  
  
Did you think you'd escaped from routine  
By changing the script and the scene?  
Despite all you made of it  
You're always afraid  
Of the change  
  
You've got a lot on your chest  
Well, you can come as my guest  
So come on down  
Come on down  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
There's no better place to go  
We've got snow up on the mountains  
We've got rivers down below  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
We hear the birds sing in the trees  
And the land will be looked after  
We send the seeds out in the breeze  
  
Like the fish in the ocean  
We felt at home in the sea  
We learned to live off the good land  
We learned to climb up a tree  
Then we got up on two legs  
But we wanted to fly  
When we messed up our homeland  
We set sail for the sky  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
There's no better place to go  
We've got snow up on the mountains  
We've got rivers down below  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
We hear the birds sing in the trees  
And the land will be looked after  
We send the seeds out in the breeze  
  
We're coming down(down)  
Coming down to Earth (down)  
Like babies at birth (down)  
Coming down to Earth (down to the earth)  
We're gonna find new priorities (down)  
These are extraordinary qualities (down)  
  
Down down to earth  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
There's no better place to go (down to earth)  
We've got snow up on the mountains  
We've got rivers down below  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
We hear the birds sing in the trees  
And the land will be looked after  
We send the seeds out in the breeze  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
There's no better place to go  
We've got snow up on the mountains  
We've got rivers down below  
  
We're coming down to the ground  
We hear the birds sing in the trees  
And the land will be looked after  
We send the seeds out in the breeze  
  
We're gonna find new priorities  
These are extraordinary qualities
