Should have been, could have been  
Would have been dead  
If I didn't get the message  
Goin' to my head  
I am what I am  
Most motherfuckers  
Don't give a damn  
Oh baby think you can  
Be my girl, I'll be your man  
  
Someone full of fun  
Do me 'till I'm well done  
Little Bo Peep  
Cumin' from my stun gun  
Beware take care  
Most motherfuckers  
Have a cold ass stare  
Aw baby please be there  
Suck my kiss cut me my share  
  
Hit me you can't hurt me suck my kiss  
Kiss me please pervert me stick with this  
Is she talking dirty  
Give to me sweet sacred bliss  
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss  
  
Look at me can't you see  
All I really want to be  
Is free from a world  
That hurts me  
I need relief  
Do you want me girl  
To be your thief  
Aw baby just for you

Swimming in the sound

Kiss me please pervert me stick with this

Most motherfuckers  
Don't give a damn  
Oh baby think you can  
Be my girl, I'll be your man
