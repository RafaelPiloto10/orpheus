(The double dee double di)  
  
[Chorus]  
My lips like sugar, my lips like sugar  
This candy got you sprung, this candy got you sprung  
So call me your sugar, so call me your sugar  
You love you some, you love you some

Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities.  
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me.  
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone.  
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency.  
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss.  
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off.  
Put my tongue in your face  
A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier I'm a fan all day.  
Do me that favor, cause I like your flavor.  
My manage behavior, I'm into your major.  
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player.  
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager.  
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush.  
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush.  
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch,  
Shawty that's what's up.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, Sh Shawty would you mind, cause I want me some.  
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one.  
Yep! Yep! Your vision, so, so delicious.  
Can't help my interest, candy addiction.  
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece.  
I don't know a piece, give me all your sweets.  
Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast.  
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast.  
Man for them things, all 42 teeth.  
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat.  
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree.  
Like taffy but classy, get at me.  
I'm fly let you know I wanna kiss.  
But your lips, they'll do me fine.  
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind.  
Get, get on the grip, girl you ain't lyin'.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You like my sugar, my sugar you so sweet, so sweet.  
Like my candy, my candy you so sweet, so sweet.  
I got a good appetite with you on me, on me.  
I'll wrap you out of them clothes.  
You my treat, my treat.  
Girl you my sugar, I call you candy  
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some.  
Girl you my sugar, I call you candy  
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some sugar.  
  
[Chorus]
