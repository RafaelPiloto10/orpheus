Sky is clear tonight  
Sky is clear tomorrow  
A star is out  
I reach for one to sparkle in my hand  
A star is out  
I will not touch you, I am just a man  
  
Sky is clear tonight  
Sky is clear tomorrow  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
So I don't have to see the light  
Shining so bright  
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky  
  
"Man was born to love  
Though often he has sought  
Like Icarus, to fly too high.  
And far too lonely than he ought  
To kiss the sum of east and west  
And hold the world at his behest  
To hold the terrible power  
To whom only gods are blessed  
But me, I am just a man"  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
So I don't have to see the light  
Shining so bright  
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
But now I've got them open wide  
You've fallen into my hands  
And now you're burning me  
You're burning me
