If I had shown what you really meant to me  
Maybe then you'd still be a part of me  
I was wrong not to let you know  
This feeling that's hard for me to show  
  
Since you've gone I've always been alone  
Feeling down and sorry for myself  
I look at your picture and there I find  
I won't make it through another rain  
Without your sunshine  
  
I need you back...  
I need you here to guide me  
Please come back  
You're the only one who's ever loved me  
I need you back...  
Let's start all over again  
Share the love you had for me then  
  
Since I've said what I came here to say  
Guess I'd better be going on my way  
But before I go I just got to let you know  
You're the only one who can make me happy again  
  
I need you back...  
I need you here to guide me  
Please come back  
You're the only one who's ever loved me  
I need you back...  
Let's start all over again  
Share the love you had for me then  
  
Share the love you had for me then...
