I can't carry on  
This play is too long  
I must be going  
Extend my regrets  
  
I gave it my best  
But now I'm going  
This is too much for me to take  
Something tells me that she's faking it  
  
She says she don't care  
She wants to be fair  
She must be joking  
It's simple she said  
  
Let's not lose our head  
Tell me she's joking  
This is too much for me to take  
But somebody isn't faking  
  
Someone's heart is breaking  
And if you see her give her my critique  
She's a bad little actress  
Gets no curtain call  
  
But the worst of all  
When the curtain falls  
There's no one at the backstage door  
I'm more than her friend  
  
'Cause I knew her when  
She was no sensation  
She's wasting our time  
Repeats all her lines  
  
What's her motivation?  
Now she won't share her stage with me  
Her performance was outrageous  
Put me through some changes  
  
So if you see her give her my critique  
She's a bad little actress  
Her delivery don't come naturally  
Anyone could see she doesn't mean a word she says  
  
Her mascara ran  
And the show was panned  
But I'm still her biggest fan  
So when you see her give her my critique  
  
She's a bad little actress  
Gets no curtain call  
But the worst of all  
When the curtain falls  
There's no one at the backstage door
