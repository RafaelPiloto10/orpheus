Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around  
  
Do you feel what I feel  
Can we make it so that's part of the deal  
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel  
Lay your heart on the line this time  
  
I want to breathe when you breathe  
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze  
Count the beads of sweat that cover me  
Didn't you show me a sign this time  
  
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around, around  
  
Do you feel what I feel  
Do you feel what I feel  
Ah can you see what I see  
Can you cut behind the mystery  
I will meet you by the witness tree  
Leave the whole world behind  
  
I want to come when you call  
I'll get to you if I have to crawl  
They can't hold me with these iron walls  
We got mountains to climb, to climb  
  
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around
