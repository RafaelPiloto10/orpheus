I'll never cut my hair  
I'll never shed my skin  
I won't give in  
'cause that's the original sin  
  
Now I Know I don't belong  
Can't do right if I can't be wrong  
You won't catch me  
SInging the same old song  
No you won't  
  
Ask me no questions  
And I'll tell you no lies  
I never say never  
Yeah, I never say die  
  
Don't push me to the limit  
Wouldn't want to be in your place  
Better look out  
'Cause the ACE is in your face  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah, but I've been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
They say I come from  
Another place  
In your face  
Oh yeah, I'm the man  
From outer space  
  
Now ask me no questions  
And I'll tell you no lies  
I never say never  
I never say die  
  
You might be hallucinating  
I can't tell if you are on glue  
What I can't have  
Is what I want  
I think you know it's true  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah, but I've been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
Everyone knows I come from  
Outer space  
In your face  
Just don't forget  
I'll always be there  
In your face  
  
That's right  
I'm the man  
That's right, curly  
That's right  
I'm the ace
