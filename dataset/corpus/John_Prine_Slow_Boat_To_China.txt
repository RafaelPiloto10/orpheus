Lets take our time and go the long way  
On a junk boat to thailand with your hand in mine hand

Well, this old boats go no sail so won't you please hold our mail-  
For awhile  
Thanks anyway pal but the suez canal -  
Ain't our style

New way to play those same old games  
The stars just might show us and the captain will know us  
Shake our hands and call us by our first names  
Well send a postcard to grandpa of a vase or rickshaw-  
He don't care  
Well buy mom a kimono or maybe well just phone her -

On the bay  
Well build house on the hill next to shangri-li bill -  
And well stay
