Love doesn't come with a contract  
You give me this I give you that  
And it's scary business  
Your heart and soul is on the line  
Baby why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue-tied  
  
[Chorus]  
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet  
Silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend  
Baby I'm in, I'm in  
  
Baby come on in the water's fine  
I'll be right here you take your time  
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith  
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby I'm in, and I'm in  
  
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
Everything thing I am  
  
Oh, and if I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend, yeah  
If you need a lover and a friend  
Oh baby I'm in, and I'm in,  
Baby I'm in, and I'm in  
  
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
Baby come here, baby come here, baby come here.
