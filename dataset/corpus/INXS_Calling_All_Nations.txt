Well you spent the whole day  
With your axe to the wheel  
Read the late paper  
It was full of bad news  
Excuse me but I think  
What I'm saying is true  
You've got to find some time  
And devote it to you  
So come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
Come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
  
So come on all you people  
With the stars in your hair  
You know what's going on  
There's no need to despair  
Take the chains from you mind  
Take the chains from your feet  
And do the sex dance  
'cause' it's necessary  
  
You don't have to be rich  
You don't have to be famous  
No you just  
Gotta have  
A little bit of patience  
Jump into your old car  
Or take a cab train or boat  
The only thing that matters  
Is that ya really gotta go  
  
So come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
Come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
  
Well you spent the whole day  
With your axe to the wheel  
Read the late paper  
It was full of bad news  
Excuse me but I think  
What I'm saying is true  
You've got to find some time  
And devote it to you  
  
So come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
Come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
  
Callin' all nations [Repeat: x4]  
  
Callin' all nations  
Put it on the line  
Callin' all nations  
Put it on the line  
Callin' all nations  
Put it on the line  
Callin' all nations  
Put it on the line
