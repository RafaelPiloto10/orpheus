Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson, lira, gustafsson  
Everybody need something to believe in  
Everybody need something to put their trust in x2  
Some with luck, put their faith in love  
Some show off and let the money talk  
Some look up, read the stars above  
Some believe in making dead man walk  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2  
Chorus:  
Everybody need something to believe in  
Everybody need something to put their trust in x2  
Free...believe in what you want  
Free...believe in what you want  
Some might say it's a miracle  
Some might call it the destiny  
Some let god, lead them all the way  
Some would say they believe in me  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2  
Chorus
