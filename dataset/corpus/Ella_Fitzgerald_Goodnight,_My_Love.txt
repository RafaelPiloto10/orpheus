Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending,  
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending.  
It was so heavenly, holding you close to me,  
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream,  
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow,  
Til then, my love, how dreary the new day will seem,  
So for the present dear, we'll have to part,  
Sleep tight my love, goodnight my love,  
Remember that you're my sweetheart.
