Sweet Sixteen,  
Sweet Sixteen,  
Sweet Sixteen,  
Ah, you're the sweetest little babe  
That I've ever seen  
  
But you would not  
You would not do  
Everything that I ask you to  
Guess you ran away from your home, darling  
Now, you won't run away from me too  
  
Well, my brother is sent to Korea  
And my sister settled down in New-Orleans  
Guess my mother is up in heaven  
And now I wonder what  
Would happen to me  
  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
You're the sweetest little baby  
That I ever seen
