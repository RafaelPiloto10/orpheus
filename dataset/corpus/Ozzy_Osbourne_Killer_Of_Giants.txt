If none of us believe in war  
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for  
Listen to me everyone  
If the button is pushed  
There'll be nowhere to run  
  
Giants sleeping giants winning wars  
Within their dreams  
Till they wake when it's too late  
And in god's name blaspheme  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Marches of protest not stopping the war  
Or the killer of giants  
The killer of giants  
  
Mother nature people state  
Your case without its worth  
Your seas run dry  
Your sleepless eyes are turning red alert  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Rising so proudly it has nowhere to fall  
This killer of giants  
This killer of giants  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Marches of protest not stopping the war  
Oh the killer of giants  
Oh the killer of giants  
Killer of giants  
Killer of giants
