I hit the highway and I checked the time  
I see the sunrise and it makes me want to change my mind  
Oh I got it bad  
I stopped for a coffee in a nowhere town  
A pretty waitress says "Hey what's the frown  
Boy you got it bad"  
Well so many times you told me before  
If you don't like it, well there's the door  
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
Moonlight on the water still looks the same  
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name  
Guess I got it bad  
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care  
I'll believe her if she says hey baby  
I got to love to spare  
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man  
Tonight I'm taking all I can  
This time I went for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad
