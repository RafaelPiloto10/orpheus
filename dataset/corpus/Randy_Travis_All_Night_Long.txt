Every Saturday long about now  
I feed my chickens and my milking cows  
Air's fillin' up with music ands ong  
Gonna have a party all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
All night long, listen to the fiddle  
Music's goin' strong  
Heart's alive it's Saturday night  
Gonna have a party all night long  
  
I got a gal lives across the creek  
Every time I look at her my knees get weak  
First time I tried to take her on my knee  
She took after me with a singletree  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sun's up high the Fourth of July  
Chickens won't lay and the cow's gone dry  
Creek's dried up, I can't go fishin'  
Should be workin' 'stead of sittin' here wishin'  
  
Big watermelon hangin' on the vine  
Said "Keep Out" I couldn't read that sign  
Gun went off and I started to run  
Left that watermelon in the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sun's comin' up, the rooster's crowin'  
Fiddler's gone, I got to be goin'  
Back to the house across the creek  
But we'll be back at the end of the week  
  
[Chorus]
