Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit  
Everyone could see him fall  
And be sure it's been his last hit  
He's never been seen at all  
  
Some dictator felt progressive  
And lay down in the sun  
But his people were aggressive  
They killed him with a gun  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right  
You'll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
So better use your brain  
  
A little dragon could spit fire  
But never so for something bad  
He didn't know the knight's desire  
To throw a lance into his head  
  
Romeo loved his Juliet  
Their parents told them "Stop"  
Then it all turned out peculiar  
He couldn't get it up  
  
And it's all in vain  
When you're living with pain  
Reap not goods you have grown  
By your own  
  
Feelings you like  
Disappear overnight  
You sip up every grin  
Free to win  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
You nearly go insane  
  
A spaceman flies the rocket  
That takes him to the stars  
Thinks his wife is in his pocket  
But she's strolling 'round in bars  
  
The king of Los Angeles  
Bought himself a teddy bear  
And the queen became shameless  
She did it with a chair  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right  
You'll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
So better use your brain
