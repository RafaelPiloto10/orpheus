Without wishing to cause you any pain  
I got to push on through babe  
And if I take the chance of seeing you again  
I just don't know what I would do baby  
And sometimes I think I'm gonna be just fine  
All I got to do is go through it babe.  
  
Then I hear those voices in the back of my mind  
Telling me over and over and over that I blew it babe.  
  
You had one chance and you blew it  
You may never get another chance  
You had the floor and you knew it  
You can't blame it on your circumstance  
At the risk of causing you a little pain  
I'm going to have to forget you, babe  
'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain  
And you'd the same again if I let you, babe.  
  
I would give anything to hold you in my arms  
But you know I can't do that, baby.  
  
I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made  
Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it.
