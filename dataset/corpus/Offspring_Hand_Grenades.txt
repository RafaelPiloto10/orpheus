Let's make hand grenades  
From common things around the house  
Let's make hand grenades  
Listen up, we'll show you how  
  
Ok now take an old beer bottle  
Fill it up with gasoline  
Some paint thinner for good measure  
And a sprinkle of maganese  
Now stuff a sock into the top  
With a zippo you'll be king  
  
Lets make hand grenades  
It's hours of fun in a little jar  
Let's make hand grenades  
Try one out on your neighbors car
