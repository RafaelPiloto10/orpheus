[Repeat: x6]  
Refugees go 'head and do it  
Paper  
Go 'head and do it  
  
Ooh I betca' wondering how I knew  
That you been tryin' to infultrate my crew  
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U.  
Don't get it confused you ain't untouchable  
(Go 'head and do it)  
And while I been tryin' to keep my cool like a queen  
(Ooh like a queen)  
Without them bringin' the naughty girl outta me  
(Ooh, naughty girl outta me)  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine  
While I shine, you're living fake lives  
Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine  
But while I shine ya lip and fake y'all styles  
All around me  
  
(Hata's tryin' to play La'  
But they know that they can't take her paper)  
Go 'head and do it  
Everybody talking see  
Spreadin' them lies about my friends and me  
They say that we're tighter than suppose to get  
That's because I haven't let ya chill wit me yet  
You make it hard for a girl to roll  
(Ooh, girl to roll)  
But make it easy so my pockets stay swol'  
(ooh, pockets stay swol')  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's right, yeah  
Check it, check it, why  
Check it, check it  
Come on, come on  
Yo, yo  
Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?  
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?  
  
As I look back on my life (check it)  
To get where I am I had to sacrifice  
You slammed my name in your magazine  
This business gets hard tryin' to stay a queen  
You're checkin' for me, you need to check yourself  
(Ooh, check yourself)  
And be someone, not someone else  
(Ooh, someone else)  
  
Refugees go 'head and do it  
Paper  
Go 'head and do it
