I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way  
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home.  
  
Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.
