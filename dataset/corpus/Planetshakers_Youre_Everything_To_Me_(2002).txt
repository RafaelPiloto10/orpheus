You have come into my heart  
Turned my life around  
You have made something new  
Turned me upside down  
  
I will never be the same  
You showed me how to change  
Always will my heart be true  
Cos I wanna live for You  
(we're gonna dance before the King)  
  
Cos You are the One I want  
You are the One I need  
You are the One I love  
Cos Jesus You're Everything  
  
You are the Great all Mighty,  
You are the Light inside me  
You are the One I love  
Cos Jesus You're Everything
