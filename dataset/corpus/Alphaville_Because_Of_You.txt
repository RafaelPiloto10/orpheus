Oh, I want to know I want to go  
Through that situation again, I'd like to catch  
That something in your eyes it thrilled me once again  
That gentle touch I can't describe  
It's like a reflection of the moon on the water  
Don't let it go, because of you the earth stood still  
Just do it again  
Burn, burn away, sacred letters, ragged backdrops  
I don't care, the certainty of death,  
The boring rituals of life they seem so far  
I don't care for my life, I just live for your love  
That is because of what you do, just do it again  
Because of you the earth stood still  
Just do it again
