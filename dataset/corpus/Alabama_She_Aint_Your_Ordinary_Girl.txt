She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She don't love carelessly that's what I've always heard  
'Can't use the usual lines she measures every word  
No empty promises proof is what it takes to win her heart  
The truth and nothing less, simple things that set her far apart  
Save your diamonds and your furs she's not your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, no she's not  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, oh no  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
No midnight alibis, no foolish games for her  
And if you cross the line you'll get what you deserve  
But when you see her smile nothing seems to matter anymore  
And in a little while you'll feel like you've never felt before  
Like no other in the world, she's not your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, no she's not  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, oh no  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
Save your diamonds and your furs, she ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl
