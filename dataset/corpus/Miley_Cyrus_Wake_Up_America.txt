Oh can you take of her  
Oh maybe you can spare her  
  
Several moments of your consideration  
Leading up to the final destination  
  
Oh the earth is calling out,  
I wanna learn what it's all about,  
But everything I read global warming going green  
I don't know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
Stand up I'll try if you will  
Wake up it's not a fire drill  
All she needs is a little attention  
Can you give her just a little attention'  
  
Uh oh it's easy to look away  
But it's getting harder day by day  
  
Everything I read global warming going green  
I don't know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
I know that you don't want to hear it  
Especially coming from someone so young  
  
But in the back seat yeah they want to hear it (they want to hear it)  
  
So come on (turn in up)  
Come on (turn it up)  
So come oooooooon (turn it up)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way
