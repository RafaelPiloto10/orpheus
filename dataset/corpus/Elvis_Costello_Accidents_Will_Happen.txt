Oh, I just don't know where to begin  
Love doesn't wait forever  
It's now or never  
But she keeps 'em hangin' on  
You said you're so alone  
She says she can't go home without a chaperon  
  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
There's so many fish in the sea  
That only rise up on the sweat and smoke of mercury  
But they keep you hangin' on  
They say you're so young  
Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
It's the damage that we do we never know  
It's the words that we don't say that scare me so  
There's so many people to see  
So many people to hangin' on and add to your collection  
But they keep you hangin' on  
Until you well hung  
Your mouth is make up but your mind is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They're only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what it  
I know what it  
I know what it done  
I know (x4)
