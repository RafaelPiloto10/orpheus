Love oh love careless love  
Love oh love careless love  
Love oh love oh careless love  
See what careless love has done  
  
Once I wore my apron low  
Once I wore my apron low  
Once I wore my apron low  
I couldn't keep you from my door  
  
What oh what will mama say  
What oh what will mama say  
What oh what will mama say  
When she learns I've gone astray  
  
I love my mama and papa too  
I love my mama and papa too  
I love my mama and papa too  
See what I get for lovin' you  
  
Now I wear my apron high  
Now I wear my apron high  
Now I wear my apron high  
You pass my door you walk on by
