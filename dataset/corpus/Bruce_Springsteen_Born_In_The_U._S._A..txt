Born down in a dead mans town  
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground  
End up like a dog that's been beat too much  
Till you spend half your life just covering up  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Got in a little hometown cream  
So they put a rifle in my hand  
Sent me off to a foreign land  
To go and kill the yellow man  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Come back home to the refinery  
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"  
Went down to see my V.A. man  
He said "son, don't you understand"  
  
I had a brother at Khe Sahn  
Fighting off the Viet Cong  
They're still there, he's all gone  
  
He had a woman he loved in Saigon  
I got a picture of him in her arms now  
  
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary  
Out by the gas fires of the refinery  
I'm ten years burning down the road  
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.
