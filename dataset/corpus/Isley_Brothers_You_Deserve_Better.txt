Oh, oh I  
(Hear me now, hear me now, hear me now)  
Oh, oh I  
Oh, oh I  
(Hear me now, hear me now, hear me now)  
Oh, oh I, yeah  
  
He never took you to a picture show (Oh why)  
He never took you to a carnival (Oh why)  
You never had a picnic in the park (Oh why)  
He never took you dancin' after dark  
See you deserve better babe  
  
[Chorus]  
You deserve better babe  
(Than the man that just don't care)  
You deserve better babe  
(Ain't no good if he ain't never there)  
You deserve better babe  
(Here me now, hear me now, hear me now)  
You deserve better, better  
Even better babe (Even better babe)  
  
He never took you on a shopping spree (Oh why)  
Just bought hisself another diamond ring (Oh why)  
He never offered up to pay a bill (Oh why)  
But 4 am, you know he wants it still  
See you deserve better babe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See every girl deserves a little wine and dine  
Pop the Cristal cuz we gon' feel wild  
So let me pour it out, I'll do it quick no doubt  
Let me fill up your glass, I'm 'gona make it last  
Any man that have you, he should blow your mind  
Boom boom boom, your mind  
So listen to me girl, don't waste no more time  
Don't be wasting no time  
See you deserver better babe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See if it's loving you (I can do it better)  
Or taking care of you (I can do it better)  
Or being true to you (I can do it better)  
I'll do whatever you want me to  
  
See if it's loving you (I can do it better)  
Or taking care of you (I can do it better)  
Being true to you (I can do it better)  
I'll do whatever you want me to (I can do it better)  
  
You deserve better babe (Hear me now, hear me now)  
You deserve better babe (Hear me now, hear me now)  
You deserve better babe (Hear me now, hear me now)  
You deserve better, better  
Even better babe  
  
I can do what your man won't do  
Oh, I can do it better (I can do it better)  
Anything you want (I can do it better)  
I got it  
Oh, I (I can do it better)  
Anything you need (I can do it better)
