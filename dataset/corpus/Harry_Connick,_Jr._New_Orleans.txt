Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
And miss her each night and day  
I know I'm not wrong because the feeling's  
Getting stronger the longer I stay away  
  
Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines  
Where mockingbirds used to sing  
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi  
Running in the spring  
  
Moonlight on the bayous  
Creole tunes fill the air  
I dream about magnolias in June  
And I'm wishin I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When that's where you left your heart  
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans
