Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway  
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad  
Thinking I'm gay  
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport  
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort  
(Of a guy)  
  
But there's one thing I'm lacking  
It's sexual experience  
So I ask you, my sweetheart  
Save me from this wilderness  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
  
Where I come from, love is  
Just a hole in the wall  
And the steel mills ring out and generations  
Heed the call  
  
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey  
And the chance of romance  
Slim as a bright sunny day  
  
This is partly the reason  
I'm so overwhelmed and shy  
Because your beauty, by contrast  
Is gonna make a young man cry  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
  
You don't know what it means to a boy from  
A suburban home  
To be left with a woman like you  
Completely alone  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
Nice place you've got here, babe  
Never seen a house like this  
  
Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch  
  
All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck  
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke  
(Than me)  
  
So here we are, the record's  
Gotten stuck in the groove  
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey  
Of a night like this  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
