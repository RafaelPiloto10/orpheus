Little darling, gonna be a rock and roll star  
Little darling, gonna play electric guitar  
Little darling, I'd like to get to know you  
Pleased to meet you, how do you do?  
  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, little darling  
  
Little darling, gonna love you tonight  
Little darling, gonna shake, shake, boogaloo  
Little darling, can I rattle my bones and dance with you?  
And later on there'll be some lovie dovin'  
  
A little kissing, a little hugging  
A little holding you  
  
Little darling, what's your mama mama going to do?  
Little darling, when she finds out  
I stayed out all night with you?  
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you  
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you  
  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, gonna love you tonight
