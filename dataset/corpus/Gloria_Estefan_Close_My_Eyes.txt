If I could just close my eyes  
See just what I wanted to see  
It would be much easier to live this life  
Thinkin' that it never really comes down to me  
Sometimes I wanna close my eyes  
So I can't see time while it's slippin' away  
We're all walkin' on a very fine line  
'Til reality is somehow thrown in our face  
Bury it deep and maybe you won't feel the pain  
(Feel the pain)  
But you can't let it go  
Down the line, will be back again  
If we could all close our eyes  
All the things we know that are wrong  
We could live, selfishly protected lives  
Not even think about, what we could have done  
Say it's not there and maybe it will go away  
(Go away)  
But the truth is it won't  
Down the line, will be back again  
It will be back again  
Rather than examine it  
Maybe I should handle it  
What good is it, to close my eyes  
And tell myself another lie  
I gotta get along somehow and sometimes the only way  
Is to close my eyes  
Somtimes I have to close my eyes  
Let you think, you can make a fool out of me  
Guess I set myself up each time  
By trustin' you, so openly  
Yeah, that's the way I wanna be  
That's the way I wanna be  
Woo  
Somtimes I have to close my eyes
