There's a new wind blowing like I've never known  
I'm breathing deeper than I've even done  
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do  
And I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
And I let go of all my lonely yesterdays  
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made  
Now there's just one thing the only thing I want to do  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
I used to run in circles going nowhere fast  
I'd take one step forward and took two steps back  
I couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
Oh here we go now, ooo, yeah,  
Hey I want to love ya baby,  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
Yea I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Well baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do  
  
Sometime it's hard for me to understand  
But your teaching me to be a better man  
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no no  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
Hey I want to love ya baby, ah uh  
  
I want to be the man in the middle of the night shining like it's true  
I wanna to be the man that you run to whenever I call on you  
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way  
I wanna be a better man I can see it in you yeah  
  
Hey I want to love you baby  
  
Ah ah yeah, na na na na na
