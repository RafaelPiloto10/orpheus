Going to write a three act play  
So I can be with you  
Produce, direct, and also act  
But who will I cast as you?  
  
I'm gonna find her, I'm gonna find her  
It won't be easy but I don't care  
I'll go to London, new york or Hollywood  
I'll search the world for a girl  
  
I want you  
I don't want nobody else  
I want you  
I should have known it all along  
I want you  
Just tell me when and where  
I want you  
Why don't you just give me a call?  
  
She went west so religiously  
She took a vow  
Not to return until she learned  
What to do and how  
  
I'm gonna find her, I'm gonna find her  
It won't be easy but I don't care  
I'll go to London, new york or Hollywood  
I'll search the world for a girl  
Exactly like you  
Uh huh, I'd rather have you, oh yeah  
  
I want you  
I don't want nobody else  
I want you  
I should have known it all along  
  
I want you  
Right now, I need you right now  
I want you  
Oh come on little girl  
I want you  
Just tell me where and when  
I want you  
Why don't you just give me a call?  
  
I want you  
I don't want nobody else  
I want you  
I should have known it all along  
I want you  
Just tell me when and where  
I want you  
Why don't you just give me a call?  
I want you, I want you, you you you
