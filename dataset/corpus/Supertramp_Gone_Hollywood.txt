It's just heartbreaking  
I should have known that it would let me down  
It's just a mind aching  
I used to dream about this town  
It was a sight to see, the place to be  
Where the living is easy  
And the kicks can always be found  
  
It's such a shame about it  
I used to think that it would feel so good  
But who's to blame about it  
So many creeps in Hollywood  
I'm in this dumb motel near the Taco Bell  
Without a hope in hell, I can't believe that I'm still around  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away  
  
I've had too much cryin', seen too much grief  
I'm sick of tryin' it's beyond belief  
I'm tired of talking on the telephone  
They're trying to tell me that they're not at home  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
I'm tired of walking from place to place  
I've yet to come across a friendly face  
And now the words sound familiar, as them slam the door  
'You're not what we're looking for!  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away  
  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
  
It was a heartbreaking  
Now I ride in the big fine car  
It was mind aching  
I'm the talk of the boulevard  
So keep your chin up boy, forget the pain  
I know you'll make it if you try again  
There's no use in quitting  
When the world is waiting for you
