[Xzibit]  
Last but not least we off the leash  
The Art of War reach for your masterpiece  
Feel the release from the phantom bangs you  
Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you  
Comin at you niggas from a different angle  
Arch Angel choke hold and strangled  
Kay Slay the game turn the tables  
Get cables, I'm Kane you Abel  
Start bullshit, conflicts, labels  
Man handled, murder, mangled  
Life support cut short we hold court  
In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep  
Fuck piece bare back doggystyle  
Cement ya feet and hold ya down  
Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown  
Last one to laugh its over now  
  
[Hook]  
We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan  
Break ya bitch and take ya doe  
Shake ya Crys and take it whoa  
Layin down the whole dance floor  
(Break yourself right now)  
Open bar free drinks this way  
Walkin the West, possin the South  
Coke can put these in ya mouth  
Hands up jack the whole crowd  
(Break yourself right now)  
  
[Xzibit]  
Break crash from ya ass so don't rush to bust  
Bitches die, cry, and lust for us  
Damn it feel good to be platinum plus  
Don't fuck wit us cuzz we dangerous  
Hold fans like fiends on Angel Dust  
Clean get aways I get out the cuffs  
Coast like a sailor you fuckin fucks  
I done hand it hard to keep in touch  
Don't pop the Crys I pop the clutch  
Pop one to ya mouth cuzz you talk too much  
Way in over ya head you get played  
Left holdin the bag like John Forte  
Built for this all work no play here to stay  
The rest get blown away  
Built for this all work no play here to stay  
The rest get blown away  
see'mon

[Xzibit]  
Neva seen heard felt befo  
want to rumble wit us just start the show  
Fill up the chamber let me go  
Out of town before the shells hit the floor  
Duck tape ski mask professional  
Fuck why'all, why'all homosexual  
Hangin on my dick like testicle  
Pop you disappear, "Where did he go?"  
Pop up some where in Mexico  
Rotate relate respect the flow  
Hospital bed you vegetable  
Can't walk can't talk lettin you know  
We hit the hardest ask ya ho, at my show  
Seen her in the front row  
To the back stage in there she blow  
There she blew  
Then send her back to you (hello)
