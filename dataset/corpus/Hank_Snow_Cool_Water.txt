All day I've faced a barren waste  
Without the taste of water, cool water  
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry  
And souls that cry for water  
Cool, clear, water  
  
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you?  
  
The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
Each star's a pool of water  
Cool water  
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn  
And carry on to water  
Water, water, water  
  
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you?  
  
Cool, clear, water  
Cool, clear, water
