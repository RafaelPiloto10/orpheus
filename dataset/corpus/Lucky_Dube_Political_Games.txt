How do you feel when you lie?  
Straight faced while people cry  
How do you feel when you promise something  
That you know you'll never do  
Giving false hope to the people  
Giving false hope to the underpriviledged  
Do you really sleep at night?  
When you know you're living a lie  
To you it is just a job  
To the people it hurts to the bone  
Chorus  
Ooh political games that they play x 4  
What do you say to the orphans?  
Of the women and men you sent to war  
What do you say to the widows?  
Of the men you sent to war  
Telling them it is good for the country  
When you know it's good for your ego  
What a shame.  
Do you really sleep at night?  
When you know you're living a lie  
You talking tough, you talking sincerely  
Giving false hope to the infected  
Giving false hope to the affected.  
To you it is just a job  
To the people it hurts to the bone.  
Chorus  
Ooh political games that they play  
Reap till fade.
