I am afraid of the dark  
I am afraid of the day  
I am afraid to walk outside  
And of what people say  
  
I am afraid to drink too much  
Because of what I might do  
I am afraid to speak my mind  
And of being with you  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to be unloved  
I am afraid to be forsaken  
I am afraid of doing wrong  
And to never be forgiven  
  
I am afraid that you will find  
I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not afraid to be alone  
And of the unknown  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to laugh out loud  
Or to stand out of the crowd  
I am scared of loving you  
I am scared to lose you  
  
I am afraid to lose control  
I am afraid of growing old  
I am afraid to die  
But it's something I must do  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for two
