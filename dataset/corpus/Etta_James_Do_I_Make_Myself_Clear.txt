With Sugar Pie Desanto  
  
I don't wanna believe  
The bad things about you  
Oh, no, now  
  
Cause if they're true  
I'll have to get along without you  
Oh, ooh, now  
  
I said the word, the sound  
The song about the things you do  
  
Moving and a grooving  
Using and a fooling  
Chasing around every skirt in town  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said you're gonna have to  
Stop and check yourself  
Oh, yeah, now  
  
I'm not gonna have a man  
That's got somebody else, oh, no  
Oh, you tell him now, girl, now, now  
  
So if you're running around, baby  
Thinking of putting me down  
You're wrong  
  
Taking away what belongs to me  
Giving to her when I'm in need  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said, do, do I  
Do I make myself clear  
Do you understand me  
Do, do I, do I make myself clear  
Oh, you better listen to her now  
  
Oh, yeah, ohh, yeah, now  
Oh, oh, oh...  
  
So why won't you try to do  
Something to change it  
Yeah, yeah  
  
And make me know it's not  
The way they claim it, oh, yeah  
Now let me tell you something  
  
All I wanted you to be true, honey  
Love me like you say you do, oh, yeah  
And I won't care for what they say  
Instead, I'll turn my head and walk away  
But if it's true, you know what to do  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said, do, do I  
Do I make myself clear  
And oh, oh, oh, yeah, now  
Oh, oh...  
  
I said do, do, do, do  
Do I make myself clear
