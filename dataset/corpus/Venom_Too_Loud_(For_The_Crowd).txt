Too loud..  
Death defying mayhem volume  
Screaming through the stacks  
Stop and stare at the demons lair  
Burning so fast  
You won't last  
Crazed in sweat and blasphemy  
But still we cannot hear  
Legions rise, fell their eyes  
You live in fear  
You came to jeer  
Don't dicatate to us  
We were the first  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Souls of ninety thousand fold  
Are only steps away  
In the night, flames alight  
Until that day, were here to stay  
Blackened power metal marches  
Through the gates of Hades  
Weak and blind we leave behind  
Bring down the lights  
Inject the ice  
Lucifer sings 'Let it begin'  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Too loud  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud
