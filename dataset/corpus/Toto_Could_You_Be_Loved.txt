Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
Don't let them fool you, or even try to school you, oh! no  
We've got a mind of our own, so go to hell if what you're thinking is not
right  
Love would never leave us alone  
I say the darkness there must come out to light  
  
Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved  
  
Don't let them change you, or even rearrange you, oh! no  
We've got a life to live, they say only, only  
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive  
Stay alive  
  
Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
  
You ain't gonna miss your water, until your well runs dry  
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved  
  
Say something, say something, say something  
Say something, say something, say something  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved
