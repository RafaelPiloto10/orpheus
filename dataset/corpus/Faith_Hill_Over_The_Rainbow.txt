(E. Y Harnburg)  
  
Hooh  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream  
Yes they do, really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where  
The clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney top  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly, hoah  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why, oh why, can't I  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Above the rainbow  
Why, oh why, can't I
