I kiss him goodnight and tell him I love him then I keep my rendezvous  
Knowing that when I go to sleep I'm gonna dream about you  
I can't make my dreams understand that it's wrong  
To dream about you when with him I belong  
I've made vows to God and I've made vows to man  
But I just can't make my dreams understand  
[ guitar ]  
My fingers are crossed when I say I'm happy but lying just don't make it right  
And each night when I go to sleep I dream you are holding me tight  
I can't make my dreams...
