My heart beats, wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
Hard to breathe, I can't speak  
Think of your love and just how much I want it  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm touching you, I feel a sudden change  
When I'm kissing you, I taste the sun and rain  
When I look at you, I hear the angels sing  
And when I'm holding you, I'm holding everything  
  
Everything that's mine to give  
Everything I can do, I'll do to prove it  
For as long (for as long)  
As I may live (as I may live)  
My love will be there for you to use it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything, I'm holding everything  
When I'm touching you, I'm touching everything  
When I'm kissing you, I'm kissing everything  
Everything (everything) uh huh  
  
My heart beats, wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
It's hard to breathe (it's hard to breathe)  
And I can't speak (I can't speak)  
Think of your love and just how bad I, want it  
  
And when you're touching me, I feel a sudden change  
When you're kissing me, I taste the sun and rain  
And when I look at you, I hear the angels sing  
  
You're everything (everything)  
I'm holding everything (everything)  
Everything (you're everything)  
You're everything (everything to me)  
Everything (everything)  
You're everything
