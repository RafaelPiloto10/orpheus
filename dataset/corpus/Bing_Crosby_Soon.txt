Soon, the lonely nights will be ended,  
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended.  
I've found the happiness I've waited for,  
The only girl that I was fated for.  
  
Oh! Soon, a little cottage will find us  
Safe with all our cares far behind us.  
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,  
Let's make that day come soon.  
  
Soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely,  
Soon, you'll find I live for you only.  
When I'm with you who cares what time it is  
Or what the place or the climate is?  
  
Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing  
Home through every storm, never failing,  
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,  
Let's make that day come soon.
