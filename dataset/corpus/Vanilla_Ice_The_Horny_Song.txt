[Verse 1]  
Now that ya feelin it I see you're getting weak  
You're gettin real close  
You're reachin that peak  
Uh  
You're like high altitude in a lear jet  
Work them hips like a pistons in a corvette  
Slow down or I'll have to pull ya over  
Search ya, handcuff ya, and do a move on ya  
You get a gwb stands for girl with a body pump it like a hottie  
Seems like you got switches and you're hittin em  
Two wheel motion keep bumpin em  
Now throw it east to west and put a hump in it  
Back stroke, and boogie with a bump in it  
Tell me how ya do it like that, how ya got stacked  
How you scrambled like a quarter back  
I want you weak in the knees and shaking in your pants  
And all I want to do is make you dance  
Come on!  
[Chorus]  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
[Verse 2]  
See the sweat that you're lettin off  
Now, keep it comin girl  
Ya know I love it when you take it off  
You got me sittin in the hot seat  
Drippin from the body heat  
From my head to my feet  
We can do it by candle light all night  
Keep it goin till the sunlight, that's right  
Whatcha tryin to do, make the ice melt?  
Don't you know my cream is good for your health?  
You know you want to shake what your mamma gave ya  
You're getting real hot, now I'm gonna spray ya  
Rub it in like lotion  
Juices flowin everywhere  
Like water in the ocean  
You got that hourglass figure  
Uh, All the right moves  
And ya know I want to dig ya  
Got 31 flavors, know what I mean?  
And I want to take a dip in your ice cream  
[Chorus]  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
[Verse 3]  
Know I'll be the one to kick this shit off  
And crank it up like a 250  
Engine in a motorcross  
And make ya feel it girl  
Till ya get sick with it  
And all that junk in your trunk  
Don't be stingy with it  
And I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend  
You got enough for yourself and for all my friends  
And it's enough of me to go round like the globe  
Set it up like a tent, watch it unfold  
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's  
But you ain't gotta fake it  
I just want you to shake it  
Break me off a piece of that action like jackson  
I ain't trying to hit it  
And I ain't trying to wax it  
Picture you and me on the beach and you be  
Climbing up this tall coconut tree  
All I want to do is hump with it and make you scream  
And eat you up  
As I floss with your g-string  
[Chorus]  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come
