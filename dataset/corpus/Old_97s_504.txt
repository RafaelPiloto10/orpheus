I was playing every Monday on Burgundy in some shitty little bar  
I was working on a novel called 'New Orleans Ain't No City', it's a Scar  
The heroine does heroin, the hero wears his hair just like The King  
He says, "It ain't my job to sweet talk you, my job's just to sing"  
I was loved once by a woman  
She don't love me anymore, 504, 504  
And I won't never know no woman like the one  
I'd known before 504, 504, and she don't love me anymore  
Well, the hero wears a hair-net  
From the outset he drinks Jax beer from a can  
He says, "There's something 'bout this city always gets me  
I'm a sentimental man"  
Well the heroine plays violin  
And reads her Elmore Leonard everyday  
She's the one that finds the body  
He's the one that gets away  
I was loved once by a woman  
She don't love me anymore, 504, 504  
And I won't never know no woman like the one  
I'd known before 504, 504, and she don't love me anymore  
I was loved once by a woman  
She don't love me anymore, 504, 504  
And I won't never know no woman like the one  
I'd known before 504, 504  
You know she had me singing Gospel out in the kitchen  
On the floor 504, 504, and she don't love me anymore  
No she don't love me anymore  
No she don't love me anymore, 504
