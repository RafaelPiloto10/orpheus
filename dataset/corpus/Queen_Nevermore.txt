There's no living in my life anymore  
The seas have gone dry  
And the rain's stopped falling  
Please don't you cry any more  
Can't you see  
Listen to the breeze  
Whisper to me please  
Don't send me to the path of nevermore  
  
Even the valley's below  
Where the rays of the sun  
Were so warm and tender  
Now haven't anything to grow  
Can't you see?  
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)  
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)  
You sent me to the path of nevermore  
When you say you didn't love me anymore  
Ah ah nevermore nevermore
