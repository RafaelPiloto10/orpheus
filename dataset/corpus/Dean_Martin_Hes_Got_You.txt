I got your picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got your picture, he's got you  
I got your records that we used to share  
And they still sound the same as when you lived here  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the records, he's got you  
I've got your memory or has it got me  
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be  
I've got your class ring that proved you care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I've got these little thing, he's got you  
I've got your memory or has it got me  
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be  
I've got your class ring that proved your care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I've got the little thing, he's got you
