[Verse:]  
I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside  
I stepped out the door to New York City, my hair was barely dry  
I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside  
Nothin' happened in the elevator, nothing happening on the stairs  
Nothing ever happenin' when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there  
How'd you find a party when you're in your room?  
How'd you find the action man? The action is everywhere!  
And decide to climb outside your bedroom window, paint a picture on a clock  
Oh if you decide that you can't hide inside your mind  
Provide the slide to get you out  
Feels just like you're fallin' and you're goin' down  
And everybody luvs ya when you hit the ground  
I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to Pocahontas  
I pray to John Appleseed  
Oh, I cigarette the winter air, then I finna stare my way down 7th street  
Some chick yells Jesus luvs me more than I know but less than I need  
I play down the valley to the? And then I step off into the air  
Point my sunglasses east towards Jerusalem and then follow all the pharoahs
there  
They're buildin' pyramids in the Western Square  
Drivin' in circles 'round the circus til the circles in the air  
My love says come on Adam tell me what the hell is wrong with you  
She says, come on, Adam tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do!  
She says I could love you, I could leave you  
But I can't live what you put me through  
I call the winter Maria cuz I do not know her face  
I call the endless sky Emilia cuz she stays with me from place to place  
I call the sun my love Emanuel, she cradle me in her embrace  
I left, nothin' happening in the kitchen, nothing happening on the floor  
Nothin' happenin' in my bed, she don't sleep there no more  
Hard to find the bottom when you're in the air  
Hey man, how'd you find the circus, we have the circus is everywhere?
