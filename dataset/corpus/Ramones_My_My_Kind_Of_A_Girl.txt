When I saw you on Eighth Street  
You could make my life complete, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl  
  
And when I saw you by  
The jukebox, ow-ow  
You put a quarter in and played  
My favorite song too, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl  
  
I think we'd look pretty good together,  
Walking through a winter wonderland  
And this time I think it's forever  
I hope your parents understand  
  
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge  
You were lost but you've been found, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl
