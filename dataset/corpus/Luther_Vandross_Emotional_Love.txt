I think love should be heaven sent  
I can't love you just to pay your rent  
  
Heart to heart is the way it should be  
You've got to love with devotion to emotion  
Don't hold back, talk to me, let it go  
Cry on my shoulder honey, don't you know that?  
  
If it's going to be an  
Emotional love  
Then it's got to start with an  
Emotional heart  
No I can't deny I'm an  
Emotional guy  
So I search the world for the  
Emotional girl  
  
Happy to be the love of your life  
Some guys want you for only one night  
  
Can't explain all this love that I feel  
Sometimes my mind is a ball of confusion  
Love will fix it eventually  
Don't tell your friends about it, come to me
