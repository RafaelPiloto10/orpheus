  
  
  
  
You ran away with your conscience dear  
  
There was a red flag waving in my ear saying  
  
"Stay away, you've got something to fear"  
  
Well why did I not choose to hear?  
  
Well I am through with suffering  
  
Gonna make better choices I don't need no wedding ring  
  
I can sing, I can dance  
  
But I can't make thus feeling cease  
  
Cause deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
We all got our cross to bear  
  
Our Star of David, our dreadlocked hair  
  
And oh yeah baby, I still care  
  
And if you need some help  
  
You know I'll always be there  
  
  
Well it's been a strange year  
  
You've been a very bad dog  
  
As my fire went out  
  
You'd put on another log  
  
But it was worth never having any peace  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
  
Some nights I thought I'd cry forever  
  
I'd wish him away and then I'd turn into a beggar  
  
But it was worth always scraping my knees  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease  
  
  
I wear my heart like a wrinkle on my sleeve  
  
  
And I've got the aching love that only you can relieve  
  
But I'm not afraid to go down with a sinking friend  
  
I'm gonna live out my dreams even if they kill me in the end  
  
  
Repeat chorus
