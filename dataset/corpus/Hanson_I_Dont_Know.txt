I don't know  
  
Well I can't take this any longer  
I can't do this anymore  
I'm not getting any stronger  
I don't know how to feel this anymore  
  
You can tell me what you want  
After all that youve done for me  
We can make it all undone  
But can't you see that  
  
I don't know what to think  
And you can tell if I'm dreamin  
And I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking  
That I don't know what I'm feeling  
We just need special breathing  
I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking that I don't know  
  
I could search a thousand times before  
I'm up against a wall I can't ignore  
I wish you didn't feel so good to hold  
Cause then it wouldn't be so hard to know  
  
You can tell me what you want  
After all that youve done for me  
We can make it all undone  
But can't you see that  
  
I don't know what to think  
And you can tell if I'm dreamin  
And I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking  
That I don't know what I'm feeling  
We just need special breathing  
I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking that I don't know  
  
I wish I could tell you  
(I wish I could tell you)  
That everythings gonna be alright  
Cause I just wanna love you  
So maybe I could let this go  
  
You can tell me what you want  
After all that you mean to me  
We can make it all undone  
  
I don't know what to think  
And you can tell if I'm dreamin  
And I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking  
That I don't know what I'm feeling  
We just need special breathing  
I wish that I could just let this go  
But I'm thinking that I don't know
