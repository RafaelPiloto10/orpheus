When the time comes around  
I want you to know  
You can count on me  
When it all comes down  
You'll know where I'll be  
Standing right next to you  
'Cos I'll be true to you  
I'll be true to you  
  
When the days grow dark  
And the winds grow cold  
I'll still be with you  
I'm tried and I'm tested  
And I won't let you down  
You can count on me  
Because I'll be true to you  
I'll be true to you  
  
This love that I've found  
It flows like a river  
And it's all for you  
The streets of this town  
Speak only one name  
And that name is you  
  
So when the time comes around  
I want you to know  
You can count on me  
When it all comes down  
You'll know where I'll be  
Standing right next to you  
Because I'll be true to you  
I'll be true to you
