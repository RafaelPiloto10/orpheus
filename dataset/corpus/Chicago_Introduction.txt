Hey there everybody  
Please don't romp or roam  
We're a little nervous  
'Cause we're so far from home  
So this is what we do  
Sit back and let us groove  
And let us work on you  
  
We've all spent years preparing  
before this band was born  
With heaven's help it blended  
And we do thank the lord.  
  
Now we put you through the changes  
And turned around the mood  
We hope it's struck you different  
And hope you feel moved  
So forget about your troubles  
As we search for something new  
And we play for you
