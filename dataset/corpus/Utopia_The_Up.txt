I can't stand to watch the six o'clock news  
It's enough to give an average, sensitive person the blues  
Can't get it up  
I don't know about commercial appeal  
But what you put in your head  
Just can't help affect how you  
So lets keep it up  
Prophets of doom try to capture you  
They get around like the Asian flu  
But they can't get me  
  
Because I go for the up  
I'm on the up side  
I look for the up (That down just ain't my style)  
I go for the up  
I'm hooked on the up  
I'm on the upswing (I got my sights set high)  
I go for the up  
  
What's the point of standing out in the rain  
What's the sense of looking down  
It just gives your shoulders a pain  
Can't get it up  
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy  
If you look for the worst then that's just  
What it turns out to be  
So keep looking up  
The fickle finger just may point your way  
It touches someone different every day  
But it can't touch me  
  
Because I go for the up  
And everybody's yelling at me to get back in line  
And they say I'm crazy  
But still they have their sessions of deep depressions  
But it can't get me  
Because I go for the up
