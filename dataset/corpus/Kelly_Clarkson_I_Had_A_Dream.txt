If you wanna lead, be a leader  
If you wanna dream, be a dreamer  
Climb to the top of that mountain, scream it  
But remember when you get to the top  
Every thing you say is gonna matter  
Every thing you do is gonna add up  
It's what you asked for, so  
Don't get mad when it's not what you thought  
  
Careful now girl with them Jezebel ways  
Fell on your head, but you're queen of cliches  
Little one playing with the big boys now  
Hope you're ready when it comes back around  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream  
  
If you wanna preach, be a preacher  
If you wanna teach, be a teacher  
Remember that the footprints you're leaving  
Will tell us all who you really are  
  
It's too bad you can't see what you're worth  
Spreading your legs instead of using your words  
Character is shown by the things that we do  
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth  
  
'Cause anyone can sell when they're selling out  
And anyone can fly when they're falling now  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream  
  
I had a dream!  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream, I had a dream  
I had a dream, I had a dream
