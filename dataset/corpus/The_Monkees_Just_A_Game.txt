There's a way  
There's a way for you and I  
If you'll just stay.  
If you'll just stay to keep me hidden from the day,  
  
And all its light,  
That's covered up by night when you're away.  
When you're away the image of your face is clear,  
It is clear across the room and I am here,  
  
Against the wall, afraid that it is all  
Just a game.  
Just a game that's played in fun  
But not too real.  
  
Not too real to take a chance on finding out  
You've really lost.  
I can't see you clearly while I'm here.  
While I'm here and you are in my state of mind.  
  
My state of mind is changing places all the time,  
And I am lost  
Trying to get across another time.  
When you're away the image of your face is clear,  
  
It is clear across the room and I am here,  
Against the wall, afraid that it is all  
  
Just a game  
Just a game  
Just a game.
