Hear our prayer  
We are Your children  
And we've gathered here today, bless me  
We're gathered here to pray  
  
Hear our cry  
Lord, we need Your mercy  
And we need Your grace today, yes, we do  
Hear us as we pray  
  
[Chorus]  
Our Father, who art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Our Father, hear us from Heaven  
Forgive our sins we pray  
  
Hear our song  
As it rises to Heaven  
May Your glory fill the earth  
As the waters cover the seas  
  
See our hearts  
And remove anything  
That is standing in the way  
Of coming to You today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though we are few  
We're surrounded by many  
Who have crossed that river before  
And this is the song we'll be singing forever  
  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
  
Hear our prayer  
We are Your children  
And we've gathered here today  
We're gathered here to pray  
  
Hear our cry  
Oh Lord, we need Your mercy  
And we need Your grace today, yes, we do  
Hear us as we pray  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Forgive our sins we pray  
Forgive our sins we pray  
Oh yeah
