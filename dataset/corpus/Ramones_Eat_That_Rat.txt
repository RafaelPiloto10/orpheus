One-two-three-four  
  
You don't want to share with anyone else  
You got all the money, you got all the wealth  
You got all the buildings and the factories  
You got all the power and the ceremonies  
  
You wanna play a game of cat and mouse  
With the President in the White House  
This is a hungry world, there are months to feed  
There are millionaires with more than they need  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
  
One-two-three-four  
  
Don't believe what you've been told  
You can't change a turd into gold  
Somehow we get all these creeps in control  
It makes me throw up in the toilet bowl  
  
You thieving whore, you hustle for bucks  
You take the money and you shoot it up  
That's the breaks, it's the chance you take  
Get it together for your children's sake  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat
