My stubborn will at last hath yielded  
I would be Thine and Thine alone  
And this the prayer my lips are bringing  
Lord, let in me Thy will be done  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
  
I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary  
The darksome path hath dreary grown  
But now a light has ris'n to cheer me  
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior  
Doth now embrace and compass me  
The storms have ceased, my peace a river  
My soul a prisoned bird set free  
  
[Chorus]
