You say I waste my life away, but I live it to the full  
And how would you know anyway, you're just mister dull  
Why don't you get into the things we do today  
You could lose twenty years right away, so we say  
  
We don't need, no, no no no parental guidance here  
  
Every day you scream at me to turn the music low  
Well if you keep on screaming, you'll make me deaf you know  
You always chew me out, because I stay out late  
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date, get one thing straight  
  
There's no communication  
I'm tired of explanation  
Is this message getting through  
You went through the same thing too  
Don't you remember what it's like to lose control  
Put on my jacket - for you get too old  
Let's rock n' roll
