Alice, pretty little Alice  
Pretty little Alice in Wonderland  
Alice in wonderland  
Won't you take me by the hand  
And lead me to your wonderland of love  
I took one look at you  
And that was all I had to do  
Alice, you're the girl I'm dreamin of  
Tweedle dum, tweedle dee  
You have made my life a fantasy  
You don't know what you're doin to me  
My heart goes pitter patter cause I'm mad as a hatter for  
Alice my little girl  
There is no other in this whole wide world  
Take me by the hand, tell me you understand  
Alice, Alice in wonderland  
Tweedle dum, tweedle dee  
You have made my life a fantasy  
You don't know what you're doin to me  
My heart goes pitter patter cause I'm mad as a hatter for  
Alice my little girl  
There is no other in this whole wide world  
Take me by the hand, tell me you understand  
Alice, Alice in wonderland  
Oh Alice, pretty little Alice  
Pretty little Alice in wonderland
