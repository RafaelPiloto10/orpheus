(You've been naughty...very very naughty)  
Are you cut up  
Or do you easily forget  
Are you still around  
Why haven't you managed to die yet  
You could prop up the bar in hell  
  
How do you sleep  
You've never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought you'd leave me falling forever  
Karma killer  
  
Needless to say  
I guess you know I hate you  
You're so full of sin  
Even the devil rates you  
I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
How do you breathe  
Why don't you cry  
How come you never ask me why  
You're not a man stand and deliver  
Karma killer  
  
How do you sleep  
You've never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought you'd leave me falling forever  
  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
  
I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
  
I don't need to take revenge  
Cos they're coming to get you  
There's no hope for you my friend  
Cos they're coming to get you  
  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer
