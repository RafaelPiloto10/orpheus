Fall into line upon creation  
There is hell to pay  
Fall into line, life of the mundane  
There is hell to pay  
  
Time, our vengeful warden  
Existence brings forth pain and loss  
Make head of all the costs  
For your end is drawing near  
  
Your end is drawing near  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
Fall into line, death and disease  
There is hell to pay  
Shatter this life, all consuming  
There is hell to pay  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
The end is drawing near  
Forever black  
Your end is near  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
Forever black
