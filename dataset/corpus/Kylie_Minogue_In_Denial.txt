Neil:  
In denial  
No, my life's a trial  
I'm not denying that every little bit hurts  
It's a problem, that I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while,  
Getting away before it gets any worse today  
  
Kylie:  
Your in denial, and that is final  
Your not admitting, you should be quitting  
All these queens and fairies, and muscle Mary's  
The rough trade boyfriend, who in his pathetic own way denies he gay  
Why can't he see this is a fantasy  
  
Neil:  
I think I'm going mad  
How'd you know if your going mad?  
  
Kylie:  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Neil:  
Look at me I'm sad  
I'm not denying, I could be trying, a little harder to deal with some of this
stuff  
  
Kylie:  
Know what I'm thinking, less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes, and you'll feel a little less worth  
  
Neil:  
Is that enough? My life is absurd  
I'm living it upside down  
Like a vampire working at night, Sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows he's gay  
  
Both:  
Can you love me anyway?
