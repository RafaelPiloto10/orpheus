On the eastside, that's where I met my Ramona,  
"I wanna go to a party," that's what she said  
Lonely, that's what I been  
  
Here's my telephone number call me  
And to a party a house par-ty  
Whole lotta people just rally-round-me and love,  
She send a message of love  
She said I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap, BAH BAH.  
Ramona please step back  
  
Cause she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my hiena  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now she selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one tell me  
And she said "Your not the only one, but your the best Bradley"  
And know now I waiting for my Ruca and I barely pulled up with my hiena  
I know tonight I be behind her, don't fuck around with my hiena.
