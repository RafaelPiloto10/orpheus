Learn to love and you learn to survive  
My mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me  
It was the story of my life  
I awakened seeing with new eyes  
I begged forgiveness, but love wouldn't hear me  
Taught you to fear me, baby  
  
Love forgot we used to be just fine  
And love forgot about the tender times  
Love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me  
Give me one more try  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Love can't love someone who breaks a vow  
But I was not myself, my heart wasn't in it  
I still loved you every minute  
I could fix it if you show me how  
You didn't hear it from somebody else, I told you  
Praying you'd let me hold you  
  
(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive  
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it  
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way  
Our poetry will ever rhyme  
I think love forgot this time  
  
But who would have ever known  
I'd ever be tempted, but I'm hopin'  
Love will show me what to do  
'cause if it was all so easy  
Then anybody else coulda shown me  
I don't understand how you wouldn't know  
I never even meant it  
  
(I can't believe) Did love forget this was the only time  
(Impossible) Did love forget I tried to set things right  
(It couldn't be) Did love forget to remember  
That regret lives in this heart of mine  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive  
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it  
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way  
That poetry will ever rhyme  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Did you forget this time  
Did you forget this time  
Don't forget me now  
Don't forget me now  
Did you forget somehow  
Did you forget somehow
