Back In A us Made Car  
(Back In The ussr-Beatles)  
  
Ohhh...  
Used to drive a Honda C-I-V-I-C  
Didn't sleep a wink at night  
Auto-workers laid-off in Detroit last week  
Man it's such a dreadful sight  
  
I'm back in a us made car  
You know how lazy we are, boys  
Back in a us made car  
  
Power steering, power windows, seats and brakes  
It's bigger than the Astrodome  
Drive it under 50 or the back-end shakes  
God I hope it gets me home  
  
I'm back in a us made car  
You know how lazy we are, boys  
Back in a us  
Back in the Do-Less  
Back in a us made car  
  
Those foreign cars really knock me out  
They leave Chevettes behind  
They cruise right past all the screams and shouts  
From gm unemployment li-li  
Li-li-li-li-li-li-lines  
  
Oh tow that Iacocca monster to my house  
You didn't have to twist my arm  
It's my patriotic duty to be helping out  
Can't let the big three buy the farm  
  
I'm back in us made car  
A gallon don't go too far boy  
Back in a us made car
