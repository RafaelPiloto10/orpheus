Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Yes it's so long since I've been home  
Seems like there's no place to roam  
Well I've sailed around the Horn  
I've been from San Jose up to Baffin Bay  
And I've rode out many a storm  
  
Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Well I've heard the bawdy tunes  
I've been in honky tonk saloons  
I took my liquor by the vat  
Well I stayed on call for a rousing brawl  
Home was where I hung my hat  
  
Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Now I've courted many a girl  
I've been in ports all around the world  
But my rambling days are done  
I've been from Curacao up to Tokyo  
And I've found there's only one  
  
And she is Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea
