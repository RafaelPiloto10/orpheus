Every now and then when the lights are low  
Every now and then when the wind does blow  
Every now and then, I think of you  
  
Every now and then when a girl walks by  
And holds her head like you held yours high  
Every now and then, I think of you  
  
And once in awhile when the sun sets right  
And the full moon glides like a diamond in the night  
Every now and then, I think of you  
  
And I remember you and I  
In a soft golden light  
Nothing like here and tonight  
I won't hear about anyone's life but our own  
And all that I have is hope  
Baby you never know  
  
Every now and then when a friend says, "Hi"  
And asks about us I just want to die  
Every now and then, I think of you  
  
I want to say everything's just fine  
But only a fool could believe that line  
Still every now and then, I think of you
