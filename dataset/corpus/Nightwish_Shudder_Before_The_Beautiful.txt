The deepest solace lies in understanding  
This ancient unseen stream  
A shudder before the beautiful  
  
Awake Oceanborn  
Behold this force  
Bring the outside in  
Explore the self to epiphany  
  
The very core of life  
Is soaring higher of truth and light  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers  
  
Tales from the seas  
Cathedral of greed  
  
The very core of life  
Is soaring higher of truth and light  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers  
  
The unknown  
The grand show  
The choir of the stars  
Interstellar  
Theatre play  
The nebula curtain falls  
Imagination  
Evolution  
A species from the veil  
As we wander  
In search of  
The source of the tale  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers
