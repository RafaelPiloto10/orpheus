I was walkin' the other day with my head down,  
When I met a man who had his hand out.  
So I gave him, gave him a dollar,  
But as I walked away I heard him call out,  
  
"Tell me Brother, can you see the sun  
From where you're standin' now?  
I've been up and I've been down,  
But I've never been to this part of town."  
  
So I started thinkin' 'bout, this world we live in,  
And about how far I've got my hand in.  
Sometimes it seems that all we have, we have taken,  
But maybe next time, won't be the forsaken.  
  
Tell me Brother, can you see the sun  
From where you're standin' now?  
I've been up and I've been down,  
But I've never been to this part of town.  
  
So I went to see my girl, told her about my day.  
She said, "Life can be that way.  
But don't give up, don't give up, no,  
'Cause where there is love, there is hope."  
  
Tell me Brother, can you see the sun  
From where you're standin' now?  
I've been up and I've been down,  
But I've never been here before.  
  
Tell me Brother, can you see the sun  
From where you're standin' now?  
I've been up and I've been down,  
But I've never been to this part of town.
