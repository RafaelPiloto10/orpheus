Here I go out to sea again  
The sunshine fills my hair  
And dreams hang in the air  
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes  
You know it feels unfair  
There's magic everywhere  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
The sun in your eyes  
The heat is in your hair  
They seem to hate you  
Because you're there  
I need is friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not stand here on my own  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
I need a friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not so alone  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to run and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life
