I'm headed down a highway got a suitcase by my side  
Blue skies hangin' over my head I got five hundred miles to ride  
I'm goin' down to Memphis town to play a late night show  
I hope the people are ready there 'cause the boys are all ready to go  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller  
That's what I am  
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin'  
Is all I understand  
  
I was born a travelin' man and my feets do burn the ground  
I don't care for fancy music if your shoes can't shuffle around  
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home  
The only time I'm satisfied is when I'm on the road  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes I wonder where will we go  
  
Lord don't take my whiskey, rock and roll  
Take me down to Memphis town, bus driver get me there  
I got me a queenie she got long brown curly hair  
She likes to drink old grandad and her shoes do shuffle around  
And every time I see that gal  
Lord she wants to take me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I wonder where will we go  
Lord don't take my whiskey, rock and roll
