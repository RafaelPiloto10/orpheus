[Verse 1]  
Climb on board  
We'll go slow and high tempo  
Light and dark  
Hold me hard and mellow  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us  
Bodies together  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pillow talk  
My enemy, my ally  
Prisoners  
Then we're free, it's a thriller  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us  
Bodies together  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
  
[Bridge]  
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise  
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone  
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise  
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
