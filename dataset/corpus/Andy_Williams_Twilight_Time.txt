Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's twilight time  
Out of the mist your voice is calling, it's twilight time  
When purple-colored curtains mark the end of day  
I'll hear you, my dear, at twilight time  
  
Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done  
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun  
I count the moments darling till you're here with me  
Together at last at twilight time  
  
Here, in the afterglow of day, we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue  
Here in the sweet and same old way I fall in love again as I did then  
  
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old  
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold  
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you  
Together at last at twilight time  
  
Here, in the afterglow of day, we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue  
Here in the sweet and same old way I fall in love again as I did then  
  
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old  
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold  
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you  
Together at last at twilight time  
Together at last at twilight time
