How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were  
With sweet love and devotion gently touching my emotion  
I want to stop - to thank you baby  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
Open my eyes at night  
I wonder what I would be without you in my life  
Everything was just a bore  
All the things I've done you know I've done them before  
But you brightened up all of my days  
With your love so sweet and in so may ways  
I want to stop - to thank you baby  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
Sweeter than the honey from the bees, baby
