You know I know how  
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out  
The club can't even handle me right now  
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out  
The club can't even handle me right now  
The club can't even handle me right now  
  
Hey  
I own the night and I don't need no help  
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface player  
Stuntin' go wild can't handle this plan  
Life of the club arrogant like yeah!  
Top like money all the girls just melt  
Want so many all know me like Twelve  
Look like cash and they all just stare  
Bottles, Models, standin' on chairs  
Fall out cause that's the business  
All out it's so ridiculous  
Zone out so much attention  
Scream out I'm in the building (hey!)  
They watchin' I know this  
I'm rockin' I'm rolling  
I'm holding, I know it  
You know it  
  
You know I know how  
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out  
The club can't even handle me right now  
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out  
The club can't even handle me right now  
The club can't even handle me right now  
  
Hey  
Still feelin' myself I'm like outta control  
Can't stop now more shots lets go  
Ten more rounds can I get a K-O  
Paparazzi trying to make me pose  
Came to party till I can no more  
Celebrate cause that's all I know  
Tip the groupies takin' off their clothes  
Grand finale' like Superbowl  
Go hard run the show  
That's right wild out got money to blow  
More lights more ice when I walk in the door  
No hype I do it big all over the globe

Confetti
