Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all
