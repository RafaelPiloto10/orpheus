[ENDYAMON:]  
(THE SWORD to I take to the Air, Fear breaks the will of denial)  
You look for me there, hunting the  
Skies I am soundless I fly to the Rainbow, I Conquer the Sky  
The Hammer of Death,  
  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
Grant every Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air,  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing the chains of denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS !  
You look for a Sign, nothing will reveal the Hour  
The Burning of Rome was only a glimpse of my Power  
My Armor is Flame Gold, I sever the Sky  
The Hammer of Death,  
  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
Grant every Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air,  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing with Flame your denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS !  
Watching your children die  
Your fist to the Gods you cry, "  
Why must it be, why am I damned, Forsaken",  
I have always served your Shrines and Alters  
Now I'll see you burn !  
  
[ENDYAMON:]  
Why must this come to pass Gods of the Heaven's vast,  
await the Night you die Now . . .  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS . . .  
Rise . . .  
Cold yet Burning, calm yet so murderous  
We rise like Mist from the Earth As Above so it shall be Below  
We invoke Death with one Final Prayer  
Pain is the Sign  
Where I will find the only shred of Magick that won't be left behind.  
I take to the Air,  
Fear rips the Temples of Power  
My Law is despair, a Vision of Flame I am blinding  
My Sword is the Rainbow, I sever the Sky  
  
[THE SWORD:]  
The Hammer of Death,  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
I am the Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air,  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing the Flames of denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS !  
  
[ENDYAMON:]  
The Blood of Man is the Blood of Vengeance ! ! ! ! ! ! !  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS . . .  
Die . . .  
Down . ..  
Die . . .
