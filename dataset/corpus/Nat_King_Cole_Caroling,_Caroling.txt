Caroling, caroling now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Joyous voices sweet and clear  
Sing the sad of heart to cheer  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
(Caroling, caroling through the town)  
Christmas bells are ringing  
(Caroling, caroling up and down)  
Oh, Christmas bells are ringing  
(Mark ye well the song we sing)  
(Gladsome tidings now we bring)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
(Caroling, caroling now we go)  
It's Christmas  
(Joyous voices sweet and clear)  
(Sing the sad of heart to cheer)  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
Oh, caroling, caroling through the town  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling up and down  
Christmas are ringing  
Mark thee well the song that we sing  
Gladsome tidings now we bring  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Oh, caroling (caroling, caroling)  
We're caroling  
(Caroling, caroling)  
Through the town here we go  
(Caroling, caroling)  
And there's lots of our voices to cheer  
(Caroling, caroling)  
Sweet and clear  
Bells are ringing so fine  
It's a wonderful time of the year  
Far and near  
Oh caroling....
