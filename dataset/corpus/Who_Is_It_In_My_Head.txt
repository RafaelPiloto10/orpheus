I see a man without a problem  
I see a country always starved,  
I hear the music of a heartbeat,  
I walk, and people turn and laugh.  
  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is in my head here at the start?  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head, or in my heart?  
  
I pick up phones and hear my history.  
I dream of all the calls I miss.  
I try to number those who love me,  
And find exactly what the trouble is.  
  
Is it in my head etc.  
I feel I'm being followed,  
My head is empty  
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence.  
Make love to a stranger  
Just asking for directions  
Turn from being help to being questions.  
  
I see a man without a problem.
