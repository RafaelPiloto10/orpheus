Yo, yo, I want to give a shout-out  
  
to the world.  
  
This is Wyclef, cold-chillin'  
  
out here with my pina-colada.  
  
Yeah, baby.  
  
I'm in the islands, cold relaxin'.  
  
Right about now the carnival's  
  
gonna change phases.  
  
If you got your ticket, man,  
  
you're allowed to come with me.  
  
Yo, for right now I'm gonna  
  
chill in the beach,  
  
check out the pretty girls  
  
layin' back.  
  
You know how we do, playa yo.  
  
I'm out here in the sun, baby,  
  
it's all good!
