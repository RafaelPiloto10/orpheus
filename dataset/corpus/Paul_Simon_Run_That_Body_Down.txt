Went to my doctor yesterday  
She said I seem to be OK  
She said  
Paul you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down?  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Who you foolin?  
  
I came back home and I went to bed  
I was resting my head  
My wife came in and she said  
What's wrong sweet boy what's wrong?  
Ah, I told her what's wrong  
I said Peg you better look around  
How long you think you can  
Run that body down  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Now, who you foolin?  
  
Kid you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down?  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Who you foolin?
