I wasn't looking for a lover, I wasn't looking for a friend  
I wasn't working undercover, I wasn't trying to pretend  
But when you walked across the dance floor, just like the moon across the sky  
I knew that I would have to see more, I knew that I would have to try  
I look into your eyes and I realize  
  
Oh no, I can't stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again  
Won't someone save me?  
  
She jumped aboard the brown line, I accidentally caught her eye  
She told me she was born a Libra, and I told her I was Gemini  
She made suggestive conversation, then she lightly brushed my hand  
Overcome by her temptation, we jumped off down by the strand  
And in the English night, oh I realize it again  
  
Oh no, I can't stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again  
Won't someone save me?  
  
She asks me to come inside, we could just talk for a while  
I wonder if I should, but her touch, her touch, it feels so good.  
I look into your eyes, and I realize it again.  
  
Oh no, I can't stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again  
Won't someone save me?
