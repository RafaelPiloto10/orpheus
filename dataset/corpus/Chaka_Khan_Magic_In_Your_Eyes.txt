Say there is magic in his mind  
Reflecting in his eyes  
It's that mystery draws me to you  
This kind of voodoo's hard to find  
  
I detect a little gypsy in his smile  
I think I'll stay for awhile  
I need some lovin' it's my turn and  
I got a little fire left to burn  
  
Oh if he would just remain  
I'd show him how I could love him  
Or I get the feeling that he knows me  
From some other time before  
Wonder how he could forget me  
Can't explain why I'm comin' back for more
