Only yesterday they told me you were gone  
All these normal people, will I find another one?  
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones  
I forgot you said "One day you'll walk alone"  
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?  
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?  
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red  
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head!  
Who will help me up?  
Where's the helping hand?  
Will you turn on me?  
Is this my final stand?  
In a dream I cannot see  
Tangled abstract fallacy  
Random turmoil builds in me  
I'm addicted to chaos  
Light shined on my path  
Turn bad days into good  
Turn breakdowns into blocks, I smashed 'em 'cause I could  
My brain was labored, my head would spin  
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in  
The rain comes down, cold wind blows  
The plans we made are back up on the road  
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown  
Remember that you said  
"One day you'll walk alone"
