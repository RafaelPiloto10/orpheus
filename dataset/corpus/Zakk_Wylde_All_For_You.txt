My neck has been broken the noose of life's rope  
Through my loss of you I have found no hope  
Slain emotions, lifeless and blue  
Destroying myself now  
  
All for you  
All for you  
All for you  
  
Remote, recollections of tranquility  
Terror grotesquely becoming of me  
Unnameable joy when our blood once ran true  
Destroying myself now  
  
All for you  
All  
You  
All  
You  
All for you  
All for you  
  
All for you  
All for you  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you  
You, you, you, you
