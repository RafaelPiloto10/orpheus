You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Something's wrong  
Got a feeling that I don't belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place, like King Kong  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk, how to fall  
  
Can't complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Something's happening, I can't control  
Lost my hold, it's insane  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
You'll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh, that's o.k.!!  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refugee
