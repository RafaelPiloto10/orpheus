Loving you makes me a better man  
These things I don't know how to do  
But you make me think I can  
  
I've got a long way to go  
But I know what I know like the back of my hand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I've been wrong, more than I cared to say  
Time after time I've been lost  
Just couldn't find my way  
  
You shed a light on the path through the night  
Leading right to the side where I stand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I make mistakes, didn't have what it takes  
Just to walk out leave it alone  
I've got a long lot of heartaches that follow me home  
  
Time goes on and I watch you disappear  
I've got a mount to mount  
Now that I have you near  
  
You came to me and it's easy to see  
There's a line that I've crossed in the sand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
Loving you makes me a better man
