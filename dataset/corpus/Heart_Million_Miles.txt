If the 59 is gone  
That's the train that I am on  
You can hear the whistle blow a million miles  
  
I would give up all my life  
Trying to get it right  
I'm five million miles from my home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
If the 59 is gone  
That's the train that I am on  
You can hear the whistle blow a million miles  
  
I would give up all my life  
Trying to get it right  
I'm one million miles from home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home
