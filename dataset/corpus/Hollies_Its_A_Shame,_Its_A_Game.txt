Out last night in my Sunday stripes  
(You didn't want to know me)  
At the Tuesday hop if I wear drainpipes  
(You say you're gonna throw me)  
The way you treat me's frightening  
Strike me down like lightning  
You know it's a shame  
(You didn't want to know)  
It's a game  
(You say you're gonna throw me)  
Out of town there's a story 'round  
(You're staying with another)  
At the picture show so the rumor goes  
(You've been playing with my brother)  
I don't know where I'm standing  
You give me such a bumpy landing  
It's a shame  
(You're staying with another)  
It's a game  
(You've been playing with my brother)  
Getting a bad reaction  
Chasin' my girls best friend  
Wonder should I walk on home  
Plan a break-up or shake hands and make up again  
It's a shame  
It's a game  
(It's a a shame, it's a game)  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
I was out tonight looking wild in white  
(You didn't want to know me)  
Tried to catch a hint on how to jive  
(You didn't want to show me)  
I haven't got a dogs chance  
If I don't know how to hip-dance  
It's a shame  
(You didn't want to know me)  
It's a game  
(You didn't want to show me)  
I really felt hip wearing my stripes, baby it's a shame  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
And I really thought my drainpipes were outta sight, yeah, it's a shame  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
Well, you struck me down like lightning, baby, I didn't know what to do  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
There's so many rumors about me and about you, I don't know what to do  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
It's a shame, I don't know what to do, baby, I need ya  
(It's a shame, it's a game)  
Oh, c'mon and teach me how to hip jive
