Tuesday, 7:56 P.M.  
What's up, Jermaine? I miss you.  
Mmm.  
Do me a favor. Tell your friends you're not going out tonight.  
I got a little bit of that Christal, some of that Yak. And, oh. Better  
yet, I got on what you like to see in the most.  
Word!  
So, we're fucking tonight.  
Ha, ha, ha. For sure. Ha, ha.  
  
Uh, ha  
What you thinkin' about?  
You and me goin' one-on-one (say what)  
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)  
MC y'all (what you think about)  
I'm the man to fulfill your needs  
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (c'mon)  
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart  
If forever you'll be my sweetheart  
  
Boy, haven't you noticed (say what)  
The gleam in my eyes (uh, huh)  
Because of you  
I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)  
But every time you're with me (uh)  
Feel so positive  
That with you a little love  
Somethings gotta give  
  
A full moon is waiting in the twilight  
Maybe soon you will come to be my light  
Here we are  
Hoping that we'll never part  
Stay with me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)  
We can share a story book moment  
What you think about  
What you think about  
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one  
Just deep in love  
  
You ain't no Casanova (ha, ha, ha)  
I'll know that you'll be true  
And that's why (uh)  
I'm so in love with you (me, too)  
But this romantic evening  
You led me at my door (yeah, yeah)  
But tonight, I'd like to explore  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Verse 4:  
Na, na, na, na, na (say what)  
Na, na, na, na, na (like that)  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (bring it down, ooh)  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (putcha hand in the air)  
  
JD y'all  
MC y'all  
See, I saw you at the party  
With your eyes on me  
Fittin' the description  
On what I want my wife to be (ha, ha)  
As live as me  
Don't know the same guys as me  
But a lot of style  
And usin' wild name like Ivory  
I agree with my niggas  
You the baddest  
I ever seen in a long time (uh)  
But woman with her own shine  
Is her own time  
And I don't hit  
'cause I'm tired of dealin'  
With the wrong kind  
Getting non' but the bullshit  
She got a playa  
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)  
She up in the corner  
Sippin' Don P, Rosee' (yeah)  
Shakin' it up with the homegirls  
Payin' no attention to us  
They in they own world  
'Hey, yo, girl'  
I'm the man to fulfill your needs  
Get you everything you see in your dreams  
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart  
If forever you'll be my sweetheart  
  
Sounds so right (uh, huh)  
The mood is right  
Say what  
MC, baby, sing it to me  
To keep me warm  
Away from home  
Nowhere better than my baby's arms  
Sounds so right (uh, huh)  
The mood is right  
Say what  
MC, baby, sing it to me To keep me warm  
Away from home  
c'mon, baby, you can be my  
Won't you be my  
Sweetheart  
Sweetheart  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Mariah, you're on fire  
JD y'all  
You know I need your love roaming  
Yeah, yeah, me too  
All that shit
