Isn't it more the way you do it than the way that you look?  
Isn't it in the way you use it, not the lessons you took?  
Isn't it time you started asking what goes on in your mind?  
You won't take no for an answer  
Nobody could tell you your place  
They'd better not turn round and tell ya  
Even if it's straight to your face  
I ain't lonely but I'm happy if it makes you feel good  
But it's no way, it's a fool's way, it'll end up no good  
Isn't it more the way you do it than the way that you look?  
Isn't it in the way you use it, not the lessons you took?  
Isn't it time you started asking what goes on in your mind?  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I ain't gonna stop  
Baby I should have let you find it out, but in your own time  
So don't be scared of the future  
Everything is looking real fine  
I think my way's gonna suit ya  
But only if you're gonna stay mine  
And you could do, and you should do, it'll make you feel fine  
'cause the best way is the best way, and we'll make it on time  
Well I've been really, really wondering am I losing my mind?  
Why do we do the things we shouldn't do? We'd rather be fine  
We're in a sticky situation and you really don't mind.  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I ain't gonna stop  
Baby I should have let you find it out, but in your own time  
And you could do, and you should do, it'll make you feel fine  
'cause the best way is the best way, and we'll make it on time  
Isn't it more the way you do it than the way that you look?  
Isn't it in the way you use it, not the lessons you took?  
Isn't it time you started asking what goes on in your mind?  
This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not  
This is the way I gotta tell you and I ain't gonna stop  
We're in a sticky situation and you really don't mind
