You're just too good to be true  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
Oh, I wanna hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
  
I love you baby, and if it's quite all right  
I need you baby, you warm a lonely night  
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say  
I love you baby, don't let me down I pray  
I love you baby, now that I found you, stay  
And let me love you, baby let me love you
