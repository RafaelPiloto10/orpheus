[Chorus]  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
(Let's go)  
Saturday night Rainbow bar and grill  
Where there's Cocaine lines and a little white pill  
A beer and a gin, now I can't see straight  
Slip it in, no glove, oops too late  
I remember her face but forgot her name  
She forgot mine too ain't that a shame  
Smelled like reefer and my hairs in a mess  
I left my love running down her dress  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dave from Drowning Pool is here  
Steal's my women and he drinks my beer  
Buys me a pizza and a shot of Jim Beam  
And as who the fuck is Angeline  
I go to piss in the parking lot well  
I get in a fight but I don't get caught  
Hell no problem 'cause the nights still young  
I want a little more gonna get ya some  
  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
(CC lets go)  
  
Rock stars, movie stars, a Hollywood scene  
I eat dinner with Nick Cage and Charlie Sheen  
Nick asks me what the hell Unskinny Bop means  
It's slang for CC banging a porno queen  
  
Mario, Michael, Tony and Steady  
R.V. won't ya get table six ready  
My Platinum records hang all around  
Rainbow's home when I'm in this town  
  
[Chorus]
