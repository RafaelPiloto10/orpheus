Esther be the one that shoots a machine gun  
Whether you like it or not.  
Midnight or daylight, stay out of her sight  
'Cause I heard she's one heck of a shot.  
  
Esther be the one, she's the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.  
  
And you will feel her love bullets when you look her in the eyes.  
There ain't no way to escape.  
And that's when her fever will materialize,  
But it ain't no unfortunate fate.  
  
Esther be the one, she's the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.  
  
It ain't nothing, but it's something so dear  
Don't get branded, cause her ammo is real  
  
If she gets you in a corner, don't let her mess you 'round  
And don't let her blow you away.  
If you can't dig on Esther, you turn and leave town  
'cause if you think she's bad you ought to see her sister.  
  
Esther be the one, but she's not the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.
