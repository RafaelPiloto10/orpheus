Is it a mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear?  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
Is it the way the dust clings to the air  
But you'd swear, you'd swear  
Is it a mean streak, a desolation sound?  
A copy of desire oh nothing's that far down  
A mean streak on a western swing  
On TV saying the damnedest thing  
Mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
It's the way the dust clings to the air  
After a stranger's been there, you'd swear, you'd swear  
Is it a mean streak to a certain degree?  
They come whistling down the crookedest street  
A mean streak in the ghost state  
Between the certain and the hesitating  
A mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
It's the way that dust clings to the air  
After the stranger's been here, you'd swear you'd swear  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
Sssh sssh sound of the bottoms of their boots  
On the tops of the grass  
As their hay wagon rolled past  
And I'd swear I'd swear  
The way the dust clings to the air  
After the stranger's been here  
I'd swear I'd swear  
That that was you there  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
I'd swear, I'd swear  
[Incomprehensible]
