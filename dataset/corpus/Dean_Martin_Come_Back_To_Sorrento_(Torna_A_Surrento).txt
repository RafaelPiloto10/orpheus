Sunlight dances on the sea  
Tender thoughts occur to me  
I have often seen your eyes  
In the nighttime when I dream  
  
When I pass a garden fair  
And the scent is in the air  
In my mind a dream awakes  
And my heart begins to break  
  
But you said goodbye to me  
Now all I can do is grieve  
Can it be that you forgot?  
Darling forget me not!  
  
Please don't say farewell  
And leave this heart that's broken  
Come back to Sorrento  
So I can mend
