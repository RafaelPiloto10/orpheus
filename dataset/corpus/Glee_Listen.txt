Listen  
To the song here in my heart  
A melody I start but can't complete  
  
Listen oooh  
To the sound from deep within  
It's only beginning to find release  
  
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard  
They will not be pushed aside and turned  
Into your own all 'cause you won't listen  
  
Listen  
I am alone at a crossroads  
I'm not at home in my own home  
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind  
You should have known -  
  
Oh  
  
Now I'm done believing you  
You don't know what I'm feeling  
I'm more than what you made of me  
I followed the voice you gave to me  
But now I've gotta find my own  
You should have listened  
  
There is someone here inside  
Someone I thought had died so long ago  
Oh, I'm free now and my dreams will be heard  
They will not be pushed aside or worse  
Into your own all 'cause you won't listen  
  
Listen  
I am alone at a crossroads  
I'm not at home in my own home  
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind  
You should have know  
  
Oh, now I'm done believing you  
You don't know what I'm feeling  
I'm more than what you made of me  
I followed the voice you gave to me  
But now I've gotta find my own  
  
I don't know where I belong  
But I'll be moving on  
If you don't, if you won't  
  
Listen  
To the song here in my heart  
A melody I start  
But I will complete -  
  
Oh, Oh  
  
Now I'm done believing you  
You don't know what I'm feeling  
I'm more than what you made of me  
I followed the voice you think you gave to me  
But now I gotta find my own  
My own
