Hmm, it's 'fore day in the mornin', babe,  
You ain't got home yet.  
I cried and cried  
'Til my pillow's soaking wet!

Hmmm, I can't get started  
Since you threw me down,

Hmmm, I loved you, baby,  
But you don't mean me no good.  
You give me so much trouble  
I believe I move from your neighborhood!
