I stumbled out of bed  
I got ready for the struggle  
I smoked a cigarette  
And I tightened up my gut  
I said this can't be me  
Must be my double  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember what  
I'm burning up the road  
I'm heading down to Phoenix  
I got this old address  
Of someone that I knew  
It was high and fine and free  
Ah, you should have seen us  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember who  
  
I'll be there today  
With a big bouquet of cactus  
I got this rig that runs on memories  
And I promise, cross my heart,  
They'll never catch us  
But if they do, just tell them it was me  
  
Yeah I loved you all my life  
And that's how I want to end it  
The summer's almost gone  
The winter's tuning up  
Yeah, the summer's gone  
But a lot goes on forever  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember what
