If there is music there  
I'll have to go  
Never been anything in my life that I wanted more  
This is my greatest fear  
That I'm loosing you my dear  
It's more than I want to give  
But if there is music there  
  
If there is music there  
I'll have to know  
Never met anyone who could take music out of my soul  
There's something deep inside  
That I no longer want to hide  
My love you would never share  
If there is music there  
  
It's not my fault  
I've done no wrong  
It's something that you've always known  
I tried to tell you all along  
It seems that heaven has a plan  
An extraordinary plan  
A reason for my soul  
For my soul  
  
If there music there  
I'll have to go  
Never found anyone who could take music out of my soul  
This is my greatest fear  
That I'm loosing you my dear  
It's more than I want to give  
It's more than my heart can bear  
I could be losing you  
If there music there  
  
Spoken:  
I'm so sorry, honey  
I've always loved you  
I do love you  
But I just have to go
