Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
It's okay if you're all right  
It's good to be here with you tonight  
Dressed in moonlight and faded jeans  
It ain't no mystery, all it means is  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
We'll be all right if it's ok  
I know I'm crazy but I'm naturally that way  
And by the look in your liquid eyes  
It won't come as any big suprise but  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
Everybody's in their own little world  
And I've been dreaming about you girl  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
I'm here with you, you're here with me  
Ain't it wonderful just how good it can be  
I don't imagine it gets much better than this  
But whatever it was it just got crossed off my list  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
Can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
Everybody's in their own little world  
And I've been dreaming about you girl  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight
