I desire I desire  
I pledge allegiance to the thought  
That your love is all that matters  
And your gestures have the power  
To bring the whole world to its knees  
  
Don't let me torment you  
Don't let me bring you down  
Don't ever let me hurt you  
Don't let me fail because  
  
I desire your attention  
I desire your perfect love  
I desire nothing more (than this)  
  
To give you happiness  
Could become a lifetime goal  
A smile I might bring you  
Is more important than world peace  
  
I pledge allegiance to the fact  
That you're wise to walk away  
For nothing is more dangerous  
Than desire when it's wrong
