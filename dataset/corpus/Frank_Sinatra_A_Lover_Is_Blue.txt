Yesterday we were gay,  
I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,  
You've gone, and so a lover is blue  
Life was sweet, so complete,  
Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken,  
Alone, and so a lover is blue  
Do you still remember our love affair,  
Does it matter to you,  
But I'll have to go through our door to care  
Here and there everywhere,  
Every scene just reminds me  
Of something that binds me  
To you, and so a lover is blue
