This a religion  
No, this a drag  
That man over there is smoking sweet cigarettes  
Hey look at that fag !  
  
I had a dream  
I saw you swim  
Sink to your grave  
Down to Davy Jone's locker  
Under the waves  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths"  
  
Take me to your leader  
Take me for a ride  
The shutters were never open  
The day I used to hide  
All of the things  
I never knew  
I should have said  
When you looked like Frida Kahlo  
Curled up in bed  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths "  
Don't drink the water, baby  
Don't drink the water, baby  
  
So much emotion, these eyes a strange kind of blue  
Deep as the ocean, they named a sea after you  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths "  
  
Don't drink the water, baby [Repeat: x4]
