It wasn't always like this  
It wasn't always so  
We did it in the darkness  
We did it in the cold  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
It's emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesn't count at all  
  
Bohemian boys and Brazilian girls  
Make familiar noise in a familiar world  
Its like a million beats in a Parisian heart  
(They're made of glass)  
  
Working the west with the girls from the east  
Working a sweat from a million beats  
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts  
(They're made of glass)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Like it knows my name)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Were made of glass)  
  
It wasn't always easy  
It wasn't always fun  
We intertwine naively  
But in the end we're one  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
It's emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesn't count at all  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Like it knows my name)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(They're made of glass)
