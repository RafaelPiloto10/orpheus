Wrapped tight around me  
Like a second flesh hot skin  
Cling to my body  
As the ecstasy begins  
  
Your wild vibrations  
Got me shooting from the hip  
Crazed and insatiable let 'er rip  
  
Eat me alive  
  
Sounds like an animal  
Panting to the beat  
Groan in the pleasure zone  
Gasping from the heat  
  
Gut-wrenching frenzy  
That deranges every joint  
I'm gonna force you at gun point  
  
To eat me alive  
  
Bound to deliver  
As you give and I collect  
Squealing impassioned  
As the rod of steel injects  
  
Lunge to the maximum  
Spread-eagled to the wall  
You're well equipped to take it all  
  
So eat me alive
