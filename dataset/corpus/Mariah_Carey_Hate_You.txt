Ah... Ahh... Ahh...  
Ahh... Ahh...  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...  
  
La la la... Ahh... Ahh... Ooh...  
Ahh... Ooh...  
  
Once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye  
Something got a hold of us and we changed  
Then you sat alone in pride  
And I sat at home and cried  
How'd our fairytale just end up this way  
  
We went round for round 'till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound  
And if that's a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you...  
Uh uh uh... Ah ah ah ahhhhh...  
  
Oh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain  
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again  
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night...  
Wanna pause it, but I can't make it stay  
(Just gotta let it play)  
  
We went round for round 'till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound  
And if that's a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a loss cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you...  
Uh uh uh... Ah ah ah ahhh...  
  
No need to call my phone cause I changed my number today  
A matter a fact I think I'm moving away (away)  
Sorry, the frustration's got me feeling that way  
And I just keep having one last thing to say  
And I just wanna hold you, touch you,  
Feel you, be near you, I miss you baby baby baby...  
I'm tired of trying to fake through  
But there's nothing I can do...  
Boy I can't wait to hate you...  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you... Baby...  
Ah ah ah ahhhhh...  
  
I can't wait to H. A. T. E. You  
'Cause right now I need you  
Can't wait to make you go (go) (repeat to end)
