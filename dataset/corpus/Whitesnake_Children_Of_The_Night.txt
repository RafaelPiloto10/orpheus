I'm getting ready  
I'm in the mood to fool around  
It's time for action  
Now the boys are back in town  
  
So turn up the music,  
Make it loud and proud  
Let's see reaction  
Let the spotlight hit the crowd  
  
Don't hide what you feel inside,  
Don't let anybody stand in your way,  
Just let the music take you higher  
  
Now are you ready to rock,  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll,  
Children of the night  
  
You got the power,  
I feel your fire in my soul  
You got the fever,  
'Cause you were born to rock an' roll  
Don't run for cover,  
I'm gonna show you what I've learned  
Just come a little closer,  
Come on an' get your fingers burned  
  
Don't hide what you feel inside,  
Don't let anybody stand in your way,  
Just let the music take you higher.  
  
Now are you ready to rock,  
Are you ready to roll,  
Are you ready to rock  
  
Now are you ready to rock,  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll,  
Children of the night  
  
I'm getting ready,  
I'm in the mood to fool around  
It's time for action,  
'Cause now the boys are back in town  
  
Don't hide what you feel inside,  
Don't let anybody stand in your way,  
Just let the music take you higher.  
  
Now are you ready to rock,  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll,  
Children of the night  
  
Are you ready to rock,  
Children of the night  
Are you ready to roll,  
Children of the night  
  
Are you ready to rock,  
Are you ready to roll,  
Children of the night  
  
Just let the music take you higher
