Me no bubbletious  
Me smoke heavy tar  
Me be groovin' slowly  
Where you are  
Notify your next of kin  
'Cause you're never coming back  
I've been dropping beats  
Since Back in Black  
And we'll paint by numbers  
'Til something sticks  
Don't mind doing it for the kids (So come on)  
Jump on board  
Take a ride (yeah) (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high  
'Cause the kids are alright  
  
You've got a reputation  
Well I guess that can be explored  
You're dancing with  
The chairman of the board  
Take a ride on my  
Twelve cylinder symphony  
But if you got other plans  
The purpose of a woman  
Is to love her man  
  
And we'll paint by numbers  
Till something sticks  
Don't mind doing it for the kids (So come on) jump on board  
Take a ride (yeah) (Doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high  
'Cause the kids are alright  
  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
  
Come down from the ceiling  
I didn't mean to get so high  
I couldn't do what I wanted to do  
When my lips were dry  
You can't just up and leave me  
I'm a singer in a band  
Well I like drummers baby  
You're not my bag  
  
Jump on board  
Take a ride, yeah (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high, yeah  
  
Jump on board  
Take a ride, yeah (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high, yeah  
  
I'm an honorary  
Sean Connery, born '74  
There's only one of me  
Single-handedly  
Raising the economy  
Ain't no chance of the  
Record company dropping me  
Press be asking do  
I care for sodomy  
I don't know, yeah, probably  
I've been looking  
For serial monogamy  
Not some bird that  
Looks like Billy Connolly  
But for now  
I'm down for ornithology  
Grab your binoculars  
Come follow me
