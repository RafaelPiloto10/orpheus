A very pleasant good evening ladies and gentlemen  
It is now time  
The one and only  
There never will be another  
Christina Aguilera  
That's how music should sound  
  
Oh yeah  
I've waited for some time  
To get inside the minds  
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside  
It's like an endless ride  
Feeling the lows and highs  
Of every lyric and melody  
Every single rhyme  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength  
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith  
In his good faith  
  
I'm going back to basics  
To where it all began  
I'm ready now to face it  
I wanna understand  
What made the soul singers  
And the blues figures  
That inspired a higher generation  
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers  
They gave so much of themselves and dedication  
  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
  
Oh yeah  
Hey ha
