The brightest star on a cloudless night  
Some kind of miracle, almost empty sky  
Infact as sure as God is a monkey's dream  
And ate that mushroom and believe what he sees  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Sittin' warmin' your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is you're always lookin way outside (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
  
Just as the bite of the blade wakes the absent mind  
There's time to dream and there's time to open your eyes  
She said, just as the warmth of a kiss brings the love alive  
It's right here by the fire where the answers lie  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Oh when you're warmin' your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is you're always lookin' far and wide (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
  
She said why you always lookin', always lookin'?  
She said why you always lookin' outside?  
She said  
  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' for the fire  
When you're warmin' your hands by the fireside  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' far and wide (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside? (way outside)  
  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' somewhere else (way outside)  
Oh then what you see there beside yourself  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' for the fire (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
She said, oh why not enjoy yourself sittin' by the fire?  
She said  
The trouble with you  
The trouble with you
