Lord, Help me walk  
Another mile, just one more mile,  
I'm tired of walkin' all alone.  
  
Lord, Help me smile  
Another smile, just one more smile,  
I know I just can't make it on my own.  
  
I never thought I needed help before,  
I thought that I could do things by myself.  
Now I know I just can't take it any more.  
With a humble heart, on bended knee,  
I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.  
  
Come down from Your golden  
Throne to me, to lowly me,  
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand.  
  
Remove the chains of darkness  
And let me see, Lord let me see,  
Just where I fit into your master plan.  
  
I never thought I needed help before,  
I thought that I could do things by myself.  
Now I know I just can't take it any more.  
With a humble heart, on bended knee,  
I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.
