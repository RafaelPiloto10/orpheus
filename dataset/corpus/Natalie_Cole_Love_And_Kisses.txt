Hmm, talking on the telephone early in the morning dawn, softly singing in
your ear  
A song that I wrote last night, it's so very hard my dear, you are there  
And I am here, somehow words I try to say, they just don't seem to sound right  
  
Conversation's getting thin and my patience is too, I gotta go, I'll call you
when  
My show is through, oh, hello operator, give me a little more time  
In the meantime get my baby on the line, please, in the meantime  
  
Get my baby on that line, I'm sending love and kisses on the telphone wire  
I hope he gets them in time, hmm, hmm, love and kisses across the Pacific  
Gonna send them to that baby of mine, yeah, gonna send them to that baby of
mine  
  
(How you doing...) Sure do miss ya, I'd like to kiss ya  
(What...) What's that you said my dear, this connection's not so clear  
But if you said I love you, then you know that I feel the same way  
  
Hope the kids are doing fine, do they still get to school on time  
Oh by the way, I really miss your face around about supper time  
Conversation's gettin thin and my patience is too, gotta go  
  
I'll call you when my show is through, I'm sending love and kisses  
On the telephone wire, I hope he gets them in time  
Oh, love and kisses across the Pacific, gonna send them to that baby of mine  
Hmm, gonna send them to that baby of mine  
Oh, love and kisses, ooh, ooh, love and kisses
