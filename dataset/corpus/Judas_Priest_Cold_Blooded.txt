[Verse:]  
I have no face, I have no mind  
I have no senses left, you see I'm blind  
I feel no faith, I hear no truth  
The reason is I have, have uncome loose  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me  
  
[Verse:]  
I lay here numb, my conscience clear  
And all the dissesncy transfused to fear  
I feel no faith, I hear no truth  
The reason is I have, have uncome loose  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me  
  
[Bridge:]  
You suck my life and all I live for  
I left fortune cold logging envy here  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me
