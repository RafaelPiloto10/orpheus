Grandpa pissed his pants again  
He don't give a damn  
Brother Billy has both guns drawn  
He ain't been right since Vietnam  
  
"Sweet home Alabama"  
Play that dead band's song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long  
  
Daddy's doing Sister Sally  
Grandma's dying of cancer now  
The cattle all have brucellosis  
We'll get through somehow  
  
"Sweet home Alabama"  
Play that dead band's song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long  
  
I'm going down to the Dew Drop Inn  
See if I can drink enough  
There ain't much to country living  
Sweat, piss, jizz and blood  
  
"Sweet home Alabama"  
Play that dead band's song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long
