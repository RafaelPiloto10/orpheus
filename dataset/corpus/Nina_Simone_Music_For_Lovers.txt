There is music for lovers  
It to be found  
In the sound  
Of a sigh.  
And there's music for lovers  
In the hush-a-bye dreams  
Of a child.  
When the whole world discovers  
That love's the only thing worthwhile.  
Then there'll be music for everyone  
And the whole world will smile.  
In the willow tree  
Made for you and me  
There's a silver symphony of birds.  
When the poets rhyme  
In the summer time  
You'll hear melodies  
In the words.  
There is music for lovers  
It to be found  
In the stream  
Running wild.  
And there's music for lovers  
In the hush-a-bye dreams  
Of you child.  
When the whole world discovers  
That love is the only thing worthwhile  
There'll be music for everyone  
And the whole world will smile.
