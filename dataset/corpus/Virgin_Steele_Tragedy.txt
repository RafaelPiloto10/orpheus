Who's to say, who is to blame  
Who killed our love  
I can see the lines are drawn  
Broken hearts and broken dreams  
Drifting worlds apart  
The lies are old, the scars are warm  
I don't want to lose your love now babe  
'Cause I feel that's when I'm with you it's alright  
Then I fall for your touch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tragedy- a broken love  
Fallen dreams are on the ground  
Tragedy- our love is pain, oh babe our love is pain  
When you make love do you think of  
Does he looks like me, does he do the things I do  
A shattered glass, a broken rose  
Blood runs from my soul  
Still you wound but never slay  
It's so lonely, so lonely  
It's killing me babe...  
Everyday...  
Nothing left...  
Nothing left at all to say..
