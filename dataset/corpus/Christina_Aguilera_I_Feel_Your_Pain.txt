when i think of you i need you...  
when i dream of you at night i just hold my head up high..  
when i see you in the stars and i sit with you at night  
i will hold you in my arms and never let go  
  
chorus:  
  
you and i forever  
forever in mane  
forever in the sky even in the rain  
we will last forever  
i will not forget, i feel your pain  
  
when you come to my house  
and we talk and talk and talk  
i will cherish every word  
when we walk at night in the park  
i will always mark  
every spot you stepped on  
  
chorus:  
  
you and i forever  
forever in mane  
forever in the sky and even in the rain  
we will last forever  
i will not forget, i feel your pain  
  
remember........ i feel your pain.
