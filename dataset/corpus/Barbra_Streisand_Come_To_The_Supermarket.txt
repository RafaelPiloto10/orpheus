If you want a fancy fan  
Or a turkey born in turkey-stan  
Or a slave that's awf'lly african  
Or a teapot early ming,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
If you want to buy a kite  
Or a pup to keep you up at night  
Or a dwarf who used to know snow white  
Or a frog who loves to sing,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
They have: sunflow'are cakes, moonbeam cakes,  
Gizzard cakes, lizard cakes,  
Pickled eels, pickle snakes,  
Fit for any king,  
  
If you want a bust of jade  
Or an egg that's more or less decayed  
Or in case you care to meet a maid  
For a nice but naughty fling,  
  
Come to the supermarket,  
If you come on an ostrich, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
And see pe-  
King.  
  
If you want a gong to beat  
Or a rickshaw with a sassy seat  
Or a painting slightly indiscreet  
That is simply riveting,  
Come to the supermarket and see peking.  
  
Well, if you want some calico  
Or a gentle water buffalo  
Glow worm guaranteed to glow  
Or a cloak inclined to cling,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
They have bird's-nest soup, seaweed soup,  
Noodle soup, poodle soup,  
Talking crows with the croup,  
Almost anything.  
  
If you want to buy a saw  
Or a fish delicious when it's raw  
Or a pill to kill your moth'are-in-law  
Or a bee without a sting,  
  
Come to the supermarket,  
If you come on a turtle, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
If you come on a goose, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
And see  
Pe-  
King!
