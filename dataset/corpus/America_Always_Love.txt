(Matthew Caws, Ira Elliott and Daniel Lorca)  
  
To make a mountain of your life  
Is just a choice  
But I never learned enough  
To listen to the voice that told me..  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Don't wait till the finish line  
  
Slow demands come 'round  
Squeeze the air and keep the rest out  
It helps to write it down  
Even when you then cross it out  
  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Even when you are defied  
  
Self-directed lies  
I want to know what it'd be like to  
Aim so high above  
Any card that you get dealt you...  
  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Hate will get you  
  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs,  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs  
You said...  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
  
To make a mountain of your life  
Is just a choice  
But I never learned enough  
To listen to the voice that told me  
Always love... hate will get you every time  
Always love... hate will get you:  
  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs,  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs  
You said . . .  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
I...
