When I think of Lorelei, my head turns all around  
As gentle as a butterfly, she moves without a sound  
I call her on the telephone, she says be there by eight  
Tonight's the night she's movin' in and I can hardly wait  
  
The way she moves, ooh-ooh-ooh, I gotta say  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Oh baby, forever  
  
Her eyes become a paradise, she softly speaks my name  
She brightens every lonely night, no one's quite the same  
She calls me on the telephone, she says be there by eight  
Tonight's the night she's movin' in, it's time to celebrate  
  
The way she moves, ooh-ooh-ooh, I gotta say  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Baby, baby, forever  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever
