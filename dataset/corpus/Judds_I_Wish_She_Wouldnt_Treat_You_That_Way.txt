The way she treats you  
Is a dog gone crime  
I just get blue about it all the time  
Drives me crazy  
How she walks that line  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way baby  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
I ain't sayin' that she's bad to you  
She does every little thing a lover should do  
Any fool could see that her love is true  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way baby  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
She ain't the only one  
Who loves you dear  
She ain't the only one  
Who needs you near  
  
How am I ever goin' to have my day  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
See you walkin' with her  
Hand in hand  
By the look on your face  
You're a happy man  
She's ruinin all of my best laid plans  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way baby  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way baby  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
She ain't the only one  
Who loves you dear  
She ain't the only one  
Who needs you near  
  
How am I ever goin' to have my day  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way  
  
Wish she wouldn't treat you that way baby  
I wish she wouldn't treat you that way
