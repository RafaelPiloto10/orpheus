I'll go back to Manhattan,  
As if nothing ever happened.  
When I cross that bridge,  
It'll be as if this don't exist.  
Have a prince who is waiting,  
And a kingdom downtown.  
I'll go back to Manhattan,  
As if nothing ever happened  
  
Don't have to speak at all.  
One look in your eyes,  
And I won't have to fall,  
Don't have to speak at all.  
  
Brooklyn holds you  
And holds my heart too.  
What a fool I was to think  
I could live in both worlds.  
  
Don't have to speak at all.  
One look in your eyes,  
And I won't have to fall,  
Don't have to speak at all.  
  
I should go back to Manhattan,  
It's just a train ride away.  
I know nothing about leaving,  
But I know I should do it today.
