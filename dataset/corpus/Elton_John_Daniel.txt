Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
Oh it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes  
  
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been  
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen  
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough  
I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much  
  
Daniel my brother you are older than me  
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died, cuz' you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star in the face of the skies  
  
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
Oh I miss Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes.
