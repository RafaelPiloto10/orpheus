If you think, you can depend on me  
Your right, you can  
If you think, that I'm in love with you  
Your right, I am  
But nuthin' lasts forever  
All good thing's must end  
And it's only, a matter, of time  
Day after forever  
I'm out that door  
One way or the other  
To return never more  
Don't count on me baby  
For I will be gone  
Day after forever  
Honey, you're on your own  
If you think, I love you more than life  
You're right, I do  
If you think, your in my heart and soul  
Your right, it's true  
But I must leave you someday  
Although I worship you  
And it's only, a matter, of time  
Day after forever  
I'm out that door  
One way or the other  
To return never more  
Don't count on me baby  
For I will be gone  
Day after forever  
Honey, you're on your own  
Day after forever  
Honey, you're on your own
