I lie alone and thinking,  
How could this ever happen?  
Is it real am I dreaming?  
And when your hearts been burnt,  
How can someone learn to get over their fears?  
You told me I should be strong,  
I'm trying I feel I can't go on,  
You left me here on my own,  
  
Without a reason for living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it ok.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me  
  
With all the time your taking,  
Slowly my hearts been breakin',  
You've been fine I've been bleeding,  
Ill have to wait my turn,  
Your respect ill earn,  
No more joking or teasing.  
  
You told me I should be strong,  
I'm trying I feel I can't go on,  
You left me here on my own,  
Without a reason 4 living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it okay.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me  
  
A thousand times before,  
I've been almost sure,  
This time i need to know,  
I've spent all my life,  
Chasing all my dreams,  
I'm not letting this go.  
  
Without a reason for living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it okay.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me
