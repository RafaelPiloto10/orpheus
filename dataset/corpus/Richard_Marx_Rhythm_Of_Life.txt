You say you'll get over it  
But I know you better  
Your feelings have been hurt a bit  
And you just can't forget her  
You'll want her back by tomorrow  
But she won't remember your name  
You better  
  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life  
  
You say that my soul is lost  
And that you're my savior  
You'll do anything at any cost  
To reform my behavior  
Didn't I make it this far  
By making up my own mind  
You gotta  
  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life
