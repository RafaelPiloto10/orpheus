From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah  
To California's golden shore  
Colorado and Nevada  
Through the deserts burnin' door  
While she's circlin' through the canyons  
Can't you see that mountain stream  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
See her rockin' see her rollin'  
As she rambles on her way  
She left L.A. this mornin'  
Burnin' up the right of way  
In the distance hear her moanin'  
Hear her lonesome whistle scream  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
She leaves the city of the angels  
Headin' for ole Santa Fe  
She's a makin' nauts, she's makin' time  
Just watch her swing and sway  
And from way out in the darkness  
See that headlight gleam  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah  
To California's golden shore  
Colorado and Nevada  
Through the deserts burnin' door  
While she's circlin' through the canyons  
Can't you see that mountain stream  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen
