[Verse 1]  
For all the times that you rain on my parade  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness' sake  
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Bridge]  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself
