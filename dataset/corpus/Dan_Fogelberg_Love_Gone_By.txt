Try your best to see through the confusion  
Seems the more you see  
The less you try  
You don't know what's real and what's illusion  
If you don't know by now then how should I?  
(I've been thinking 'bout the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.  
  
Give me back my heart  
And call it even  
Ain't no use in figuring who's to blame  
Once I thought this love was made in heaven  
Now I think it's just a crying shame.  
(And I've been thinking 'bout the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.  
  
Winners never know the worth of losing  
'Til the prize has slipped right through their hands  
Love will take a heart of its own choosing  
And break it if you try to understand.  
(We're left with nothing but the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.
