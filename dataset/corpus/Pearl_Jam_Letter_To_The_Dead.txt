Every photograph is peeling  
The colors turn to gray, this day  
There is always memories for days, these days  
An undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced  
By the loss of one he could not replace  
And there's no reason that she'd pass  
And there is no god with the plan, it's sad  
And his holiness is proof, it's said  
He could only know how you have sinned  
The world swings through a passing fable  
A fate we made a way, we say  
Holding on, live within our own ways  
He lit a match, he laid in bed  
Hoping their dreams will bring her back, it's sad  
And his holiness is proof, they said  
He could only love you, it's said  
Oh in his last breath, believing  
He'll make his way  
If she's not forgotten  
He's haunted  
He's searching for escape  
If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent  
And his holiness is proof, it's said  
He will always love you, he said
