I heard that payback's a mother fuckin' bitch  
But I won't stress and I won't switch  
And I would not take my life  
Glory please my God the only thing on my mind  
Takes up all of my time  
And I said ooh!  
Running from a gun  
Or some brain that ways a ton  
And my God it hurts to get so low  
Searchin' through the cars  
Cold still searchin' through the night  
I think I will run to you but I refuse to fuss and fight  
  
And God may find a reason  
Well I'm sure you'll find a rhyme  
Because it takes up nearly all my time  
He who stands for freedom  
God knows I've got the number  
But maybe I just use too much  
  
I was sitting in that bar  
Now I'm sittin' in that stolen car  
Cold, still rollin' down the boulevard  
Saw you with a gleam  
And the microphone scene  
Think I will run, to you  
But I know I won't live for me  
Cause I know God's got both, the reason and the rhyme  
Please tell me, why he takes up all my time  
I've been drinking, just like you  
And baby, you've got something I can use  
  
Payback's a mother fuckin' blast  
But I won't stress and I won't blast  
And I would not take my life  
Glory please, my God, comin' from heaven above  
Takes up all of my time  
And I said  
  
(Why must I feel like that?)  
  
Running from a gun  
And some brain that ways a ton  
You know, I did that line for Flava' Flav  
  
But, all the D.J.'s do it  
All the D.J.'s use it  
I would run, I would switch  
But I want to be the same  
And I know I'll find a reason  
Cause I always bust a rhyme  
Because it takes up nearly all my time  
The "T" hear stands for treason  
The "D" hear stands for dove  
And maybe I just use too,  
Maybe I'm just used too much  
And maybe I just use too much.
