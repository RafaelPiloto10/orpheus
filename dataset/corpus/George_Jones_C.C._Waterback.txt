CC Waterback one tequila sunrise  
One's for my aching head the other's for my bloodshot eyes  
Last night I let it all hang out I guess that's how my head got sore  
CC Waterback I can't stand the pain no more  
  
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones' place  
For fun and games and booze and things I guess I must drunk a case  
But that lady of mine drank warm red wine til she couldn't even find the door  
She wound up on the Jones' bed and I wound up on the floor
