Can't say I've found out  
I can't tell you  
What it's all about  
Don't know who does  
Tell you to  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Oh, oh, oh  
No, no, no  
I must be wrong, baby, yeah  
But I don't believe  
That he's the one  
But you insist  
I must be wrong  
I must be wrong  
I have to leave  
And when I'm gone  
I'll leave my message  
In my song, that's right  
Beware, my love  
Well, he'll bowl you over  
Beware, my love  
Before you're much older  
Hey, he'll sweep you up  
Under his carpet  
You'd be in luck  
If you could stop it  
Come on, now  
Beware, my love  
Let me tell you  
Well, he'll wear you out  
And in a minute  
You'll hear a shout  
And then you'll be in it  
So, so now beware my love  
'Cause he'll take you under  
Beware, my love  
The sound of his thunder  
Yeah!  
I don't believe  
That he's the one  
But if you insist  
I must be wrong  
I must be wrong  
But I have to leave  
And when I'm gone  
I'll leave my message  
In my song, that's where I'm gonna leave it, baby  
Come on  
Beware, my love  
Don't you know  
He'll bowl you over  
Beware, my love  
Before you're much older  
He's gonna  
Yeah, he's gonna wear you out  
When in a minute  
You'll hear a shout  
And then you'll be in it  
Baby gonna be there  
Yeah, beware  
Yoah I'll be there  
Oh, baby, beware  
Beware, beware, my love  
Yeah, any minute, oh

If I can stand it anymore  
'Cause I'm just gonna say to you  
My love, that you better be there  
Can't say, I've found out

Beware my love  
Beware my love

Beware my love  
Beware my love
