Thought I was asleep  
Lost to dreams  
I was dying in a big machine  
Didn't think the voice that called me  
Could be real.  
  
Thought I woke up  
Lost my faith  
I was staring at the face of rage  
Didn't think I'd see the demon in "His" heart  
  
Thought I saw blood  
Turn to wine  
A vision from the angel wars  
Didn't think I'd find the savior in the dark  
  
Thought I saw a light  
Tear the storm  
Showing me the way to God  
Didn't know that Heaven died and went to Hell  
  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed are shadows and pain  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed is death in "His" name  
  
Thought I saw rain  
Black and cold  
Falling on a child's grave  
Thought I saw an angel laugh and piss on it  
  
Thought I saw a dance  
Strange and cruel  
Swaying to the screams of men  
Thought I saw the Lord's disciples laugh at that  
  
Thought I saw love  
Sacrificed  
Mary under three wise men  
Thought I saw the Virgin look at me and cry  
  
Thought I saw a cross  
And Jesus dead  
Burning in the midnight sky  
Thought I saw God dancing in the flames  
  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is shadows and pain  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is death in "His" name  
  
"Do you confess?"  
"Cleanse your sin"  
"Do you believe in the word of God?"  
  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to shadows and pain  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to death in "His" name
