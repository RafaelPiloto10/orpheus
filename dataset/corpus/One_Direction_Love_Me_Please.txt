Baby, baby, oh baby  
Will you love me back  
Like I love you-you-you  
Like I love you-you-you  
You make me crazy  
Thinking about you daily  
But I love you baby  
Baby, baby, oh baby  
Will you love me please

On my own fe-ee-t  
Tryin to get you baby  
Will you love me back  
You make me so crazy  
Thinkin bout you daily-y  
Oh love me pleeease  
Love me like I love you-you-you  
Love me please
