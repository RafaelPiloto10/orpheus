I found myself at your door, just like all those times before  
But I'm not sure how I got there  
All roads, they lead me here  
I imagine you are home, in your room, all alone  
And you open your eyes into mine and everything feels better  
  
Right before your eyes I'm breaking  
No past, no reasons why  
Just you and me  
  
This is the last time I'm asking you this  
Put my name at the top of your list  
This is the last time I'm asking you why  
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye  
  
You find yourself at my door, just like all those times before  
You wear your best apology  
But I was there to watch you leave  
And all the time to let you in, just for you to go again  
Disappear when you come back  
Everything is better  
  
And right before your eyes I'm aching  
Run fast, nowhere to hide  
Just you and me  
  
This is the last time I'm asking you this  
Put my name at the top of your list  
This is the last time I'm asking you why  
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye  
  
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong  
This is the last time I say it's been you all along  
This is the last time I let you in my door  
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore, ohh  
  
This is the last time I'm asking you this  
Put my name at the top of your list  
This is the last time I'm asking you why  
You break my heart in the blink of an eye  
  
This is the last time I'm asking you this (This is the last time I'm asking
you this)  
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)  
This is the last time I'm asking you why (This is the last time I'm asking you
why)  
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)  
  
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you, last time I'm
asking you this  
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you, last time I'm
asking you this  
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you, last time I'm
asking you this  
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you, last time I'm
asking you this
