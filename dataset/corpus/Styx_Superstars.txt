You've read about me in the papers  
You've seen me on the movie screen  
You know everything about me  
I'm your late night fantasy  
  
But don't think I can't hear you calling  
From the shadow of the 14th row  
Cause I've had the same dreams you've had  
A few short years ago and that's why I know  
  
You and I  
We will climb so high  
Superstars  
Whoa whoa you and I  
  
And we'll just close our eyes  
And we'll become our fantasy  
  
Superstars yes, yes, superstars  
Step right this way. Everyone's welcome,  
We want your dreams.  
The offer's simple, momentary immortality  
  
Cause I've seen them all you know  
I've seen them climb and I've seen them fall  
I've seen them come and I've seen them go  
And through it all there's only one thing that matters  
  
Love  
And that's simply  
You and I  
Yes, You and I  
For we are superstars
