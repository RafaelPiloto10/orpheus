Everything that you know is as wrong as the next  
So you hold on to something and hope for the best  
And you know that it's right 'til you find that it's left  
And I'm doing the same and I have to confess  
  
That I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
All my senses are pushing the whole other way  
I can't see where to look now what's that that you say?  
It's a beautiful world it's a beautiful day  
And I wish I could say if I was feeling the same  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
I need an Obi-wan to tell me if I've gone astray  
  
And I wish it was clearer to see  
If you are what you're made out to be  
But there's no guarantee if you're you and I'm me  
And there never will be, 'til I can see what you see  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be  
Know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be
