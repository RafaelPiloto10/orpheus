From Russia with love I fly to you  
Much wiser since my goodbye to you  
I've travelled the world to learn  
I must return from Russia with love  
  
I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment  
But oh, you haunted me so  
Still my tongue tied, young pride  
Would not let my love for you show  
In case you'd say no  
  
To Russia I flew but there and then  
I suddenly knew you'd care again  
My running around is through  
I fly to you, from Russia with love
