I'm going down to see my highway girl she just back from around the world  
I'm gonna get me a gun, I'm gonna stand on guard  
In a little white booth in her front yard  
  
Throwing rocks at her window what could she do if I throw enough rocks  
One might break through well she looked out her  
Window when the police came to see a big tin man dancing in the rain  
  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl  
  
She said, don't you think babe you push a bit too fast I said,  
Slowing down don't make it last and a memory's never gonna set  
You free go out and see that world and bring it home to me  
  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl
