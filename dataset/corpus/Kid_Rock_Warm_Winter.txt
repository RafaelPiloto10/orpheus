Ha  
You took my friends away, Yeah  
You got them livin' for the grave  
Now everything's been fine since you been gone  
But you made my winter's feel so warm  
I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born  
  
Yeah  
See the suckers come down  
It's alright  
Mother Fucker  
Come see  
  
You played my soul for your fucking fool  
Yeah down in the beat  
You took my life and turned it around  
But you made my winter's feel so warm  
I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born  
  
Yeah  
See the suckers come down  
It's alright
