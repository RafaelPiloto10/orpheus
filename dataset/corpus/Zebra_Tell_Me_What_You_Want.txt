I've been wasting my time  
I am losing my mind  
My head's on the floor  
For evermore  
I have given you all  
All that I had  
But with a slam of the door  
You've driven me mad  
Now I'm sad  
Tell me what you want  
  
You have taken it all  
All of my love  
Unrelenting you told  
You told me a lie  
So I can cry  
There aren't words for it all  
All that I feel  
With the palm of your hand  
You crushed me for real  
Now what's the deal  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
I'm wishing to God you're gonna say you miss me  
I'm crossing my fingers that you say you're gonna kiss me  
I'm wishing to God you're gonna say you miss me  
I've got my fingers crossed you'll kiss me one more time  
  
So I can say I ain't been wasting my time  
I am losing my mind  
My head's on the floor  
For evermore  
I have given you all  
All that I had  
But with the slam of the door  
You've driven me mad  
Now I'm sad  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
I need you so bad  
You got to tell me, tell me what you want..
