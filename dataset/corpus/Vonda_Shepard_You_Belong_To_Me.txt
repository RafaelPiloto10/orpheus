See the pyramids along the Nile  
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle  
Just remember that all the while  
You belong to me  
  
See the market place in old Algiers  
Send me photographs and souvenirs  
Just remember when a dream appears  
You belong to me  
  
I'll be so lonesome wothout you  
Maybe you'll be lonesome, too  
And blue  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me  
Maybe you'll be lonesome, too  
  
And blue  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
  
You belong to me  
Maybe you'll be lonesome, too  
And blue  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me
