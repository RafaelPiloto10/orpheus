(Barry Reynolds, Marianne Faithfull)  
  
What does a woman need from a man ?  
Notches on her belt ?  
But any way to understand  
What isn't known but only felt  
  
Well it's a strange world we're living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well it's a strange world, not giving in  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Why take it lying down ?  
Who told you life was fair ?  
Just leave yourself in the lost and found  
It doesn't matter where  
  
But it's a strange world and it's alright  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well it's a strange world but not tonight  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Who do you pretend to be doing it for  
Doing it for ?  
  
What does a woman need from a man ?  
Notches on her belt ?  
But any way to understand  
What isn't known but only felt  
  
Well it's a strange world we're living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
No change there, not giving in  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Oh sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Oh sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for ?
