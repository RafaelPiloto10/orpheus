I stood on faith and the corner of ambition  
I came here to sink or swim  
And to show them all that they were wrong  
And though I never thought I'd make it this far  
  
So the curtains are down  
For the moment I'm someone  
There were those in the wings who waited,  
Who came this way  
Now there gone  
But there's always someone at home  
Who never forgets who you are  
  
When I'm down and I'm growing old  
I won't be along no railroad track  
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home  
  
When I'm down and I'm growing old  
I won't be along no railroad track  
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home  
  
Can't go on,  
I'm on the top of my better years  
I'm going home,  
It's too lonesome on the bottom rung here  
  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home
