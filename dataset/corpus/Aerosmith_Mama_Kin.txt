It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy.  
Tell ya, honey, how I feel.  
I've been dreaming,  
Floatin' down stream and  
Losin' touch with all that is real.  
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover  
Never knowin' where ya been.  
You've been fadin', always out paradin'.  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
  
Well you've always got your tail on the wag.  
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon.  
You act like a perpetual drag.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.  
The way I see it, you've got to say shit.  
But don't forget to drop me a line.  
  
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen.  
And workin' for you dad is just a drag.  
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.
