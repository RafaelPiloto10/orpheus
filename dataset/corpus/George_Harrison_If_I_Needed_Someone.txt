If I needed someone to love  
You're the one that I'd be thinking of  
If I needed someone  
  
If I had some more time to spend  
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
  
Had you come some other day then  
It might not have been like this  
But you see now I'm too much in love  
  
Carve your number on my wall and  
Maybe you will get a call from me  
If I needed someone  
  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
  
If I had some more time to spend  
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
  
Had you come some other day then  
It might not have been like this  
But you see now I'm too much in love  
  
Carve your number on my wall and  
Maybe you will get a call from me  
If I needed someone  
  
Aah, aah
