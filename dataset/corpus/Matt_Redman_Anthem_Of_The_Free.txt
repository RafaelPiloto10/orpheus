Hear the sound of the free  
Hear the cry of liberty  
We will rejoice in you  
We will rejoice  
As we sing of all you've done  
And the wonders of your love  
We will rejoice in you  
We will rejoice  
  
Rising up all around the earth  
Is a heavenly song of your endless worth  
Growing louder and louder and louder  
  
This is the anthem of the free  
This is the song of the redeemed  
Jesus, your praise is rising higher and higher and higher  
We'll sing it loud we'll sing it strong  
We'll sing it all around the world  
Jesus, your praise will last forever and ever and ever
