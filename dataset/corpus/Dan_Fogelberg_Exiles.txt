Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles, weary of the battles  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
You sit there and I sit here  
Looking at you used to be like looking in a mirror  
But now it's dark, no light reflects  
It never ends like one expects  
  
I don't know where we went wrong  
If I knew that I'd never had to write this song  
But here we stand so far apart  
Separate pieces of a broken heart  
  
We live like exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles, weary of the battles  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
You said you need time to think  
But I just couldn't go on living on the brink  
So now we take this frozen stance  
In hopes that we'll find one more chance  
  
Different wants and different needs  
Moving through our changes at such different speeds  
I don't know why and I don't know when  
But somewhere we'll find love again  
  
Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles looking for another day to make it all work out
