They said, "what do you think you would do  
If she told you that she'd been untrue? "  
I'd say, "i won't say I won't be sorry, no.  
It sure was love while it lasted. "  
  
They said, "how will you feel deep inside  
When the love you believed in has died? "  
I ain't sayin' it won't hurt me  
It sure was love while it lasted  
  
I'll be livin off of the good times  
That you've given me to face  
I have had my share of the sunshine  
I can stand a little rain.  
  
So we don't give a damn what they say  
We've go something they can't take away  
'cause whatever comes tomorrow  
It sure was love while it lasted  
  
It sure was good while it lasted  
It sure was love while it lasted.
