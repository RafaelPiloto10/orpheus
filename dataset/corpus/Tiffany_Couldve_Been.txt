The flowers you gave me  
Are just about to die  
When I think about  
What could've been  
It makes me want to cry  
  
The sweet words you whispered  
Didn't mean a thing  
I guess our song is over  
As we begin to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
Could've been so beautiful  
Could've been so right  
Could've been my lover  
Every day of my life  
Could've been so beautiful  
Could've been so right  
I'll never hold what could've been  
On a cold and lonely night  
  
The memories of our lovin'  
Still linger in the air  
Like the faded scent of your roses  
They stay with me everywhere  
  
Every time I get my hopes up  
They always seem to fall  
Still what could've been is better than  
What could never be at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could I hold what could've been  
On a cold and lonely night?
