Take away the moment  
That began the lonely night  
Take it away  
And you'll be back in my life  
'Cause I need you back in my life  
Take me back to the time  
When I could live in your light  
If that's the only way to live in your love  
Take me back  
If that's the way for me to live in your love  
Take me back  
  
If I must cling to someone  
Then you must be the someone  
On my own, on my way  
Lookin' back to the day  
Back to the day when I could live in your love  
Take me back  
I got to find a way to live in your love  
Take me back
