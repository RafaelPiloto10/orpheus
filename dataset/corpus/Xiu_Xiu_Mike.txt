Dad, what was Nigel supposed to do with your body?  
A life that I will never understand  
Whose false teeth were gently pushed back into your mouth by your daughter's
husband  
What am I supposed to do with this?  
I feel like I am not nice because sometimes  
It is hard for me to think something happy about you  
Except for that dad, I love you and I will always, always miss you  
Pull my finger
