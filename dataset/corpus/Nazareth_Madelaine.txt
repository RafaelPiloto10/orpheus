Standing watching a pale blue moon,  
Rising slowly in the winter sky,  
Waiting, hoping she'll be home soon,  
And I won't ask her where or why.  
  
As the evening shadows fall,  
Madelaine, Madelaine  
I can hear the night wind call,  
Call her name, Madelaine.  
  
Turning slowly I hear her call,  
Echo softly through the silver pines,  
Walking home the first snowflake falls,  
Still, she's always on my mind.  
  
As the evening shadows fall,  
Madelaine, Madelaine  
I can hear the night wind call,  
Call her name, Madelaine.
