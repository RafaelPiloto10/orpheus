Down, down under earth goes another lover  
Down, down under earth goes another lover  
  
Twelve times put a hex on you  
Small mouths don't dare to shout out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  
  
Twelve times put a hex on you  
Small mouths don't dare to shout it out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  
  
Run away, run away  
That you'll stay here  
On your own, on your own you're not safe (run away, run away)  
On your own, on your own you're not safe  
  
Down, down under earth goes another lover  
Down, down under the earth goes another lover  
Milk you for what you're worth and call it murder  
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
