When will he call me?  
When will it ring?  
Sometimes I think my sanity is hangin' by a shoestring  
  
When will he call me?  
How long is soon?  
Should I check my watch, my calendar or phases of the moon?  
  
And he doesn't have to call me  
He can e-mail me or text me  
My love is hanging by the phone is really vex me  
i check my messages you know how it affects me  
cause finding nothing in my inbox  
really hurts me  
  
When will he call me?  
(Oh woah!)  
When will he call me?  
When will he call me?  
Should I check my watch, my calendar or phases of the moon?
