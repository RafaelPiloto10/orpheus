He was selling an old guitar at a bar  
I saw her smiling picture in his wallet  
He said "I call her 'baby' but her Christian name is Charlotte"  
  
She spends her days downtown hooked up to some machine  
The say time can heal but time can't heal everything  
The Lord's gonna take her home real soon flying on angel's wings  
  
I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay  
We're all gonna die someday  
You won't remember a single word I'm trying to say  
  
It's all a grand illusion when you think you're in control  
She's all I got left of sellin' everything I own  
There's no good in a goodbye it's the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing 'em good my friend  
  
This old guitar and case has been in a million bars  
Been a fools disciple miss dance recitals  
And the birth of every child  
Honestly honesty never goes out of style  
So sing the pain my friend  
  
So the world she's her as just desperate grey and old  
All I see is my true love my heart my life my soul  
At least for one more night, I got a beautiful wrinkled hand to hold  
So sing the truth my friend  
  
I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay  
We're all gonna die someday  
You won't remember a single word I'm tryin' to say  
  
It's all a grand illusion when you think you're in control  
She's all I got left of selling everything I own  
There's no good in a goodbye it's the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing 'em good my friend  
  
I'm gonna sing the pain I'm in  
I'm gonna sing the truth within  
I'm gonna sing them good for my old friend  
  
Well I cried when I got in my truck so I put on my shades  
Looked up at the crimson sky as the sun began to fade  
And for the first time in a long time I swear  
I think I prayed  
  
I'm gonna sing the pain I'm in  
I'm gonna sing the truth within  
I'm gonna sing them good for my old friend  
Yeah my old friend
