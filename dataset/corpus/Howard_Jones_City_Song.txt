It was that night at nowhere,  
I saw you standing there  
Darlin' you were hungry for life,  
an innocent in this land  
  
What is it about this city,  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating,  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
You mustn't think of staying,  
The price is more than you'd think  
It's giving up the sweetest part of you,  
For this heartless prize  
  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating,  
they're acting it out for real  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
When they want some lovin'  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
when they feel like cryin'  
  
It was that night at nowhere,  
a cold glass in your hand  
Darlin' you were angry with life,  
a prisoner in this land  
  
What is it about this city,  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating,  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
When they want some lovin'  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
when they feel like cryin'  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
there's no sanctuary  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to handshake, nowhere to smile  
Won't you talk with me  
Spend some time and give me life  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
there's no sanctuary  
  
A vision of heaven  
A vision of heaven
