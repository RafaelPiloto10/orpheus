Money don't grow on a money tree  
The more you take the less for me  
Money don't buy what you really need  
It make an iceman cry, a stoneman bleed  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter who you are  
It rules your life like a virgin queen  
One day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It rules the world like a green machine  
  
In the bank, in a box, money talks  
In the black, on the rocks, money talks, money talks  
  
Money don't lose in the money game  
It drags you down like a ball and chain  
So money don't come with a guarantee  
It make a fool of you, it make a fool of me  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you say  
It ties you down but it can set you free  
Some day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It burns you up in the first degree  
  
Moscow, Bangkok, money talk  
Park Lane, Boardwalk, money talk  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you try  
You deal the cards, give the wheel a spin  
One day you might get over it but everybody knows  
It's heads you lose and it's tails they win  
Don't have too much to show for it, that's the way it goes  
You roll the dice and they cash you in  
  
Pinball, jukebox, money talks  
Redskins, White Sox, money talks  
Billboard, Cash box, money talks
