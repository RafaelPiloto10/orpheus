Well my pad is very messy, got whiskers on my chin  
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent  
I got no time for lovin'  
'Cause my time is all used up  
  
I stand outside creatin'  
All the groovy kinds of love  
I'm a man, yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man, yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
  
If I had my choice of matter  
I'd would rather be with cats  
All engrossed in mental chatter  
Showing where your mind is at  
  
While relating to each other  
How strong the love can be  
By resisting all the good times with each groovy chick we see  
  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I've got to keep my image  
While I'm standing on the floor  
  
If I drop upon my knees  
It's just to keep them on my nose  
You think that I'm not human  
And my heart is made of stone  
  
But I've never had no problems  
'Cause my body's pretty strong  
  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
  
If I had my choice of matter  
I would rather be with cats  
All engrossed in mental chatter  
Showin' where your mind is at  
  
While relating to each other  
How strong your love can be  
By resisting all the good times with each groovy chick we see  
  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so  
  
I gotta keep my image  
While I'm standin on the floor  
If I drop upon my knees  
It's just to keep them on my nose  
  
You think that I'm not human  
And my heart is made of stone  
But I never had no problems  
'Cause my body's pretty strong  
I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so  
  
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so  
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so  
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so
