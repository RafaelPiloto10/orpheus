In my eyes, I'm not lazy  
In my face, it's not over  
In your room, I'm not 'll'over  
In your eyes, I'm not worth it  
  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my, gimmie back my  
Gimme back  
  
Heal a million, kill a million  
Peel a million, feel a million  
Heal a million, kill a million  
  
In my eyes, I'm not lazy  
In my face, it's not over  
In your room, I'm not 'll'over  
In your eyes, I'm not worth it  
  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my, gimmie back my  
Gimme back  
  
Heal a million, kill a million  
Peel a million, feel a million  
Heal a million, kill a million  
  
In my eyes, I'm not lazy  
In my face, it's not over  
In your room, I'm not 'll'over  
In your eyes, I'm not worth it  
  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my alcohol, gimmie back my alcohol  
Gimmie back my, gimmie back my  
Gimme back  
  
Heal a million, kill a million  
Peel a million, feel a million  
Heal a million, kill a million
