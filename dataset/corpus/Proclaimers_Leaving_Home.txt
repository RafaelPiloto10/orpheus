East Coast trains run slow  
And Edinburgh seems cold  
For eighteen year old's freedom  
But Leith feels like New York  
All the cars and talk  
Moving down the walk all day  
So I'm lying in this hotel  
Hearing sirens and drunken fights  
But I paid cash to the angels  
Guarding me tonight  
So I'm lying in this hotel  
Hearing sirens and drunken fights  
And I paid cash to the angel  
Guarding me tonight  
Dundee's on my own  
Cry when I come home  
Have to carry on somehow  
Leith could be New York  
All the cars and talk  
Moving down the walk all day
