It is not easy  
It is not easy  
  
Looking from a window  
At the back of a house  
At the edge of a town  
It's gray  
Like the day  
When I lost it  
Clouds overhead  
I talked to a flower  
That was almost dead  
My body a prison  
Why did I do it?  
Someone told me not to  
But still went through it  
  
[Chorus]  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
Needed somewhere to clear  
My head  
Find some strength  
A warmer bed  
Maximum love in a  
Minimal world  
I'd never achieved it  
But then I believed it  
So when I lost it, how?  
I'm not sure now,  
It was a strange feeling  
Like a paw repealing itself  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I can wake up in the morning  
And not believe what I see  
Look in the mirror  
And think if that's really me  
I don't think I suit my face  
It's not a catastrophe  
It's more a philosophy  
Like the Russians  
Wondering why  
We're born under a blue sky  
But die in a dark forest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
This is neither old nor new  
It's always, forever  
Somewhere between sense  
And ambition  
Pleasure and decision  
We have to make a choice  
What do we want?  
Everyone singing  
"War, what is it good for?"  
While planning the next one?  
  
I don't need to win  
You don't have to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
The war within us  
But it gets easier  
The more we learn  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option
