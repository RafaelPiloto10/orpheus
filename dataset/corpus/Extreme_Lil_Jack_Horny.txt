Mother goose  
Never should haver ever let that jack get loose  
But that little boy blue  
Keeps messing all the things he gets his hands into  
  
Now look what you've done  
Stuck in your thumb, pulled out a plum  
  
Mama says, 'boys will be boys'  
That's lil' jack horny  
Mama says 'boys will be boys'  
That's lil' jack horny  
  
Jack and Jill  
Went up and down and up and fooled around the hill  
Now only time will tell  
How late the rabbit will arrive in wonderland  
  
Now look what you've done  
Stuck in your thumb, pulled out a plum  
  
Mama says, 'boys will be boys'  
That's lil' jack horny  
Daddy says 'don't need no birth control'  
That's lil' jack horny
