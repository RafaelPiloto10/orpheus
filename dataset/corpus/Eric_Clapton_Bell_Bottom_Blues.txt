Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.  
I don't want to lose this feeling.  
And if I could choose a place to die  
It would be in your arms.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?  
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?  
I'd gladly do it because  
I don't want to fade away.  
Give me one more day, please.  
I don't want to fade away.  
In your heart I want to stay.  
  
It's all wrong, but it's all right.  
The way that you treat me baby.  
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.  
You won't find a better loser.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye.  
I'm sure we're gonna meet again,  
And if we do, don't you be surprised  
If you find me with another lover.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to fade away.  
Give me one more day please.  
I don't want to fade away.  
In your heart I long to stay.
