Vacate is the word...vengeance has no place so near to her  
Cannot find the comfort in this world  
Artificial tear...vessel stabbed...next up volunteers  
Vulnerable wisdom can't adhere...  
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on...  
But there's a trapdoor in the sun...immortality...  
As privileged as a whore...victims in demand for public show  
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door  
Holier than thou how?  
Surrendered...executed anyhow  
Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor...  
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on, too...  
But saw the trapdoor in the sun...  
Immortality...  
I cannot stop the thought...I'm running in the dark...  
Coming up a which way sign...all good truants must decide...  
Oh, stripped and sold, mom...auctioned forearm...  
And whiskers in the sink...  
Truants move on...cannot stay long  
Some die just to live...  
Ohh...
