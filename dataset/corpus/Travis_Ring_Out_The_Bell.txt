I'm so lonely  
God won't know me  
I can hardly get up  
I sold my halo  
Back in April  
Now I can't hold my head up  
So ring out the bell  
I'll fly where there's someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
Someone see me  
Feel me breathing  
Someone get me closer  
If I see sunrise  
And screw up my eyes  
I don't feel so lonesome  
So ring out the bell  
I'll fly where there's someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
I'm doing fine  
I'm getting by  
Tell me what I should do  
God knows why I'm  
Watching the sky  
It's so blue  
One fine morning  
Without warning  
I'll go through the  
Blue sky  
Until I do I'll  
Wait for you  
So I can get this right  
So ring out the bell  
I'll fly where there's someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
So ring out the bell  
I'll fly where there's someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell
