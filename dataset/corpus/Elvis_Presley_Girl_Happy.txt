[Chorus:]  
Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy  
Girl happy, can't you see  
  
Every girl I see looks good to me  
What crazy way I were to be  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I see a pretty face  
My heart just heads for outer space  
I need a girl to make my life worth of living  
Yes...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy  
Mama keep your daughter out of sight  
I'm in a loving mood tonight  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy  
  
[Chorus] [x 2]
