There are times that I should go away  
To think of you and I  
For it isn't only now, I need your love  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
In the night time when I lie awake  
And think of you in my heart  
For it isn't only now, I need your love  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you  
That I love you, and I do  
Everyone believes me when I tell them  
Why don't you, why don't you  
  
When I think of things that ought to be  
And I feel your hand in mine  
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you  
That I love you, and I do  
Everyone believes me when I tell them  
Why don't you, why don't you  
  
When I think of things that ought to be  
And I feel your hand in mine  
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love  
All of my life, all of my life  
All of my life [Repeat: x3]
