I never felt the way I feel tonight  
Here with you in the pale moonlight  
Tender love songs on the radio  
Sweet, sweet music that lets feelings flow  
  
There's love in our hearts and the stars above us  
All that's left are the final touches  
  
Warm wine chilling in the mountain stream  
Sweet Magnolias drifting on the breeze  
Soft, southern accent on your Ruby red lips  
The promise held in your fingertips  
  
For the searching hand of midnight lovers  
All that's left are the final touches  
  
This perfect picture of you and me  
One more move and it'll be complete  
  
For the searching hand of midnight lovers  
All that's left are the final touches  
  
All that's left are the final touches
