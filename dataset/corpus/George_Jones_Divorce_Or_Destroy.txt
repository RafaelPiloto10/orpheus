We've lived together for a long time  
But now the love is gone we once knew  
We're old enough to know we can't live life this way  
And young enough to start with somebody new.  
  
So it's divorce or destroying each other  
Which one of the two should we chose  
You say in your heart there's no love left for me  
And in my heart there's no love left for you.  
  
We stay together for the children  
Soon the children will be grown and be gone  
Yet we keep on destroying each other  
And to live life this way just must be wrong,  
  
So it's divorce or destroying each other  
Which one of the two should we chose  
You say in your heart there's no love left for me  
And in my heart there's no love left for you.  
  
In my heart, no love left for you
