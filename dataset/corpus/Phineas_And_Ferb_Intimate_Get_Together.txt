Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get together!  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't call it that, it's just a get together!  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't spill your drink  
Don't drop your food  
Don't make the music in the house go boom  
Hey, don't use my mom's good scissors  
And please stay out of my room  
Take your feet off the chair  
No running in the house  
Put a coaster under that drink  
Hey, these tchotchkes aren't for juggling  
And that's a toilet, not a sink!  
  
Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get together  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't call it that, it's just a get together  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
  
Jeremy: Candace party!  
  
Candace: Hey, what's this in this fishbowl?  
I said don't play with the remote!  
Hey close the door, were you born in a barn?  
Which one of you brought this goat?  
  
Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get together  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't call it that, it's just a get together  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: We're talking I to the N to the T-I-M-A-T-E get together  
Everyone: Whaaaat?  
Candace: I to the N to the T-I-M-A-T-E get together  
Everyone: That's right.
