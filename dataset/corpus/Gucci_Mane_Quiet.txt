Do anybody know somebody who know somebody?  
Who know somebody who know somebody who got the mollys  
Karate Kid but I don't even know karate  
Kush got my eyes low like Mr. Miyagi  
East Atlanta Santa, yeah my stomach fat and jolly  
Fucked up 50 grand in Vegas with my nigga (?)  
Got the battle of the bands going in my Robin's  
And if you think of robbin Gucci, you gon have some problems  
Servin' pizza pies, all my pies got extra toppings  
And I be shittin' on all these niggas just like pigeon droppings  
Thirity grand in all hundreds, I don't do the wallet  
And I'm about to fly to New York cause I'm going shoppin'  
  
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce  
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse  
Way I'm beating that white girl, that's domestic violence  
And my money talk for me cause I be being quiet  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Quiet, quiet, cause I be being quiet  
I let my money talk for me because I'm being quiet  
  
Break a 4-way off a brick and then I'm bout to fry it  
My money gettin' obese, your shit is on a diet  
I sip lean all day every day until the kid is tired  
I make em search for that ? cause this pussy's wired  
If you think you can defeat me, fuck it nigga, try it  
I got squares all in my trunk I think he wanna buy it  
Got a G-4 but I do not have no one to fly it  
I'm so fly that I might stop rappin' and be a pilot  
Gucci Mane the shit and you can't deny it  
I got the game in a knot and you can't untie it  
I let my money do the talking, I be being quiet..  
And I get money out the streets but keep my business private!  
  
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce  
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse  
Way I'm beating that white girl, that's domestic violence  
And my money talk for me cause I be being quiet  
  
[Chorus x2]
