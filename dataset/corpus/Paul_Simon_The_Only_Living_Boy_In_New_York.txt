Tom, get your plane right on time.  
I know your part'll go fine.  
Fly down to Mexico.  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am,  
The only living boy in New York.  
I get the news I need on the weather report.  
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report.  
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile.  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da here I am  
The only living boy in New York  
  
Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where,  
And we don't know here.  
  
Tom, get your plane right on time.  
I know you've been eager to fly now.  
Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da  
Like it shines on me  
The only living boy in New York,  
The only living boy in New York.
