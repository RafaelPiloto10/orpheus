She's a dancing girl who brings up the heat  
Hits on all the men  
She knows how to move and make you feel  
Like you want to get into sin  
A chocolate bar was going really far  
Really made me catch my breath  
So she had an unordinary glance  
I got down tools in the chest  
Down and dirty  
You're down and dirty, alright  
She's down and dirty  
You're down and dirty  
She twisted her ass around drinks  
While the dirty works the girl's booty  
Whispered in my ear what I want to hear  
Says, "Come with me baby, let's play." (Okay!)  
She went to the back to get her traps  
My sixth sense was bothering me  
She came to work and something I heard  
Makes me want to get comfy  
Down and dirty  
She's down and dirty, alright  
Get down and dirty  
Get down (Listen)  
Down and dirty  
Woo!  
Alright  
Ooh yeah  
Well there's something going on  
Something I've never known before  
Leather and lace is all that I can see  
I lost my power of will  
You know she should be still  
Never thought I'd get hit by some teen, no  
I start to bleed, have mercy on me  
I'm feelin' a bit distressed  
What you're doing to me is so obscene  
Got myself into a mess  
She started to dance, I grabbed my pants  
Found my way to the door  
Hot on my trail, a thousand females  
Saying, "Baby, more more more!"  
Down and dirty  
(Hurt me)  
Down and dirty  
(Well, well, well)  
Down and dirty  
(Oh yeah)  
Get down and dirty  
(She is)  
Get down (Down)  
Get dirty (Dirty)  
Take me down (Alright)  
One more  
Get down (Oh yeah)  
Get dirty (Turn around)  
Get down (Come over here)  
Down and dirty  
Come back for more, ya hear? Hah!
