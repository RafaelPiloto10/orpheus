When a days work is done  
And you're down on the ground  
You come home just to find  
That she's not around.  
You see red, you see red,  
When she takes you for a fool.  
You see red, you see red  
Read the writing on the wall.  
What you give is what you get  
When it comes to loving.  
If you lie, make her cry,  
She will leave you alone.  
You see red, you see red,  
When she takes you for a fool.  
You see red, you see red  
Read the writing on the wall.  
So you drink your gin,  
And drown your sorrows,  
Don't expect a tomorrow.  
Wasting away ain't now way to say  
That you're sorry, for what you have done.  
When a days work is done  
And you're down on the ground  
You come home just to find  
That she's not around.  
You see red, you see red,  
When she takes you for a fool.  
You see red, you see red  
Read the writing on the wall.
