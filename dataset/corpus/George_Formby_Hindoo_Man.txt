Over there in India a Hindoo resides smoking his hoakam all day  
Opium and bits of rope and fag ends besides, a wise man from the East
Whitechapel way.  
He's got a lovely palace on the beach  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
He's got twelve bedrooms with eight wives in each,  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He's got one wife who wears a veil, it covers half her face,  
From her nose right to her toes you'll see nothing else but space.  
She'll dance and waggle her "San Fairy Ann"  
For the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He practices his magic in the Eastern bazaar  
Slave girls come under his spell  
When he puts on the fluence,  
They don't know where they are  
He does Indian tricks and dirty tricks as well.  
Now what he fancies always does him good  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He lives on rice, roast beef and Yorkshire pud  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
He wears a dishcloth round his waist,  
His favourite wife called Nellie  
Said, "You'd look well if the darned thing fell  
You'd have nowt to cover your...  
He said "Who cares, I could always wear a fan  
I'm a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He looks just like a Nabob of renown  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man  
A Nabob, two bob, three bob, half a crown.  
He's a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
A Princess brought him jewels and said  
"For all your love I yearn"  
But jewels could not compare with what  
He went and gave her in return.  
He's ninety nine, but he does all he can.  
For a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo Man.
