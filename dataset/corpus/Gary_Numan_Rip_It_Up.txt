The new law is moving in  
Now you see them now you don't  
Like a Shadow in my diguise  
Like a soft machine on ice  
Who are you?  
'I'm the man  
I am the cure and disease'  
Who am I?  
I'm the need  
I am the weakness that feeds  
I've got to rip it up  
I've got to tear it down  
I've got to break the word  
I've got to fight for you  
Who am I to criticise  
I'm unsafe at any speed  
'We can change the world' she said  
Never changed it never tried  
I'm cold and hard  
But I don't mind  
I've been everything I can be  
I've been sick  
And I've got he screams  
These boys don't know when to push  
Did you know that I don't run  
Did you know that I don't hide  
Did you know that I don't sleep  
Did you know that I don't care  
I am the soft machine  
I am the word and the law  
I am the new machine  
I am your feelings and more  
Come inside and Play with me  
I'll show you things to forget  
No-one talks  
And no-one leaves  
No-one remembers the way  
I've got to fight the man  
I've got to fight the need  
I've got to fight the law  
I've got to fight the word
