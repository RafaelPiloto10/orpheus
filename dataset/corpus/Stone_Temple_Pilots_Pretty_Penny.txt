Have you seen your mother girl? Has she gone away?  
Gone away and found the pearl  
But the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
How far will you go I say, just to bait a mouse?  
Shorter lived and longer gone  
Can you figure out?  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
Have you lost your sister girl? She's all but blown away  
Blown away and lost the pearl  
And the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her
