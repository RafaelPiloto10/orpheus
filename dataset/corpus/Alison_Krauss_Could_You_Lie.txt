Go on and lie I've heard it all before  
You had no shame  
This pain I feel you've never known  
The rain outside is shifting in the wind  
The road is looking lonelier  
Alone again  
  
Love is real  
Then love goes on and on  
The words you say condemn you  
As the guilty one  
I guess you're not the kind you claim to be  
Always looking out to get your love for free  
  
Could you lie and say you love me just a little  
One more wrong will keep us one more night  
When quiet fades at the light of day  
I see the truth  
It's on your face again  
  
When morning breaks my heart won't understand  
Spend a lifetime raising houses on the sand  
The rain outside is shifting in the wind  
The road is looking lonelier  
Alone again  
  
Could you lie and say you love me just a little  
One more wrong will keep us one more night  
When quiet fades at the light of day  
I see the truth  
It's on your face again
