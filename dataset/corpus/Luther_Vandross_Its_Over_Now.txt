Something's goin' on, it's the middle of the night  
And my "esp" woke me up  
  
I know what's going on girl, you ain't been treating me right  
And your sweet talking ain't enough  
I know you're messing with at least two other guys  
You fooled me a long time but the kid is gettin' wise  
  
Don't hug me, don't kiss me, don't "love me down"  
Excuse me, but you see this love affair is?  
  
Over now  
(You did me bad)  
Over now  
It's over now  
(You treated me so bad)  
Over now  
(It's all over baby)  
  
I didn't know it when I walked into the house  
But you were on the telephone  
That's when I heard you tell him to come over tonight  
Said you were gonna be alone  
  
I heard you mention that I had some place to go  
You helped me pack my things, but it's you whose got to go  
  
You're busted! You must have fooled me for a while  
But honey, as they say "Hit the road!" It's all?  
  
You can go now, keep your voice down  
There's no need to fuss and shout  
Use the back door, I don't want no  
Nosy neighbors to see you checkin' out  
  
"Get out!"  
  
Bye baby, so long, it's been "Oh wow!"  
If you really loved me I wouldn't say it's?
