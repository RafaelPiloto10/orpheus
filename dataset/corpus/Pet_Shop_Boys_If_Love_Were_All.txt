I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
  
Hey ho if love were all  
I should be lonely  
  
I believe the more you love a man  
The more you give your trust  
The more you're bound to lose  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
Chaos would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse  
Hey ho if love were all  
Hey ho if love were all
