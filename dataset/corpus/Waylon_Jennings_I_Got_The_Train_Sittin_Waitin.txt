I took my woman down to the local depot  
From there to anywhere if you want to you can go  
I said now pretty momma I've had myself enough  
Of your fussing and your fighting and it's sure gonna get rough  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the train sittin' waitin'  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to go,better get aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
I've tried to love you woman every way I know how  
But you keep on a naggin' and I've had it starting now  
If you don't like the way you're living you know what you can do  
Said the trains sitting there it's a big black choo-choo  
  
I got the train sittin' waitin'  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to go,get yourself aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
Well, I looked up at the schedule and it said nine thirteen  
The central is a leaving all the lights are turning green  
The whistle is a blowin' here's your ticket and your pass  
The door is open wide so don't let your coat tail drag  
  
[Chorus]
