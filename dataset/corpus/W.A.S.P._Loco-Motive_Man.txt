I write to claim a lost identity of me  
And I leave a message for you all  
Written here the fear that are my destiny you see  
Come behold madness you never saw  
No love for killer babies  
My blood is written on your walls  
Oh, it's time I leave you now  
Mama look what you made me  
Oh no, you never heard me call  
Oh, I know you'll hear me now, now  
'Cause I'm gone to meet my maker  
'Cause I'm locomotive man  
One killer baby's come to call  
'Cause I'm gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
I'm coming down to take you all  
I feel the rage that brings  
The fame of that I need  
I've now a face forever more  
Living with the fears  
That hear those fantasies in me  
Come an see sadness you never saw  
No love for killer babies  
My pain is written on your walls  
Oh, it's time I leave you now  
Mama look what you made me  
Your locomotive killer calls  
Oh, I know you hear me now  
'Cause I'm gone to meet my maker  
'Cause I'm locomotive man  
One killer baby's come to call  
'Cause I'm gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
I'm coming down to take you all  
Don't wait for me  
Don't hate for me  
Don't ask of what went wrong  
Don't pray for me or wonder why  
You've known this all along  
I've sinned for you  
I envy you  
Your pain I'll never know  
I wanted love, you gave me none  
I've come to take you home  
'Cause I'm gone to meet my maker  
'Cause I'm locomotive man  
One killer baby's come to call  
'Cause I'm gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
I'm coming down to take you all  
'Cause I'm gone to meet my maker  
'Cause I'm locomotive man  
One killer baby's come to call  
'Cause I'm gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
I'm coming down to take you all  
Oh god I'm coming  
Read my words I'm coming  
I got a gun I'm coming  
You won't hear me coming
