Well, I was driving around tryin to find a place to get a beer and some
cigarettes.  
Pullin up behind me, not afraid to flirt, there's a girl in a red corvette.  
I saw in her face that she wanted to race, so I let my car outta jail.  
Man I blew it, before I knew it, the feds were on my tail.  
I knew it was trouble, didn't wanna stop, I couldn't forget that girl.  
My dashboard's slick from alcohol, and my head's still in a whirl.  
Just a country boy in the city lights, tryin to have some fun  
But the man behind me didn't wanna play, he pulled out a gun.  
Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man  
I'm just a poor boy doin the best that I can  
I've been stepped upon and pushed around  
You can tie me up but never tie me down  
Well I had it comin, I hit the wall and my car went up in flames.  
My head got hammered, thrown in the slammer, no one but me to blame.  
That's my story, ain't much for it, but I know I've paid my dues.  
One thing I know, in my heart and soul, I ain't never gonna lose.  
They say I might be goin crazy, hey what else can I do, I have my mind  
Don't ya push me around no more...
