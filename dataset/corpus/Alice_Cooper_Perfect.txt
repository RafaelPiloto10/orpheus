She's an overnight sensation  
In the mirror on her wall  
She gets a standing ovation  
At every shower curtain call  
  
And she becomes a pop star  
In the safety of her car  
And then she falls to pieces  
At the karaoke bar  
  
And she's perfect  
Until the lights go on  
And then it all goes wrong  
Cause now she's not so perfect  
  
She can shake it just like J-Lo  
When the bedroom lights go down  
But when she hits the dance floor  
She's a hip-hop hippo clown  
  
She's perfect  
Until the lights go on  
And then it all goes wrong  
Cause now she's not so perfect  
  
She's perfect  
She's so fine  
She's so wonderful  
In the arena of her mind  
  
She's not perfect  
She's all mine  
She can't sing or dance  
She ain't got a chance  
But baby, I don't mind  
  
She's perfect  
Oh, she's perfect  
Ah, she's so perfect  
You know, she's so perfect  
Ah, ah, ah  
  
Sing baby  
Dance, dance, dance  
You got it  
Shake it down  
Oh, that's bad  
That's bad  
I love you baby  
That's just awful  
You got it  
You got it
