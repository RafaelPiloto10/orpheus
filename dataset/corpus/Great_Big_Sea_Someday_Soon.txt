They keep talking of the things they'd do if we'd only vote them in  
One more dollar and all the bickering and suffering would end.  
If you'd sign your 'X' in favour it's three jobs for every man  
You can burn your boats, that's what they said,  
It seemed they had it planned.  
And I hope they haven't forgotten, the promises they made  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause they said they'd stop the fighting  
And they said they would bring peace  
And they said they'd find a serum that can cure all our disease.  
And they said they'd house the homeless  
And put black and white in tune  
And they said they'd feed a hungry child  
And I hope it's someday soon  
  
Saw a man sleep in an alley lane with a paper for a bed  
And the headline shown beneath the man and this is what they read,  
"If elected there would be no persons living in the street"  
But the paper couldn't even provide shelter for his freezing feet.  
And I hope they haven't forgotten, The promises they made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well they said it would be so different, if we'd would only play their games  
And I've been playing for so long and I swear its still the same!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
