My true love is sitting on a pile of stones  
And he's wondering to himself  
Oh, where did I go wrong?  
My true love has found himself alone  
And he's sorry for it all  
And for the hurt, we've done  
And I've given more than I can take  
Fallen for the same mistake  
Promises were made to break  
What will save us now?  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember  
My true love is a saccharine kind of pill  
That tastes too sweet for words  
And cannot be fulfilled  
My true love is a dangerous China cup  
With all the broken pieces  
That cannot be picked up  
Now all the colors left to run  
All the dreams have been undone  
Love has left me standing here  
Raging at the sun  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember
