I know I could use a rest

it never dawned on me, no...  
  
Benjamin, no, oh...  
  
Benjamin, no, oh...  
  
Benjamin, no...  
  
where did you go?  
  
no, no, no...  
  
Benjamin, no, oh...  
  
Benjamin, no, oh...  
  
Benjamin, no...  
  
where did you go?

you said that I could tie you down, no...  
  
you said that I could tie you down, no...

I know I could use the rest
