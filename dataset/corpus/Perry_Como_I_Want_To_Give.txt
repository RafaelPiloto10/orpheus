I wanna give  
I wanna give my love to you completely  
I beg of you  
I beg of you to listen to my heart  
I've never prayed like this before  
And I'm askin' you not to close the door  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
I've never prayed like this before  
And I'm askin' you not to close the door  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
I wanna give  
I wanna give you all the strength within me  
To make a world  
To make a world that cannot fall apart  
And you can sit upon a throne  
Oh, I'll give it all just for you alone  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
And you can sit upon a throne  
Oh, I'll give it all just for you alone  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me
