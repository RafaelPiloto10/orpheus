I'm living in this line  
I know my place, could think of no way  
Of edging along in a loser's race  
The line was moving slowly  
Day by night  
Everybody's shuffling on to keep a place in the line  
  
Nine long years I've been in line  
Getting nowhere there is no reason  
For this line I don't care.  
Everybody's standing in the burning sun  
Everybody's shuffling on keeping a place in the line  
  
Don't you think we're gonna make it  
We've got a place in line  
We're gonna make it some time  
Somehow
