To all that are receiving this broadcast we are now entering our  
Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage. This ongoing event has been  
Upgraded to a national emergency. It has been a sleepless night here in Metro  
Detroit as panic and terror has swept the streets. It seems much of Detroit  
As well as the rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable  
Cloud that still clutches the sky. From New York to Honolulu, Miami to  
Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided but a wall of darkness and  
Artificial night still grips the land. Witnesses now tell us that thousands  
Upon thousands of people are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are  
Painted and they look like CLOWNS!!! The people are running and screaming but  
Eye witnesses say they're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy  
Has overtaken them. At this time we do not know where or why the people are  
Running but there seems to be an organized plan directing there action. Its  
Like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina. The immense crowd  
Of clowns are now on the move all in unison moving in one direction towards  
An unknown destination. Its almost as if they see what others cannot heeding  
An inaudible call that silently pierces this calm before the storm.
