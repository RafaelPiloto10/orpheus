By David Allan Coe  
  
Would you lay with me in A field of stone  
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me  
  
Should my lips grow dry,  
Would you wet them, dear  
In the midnight hour,  
If my lips were dry  
  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk A thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Would you lay with me  
In the stream of life  
When the moon is full,  
Would you bathe with me  
  
Will you still love me,  
When I'm down and out  
In my time of trial,  
Would you stand by me  
  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk A thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Would you lay with me  
In A field of stone  
If my needs were strong,  
Would you lay with me
