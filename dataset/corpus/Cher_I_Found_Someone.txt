Don't you know, so many things they come and go  
Like your words that once rang true  
Just like the love I thought I found in you  
And I remember the thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes  
But you walked away when I needed you most  
  
Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone  
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness  
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone  
  
Dry your eyes. I never could bear to see you cry  
Someday your love will shine through  
And show you the feelings you never really knew  
But, baby, don't ya lose that thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes  
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe  
  
That maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone  
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness  
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone  
  
Too long on the border line, wonderin' if your love was really mine  
But you left me with open eyes, and when I realized, baby  
I found someone to take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone  
Baby I found someone to take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone
