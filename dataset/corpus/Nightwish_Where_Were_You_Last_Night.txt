Still  
Spinning 'round in my head  
How I regret everything that I said  
Why did I tell you to go?  
Saving my pride but losing my soul  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
Lost  
In the dark and my fears  
If only you saw the tracks of my tears  
I think I'm losing my mind  
Where did you go, and what did you find?  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?
