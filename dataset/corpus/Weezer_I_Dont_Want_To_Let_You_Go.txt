All the times you came to me and told me that you cared  
I was dreaming of happy days that we both could share  
Maybe I got too excited, and maybe you freaked out  
Maybe I just have to call you up and scream and shout  
  
All of my friends tell me that I ought to play it cool  
No one likes too much attention from a desperate fool  
Still I don't believe that I can keep it all inside  
When I see your pretty face, I almost want to cry  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I remember the days when I was stronger than a wall  
Try as anybody might, they couldn't move me at all  
Now I fall to pieces when you softly call my name  
Going up in smoke rings like a moth within your flame  
  
I have lost all hope of being normal once again  
I will be a slave to you until the bitter end  
Even if it's a hundred years before you change your mind  
I will be here waiting girl until the end of time  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
Oh, oh
