Tonight I'll be sleeping on the mountain top  
I got a billion stars for my witness  
In the morning I'll go down and the sun comes up  
And I'll take a drink from the bitter root river  
  
Have you been lonely  
(yes I've been lonely)  
I've been lonely too  
  
Have you been lonely  
(yes I've been lonely)  
I've been lonely too  
  
Tonight I'll be sleeping on the mountain top

Have you been traveling  
(yes I've been traveling)  
I've been traveling too  
  
(that girl can play)  
  
Have you been traveling  
(yes I've been traveling)  
I've been traveling too  
  
(lordy help me to play)
