When I was just a little child (little child)  
Happiness was there awhile (there awhile)  
And from me it... It slipped one day  
Happiness come back I say  
  
Cause if you don't come  
I've got to go looking  
For happiness  
  
Well if you don't come  
I've got to go looking  
God, for happiness, happiness  
  
Say that  
Say I'm hurting  
And it's no sense  
I'm hurting, I'm hurting  
Deep inside  
Oh good god now  
  
Oh hear my cry, hear my cry  
Yeah my my my my my my my cry  
  
Been together like school children (school children)  
Then you hurt me just in vain (just in vain)  
Oh, Lord, I'm your weary child  
Oh, happiness come back awhile  
  
Cause if you don't come  
I'm gonna go looking  
For happiness (the road is dangerous)  
I've got to go looking  
For happiness, happiness  
  
Said I'm  
Don't you know I'm  
I'm hurting, hurting inside  
Oh I'm hurting  
Who cares  
Who cares  
  
Does the one who love, oh  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
  
Does the one who love  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
  
(Been together like school children)
