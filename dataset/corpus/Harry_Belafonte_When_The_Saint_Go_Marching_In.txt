Oh, when the saints, go marching in,  
Yes when the saints go marching in.  
Oh Lord I want to be in that ever lovin' number  
When the saints go marching in.  
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,  
Yes when the saints go marching in.  
Oh Lord I want to be in that number  
When the saints go marching in.  
Oh yes, I had a dear old mother,  
And if you should see her before I do,  
Won't you tell her that you saw me coming,  
I was struttin' straight on through  
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,  
Yes when the saints go marching in.  
Oh Lord I want to be in that number  
When the saints go marching in.
