In the morning I raise my head  
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by  
And the thing I want out of life is  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
  
You can run, you can hide  
But you never get away  
You can lie and deny  
But you know you're gonna pay  
Never loved, never thought you could  
Treat you right, girl, you know I would  
You can fight but tonight  
There's nothin' you can do  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)  
  
You can walk in a haze  
You can travel till you die  
You can live in a dream  
And your life will pass you by  
Every day that you hesitate  
You're never changin' the hands of fate  
You can fight but tonight  
There's nothing you can do  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
  
In the morning I raise my head  
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by  
And the thing I want out of life is  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
Ah (I want you) (I want you)
