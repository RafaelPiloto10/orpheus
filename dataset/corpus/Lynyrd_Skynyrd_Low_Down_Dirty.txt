It said 3:30 on my watch  
Big show don't start 'till 9:00  
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot  
She started pouring shots  
It was only me and her in there  
"Let's get outta here"  
Might lose my job but I don't care  
Come along if you dare  
Lay down my tailgate  
Hey boy what'chu say?!  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!  
Low down and dirty  
I turned up her radio  
She started dancin' real slow  
Like she was puttin' on a show  
Three hours left to rock and roll  
Wet sweat was pourin' off her skin  
Her body made me wanna sin  
Right then my buzz was kickin' in  
She had a devil's grin  
And then her boss drove by  
She flipped them the bird  
She looked me in the eye and said  
You give me the urge!  
To do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!  
Low down and dirty!  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!
