High and dry in the long hot day  
Lost and lonely in every way  
Got the flats all around me, sky up above  
Yes, I need a little water of love  
I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain  
Cryin' out for some soothing rain  
I believe I've taken enough  
Yes, I need a little water of love  
  
[Chorus]  
Water of love, deep in the ground  
But there ain't no water here to be found  
Someday, baby, when the river runs free  
It'll carry that water of love to me  
  
Once I had a man I could call my own  
Once I had a man, now my man is gone  
Once there was a river, now there's a stone  
You know it's evil when you're living alone  
  
[Chorus]
