Seems the time is near for finding a place outside  
Seems the time is here for holding the window wide  
So I'm going to try  
To open up one eye  
But if the world is too wide  
I'll be home to hide  
Keep it warm inside, if it's strange, outside.  
  
Seems the time has flown, when we lived inside a cloud  
Seems the time has gone, when nothing we said was out loud  
Going to find a word  
Make myself be heard  
But if the world is too loud  
I'll be home from the crowd  
Keep it soft inside, if it's strange, outside.  
  
Seems the time has come for banging our feet to the ground  
Seems the time has come to see if the world is round  
Sweep the smoke away  
Reach the earth today  
But if the world is all wrong  
I won't be staying long  
Keep it cool inside, if it's strange, outside.
