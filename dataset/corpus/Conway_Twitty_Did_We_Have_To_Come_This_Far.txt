When you were only friendly on my mind  
Before your love became my way of life  
You knew that it would rain on down the line  
Did we have to come this far to say goodbye  
  
Why did you keep puttin' off your leaving  
When staying was the last thing on your mind  
You could have turned around and spared my feelings  
Did we have to come this far to say goodbye  
  
What made you give my love a chance to live  
Just long enough to be afraid to die  
You knew I wanted more than you would give  
Did we have to come this far to say goodbye  
Why did you keep puttin'
