I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't want to go there anymore and I  
Know all the steps up to your door  
But I don't want to go there anymore  
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky  
Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up and sing you a song  
But I don't want to have to go that far and I  
I've got you down, I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start  
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
Don't wait for the sky to clear  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I've watched you so long  
Screamed your name  
I don't know what else  
I can say  
  
But I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
For all these games  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't want to go there  
Anymore...
