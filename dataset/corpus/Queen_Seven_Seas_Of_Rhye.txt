Fear me you lord and lady preachers  
I descend upon your earth from the skies  
I command your very souls you unbelievers  
Bring before me what is mine  
The seven seas of Rhye  
  
Can you hear me you peers and privy councilors  
I stand before you naked to the eyes  
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust  
I swear that you'll be mine  
At the seven seas of Rhye  
  
Sister I live and lie for you  
Mister do and I'll die  
You are mine I possess you  
Belong to you forever  
  
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through  
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive  
I'll survive I'll survive  
Then I'll defy the laws of nature  
And come out alive  
  
Begone with you you shod and shady senators  
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries  
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours  
And with a smile  
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
