Eternally  
This field remains  
Stanlow  
No heart or head or mind  
No season could erase  
We set you down  
To care for us  
Stanlow  
A vision fading fast  
A million hearts to one  
But so restrained  
She turns away  
Stanlow  
  
I've seen her face in every day  
The same routine along the way  
Tonight in the rain  
Alone  
  
And then again it been so long  
Since one single promise kept  
All to say to  
Reason  
We wanted a heart  
To say what we want to  
  
A morning comes just as it left  
A warmer feeling seldom owned  
And tonight  
All I see  
Alone  
And as she turned we always knew  
That her heart was never there
