Dead leaves and the dirty ground  
When I know you're not around  
Shiny tops and soda pops  
When I hear your lips make a sound  
When I hear your lips make a sound  
  
Thirty notes in the mailbox  
Will tell that I'm coming home  
And I think I'm gonna stick around  
For a while so you're not alone  
For a while so you're not alone  
  
If you can hear a piano fall  
You can hear me coming down the hall  
If I could just hear your pretty voice  
I don't think I need to see ya at all  
I don't think I need to see ya at all  
  
Soft hair and a velvet tongue  
I want to give you what you give to me  
And every breath that is in your lungs  
Is a tiny little gift to me  
Is a tiny little gift to me  
  
I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down  
Then I come home  
No one to wrap my arms around  
Wrap my arms around  
  
Well any man with a microphone  
Can tell you what he loves the most  
And you know why you love at all  
If you're thinking of the holy ghost  
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
