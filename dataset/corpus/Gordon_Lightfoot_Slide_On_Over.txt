Momma's got her long dress on  
See how that little girl walks  
Now we got it rollin'  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Momma's got something  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Momma put your long dress on  
I'd like to take that little girl to town  
Now that we have rolled it,  
How're we gonna hold it down  
Gonna slide on over to that pretty little love that I've found  
Now we've got it rolling,  
How're we gonna hold it down  
  
Now momma's got her long dress on  
Listen to that little girl talk  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Gonna slide on over to  
That funny little love that I've got  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Cause my momma's got something,  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling,  
How we gonna get it stopped
