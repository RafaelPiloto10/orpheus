I see lovers passing by  
But no matter how I try  
I can't greet them with a grin  
'Cause I'm standing  
On the outside lookin' in  
  
Friends have told me all along  
I've been playing my cards all wrong  
But I just can't seem to win  
And I'm always  
On the outside lookin' in  
  
Oh, how it hurts  
To see others enjoy love  
I've never known  
And I'm afraid  
That I'll spend all my night  
In my room all alone  
  
Maybe someday I will find someone  
That I can call mine  
On that day my life'll begin  
And I won't be  
On the outside lookin' in
