[Cows mooing and carnival music plays in the background]  
  
Here we are. This is the calm before the storm. We off the track now. That
means we're heading into  
Brand new unknown territorys y'all. We into the crop circles, It says time
waits for no mutahfuckin'  
Body. After this short calm, a vicious storm will arrive. A horendously wicked
storm. Lighting bolts  
So powerful they set fire to water. Thunder loud enogh to shatter brick walls.
And it's headin' right  
Towards us all. We call this storm The Tempest. Tornados of fire, being chased
by enormus tidal waves.  
The tempest. Tearing down forests into feilds reveiling crop circles. The
Tempest. Who will be left,  
Who will still be around in the end. The Tempest. Who will survive long enough
to join us for the new  
Dawn. Icp is rollin' over.
