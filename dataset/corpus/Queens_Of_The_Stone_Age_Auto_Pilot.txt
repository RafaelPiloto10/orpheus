Silent hell on the marble slab  
The best trip that I've ever had  
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around  
My drinks on empty, need another round  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to fly, want to ride with you  
Is this the best that you can do?  
I want to fly, want to ride with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere  
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times  
I never seen you before  
But now that I have, I don't want to see you no more  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control  
Ah-ah, ah  
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control  
Ah-ah, ah  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
[Chorus]
