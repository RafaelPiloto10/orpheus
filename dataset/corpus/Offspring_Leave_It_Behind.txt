Rage burns can't push it aside now  
Can't forgive this grudge is alive now  
All the rage eats you up inside  
Can you leave it behind  
  
What a surprise --  
You're fucked with again Yeah  
It's a way of life you need to get over  
All the rage just eats you alive  
  
Can you leave it behind  
I don't know where it'll end  
The sun has set  
And I can't be friends  
  
I don't know if I can forgive  
The day is long  
But you were so dead wrong
