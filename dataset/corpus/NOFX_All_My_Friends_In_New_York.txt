Staying home is not rally an option  
For alcoholics living in Manhattan  
Have you seen the size of John Bush's apartment?  
It's a bit smaller than a glove compartment  
For all my friends in New York, the next 10 rounds are on me  
New Yorkers have the most familiar faces  
And they do their drugs in the most public places  
Every week an old friend shows up, surprise  
And wants my friends to stay up for the sunrise  
Hello Max, Johnny, John, Omar  
Hello sun, goodbye Niagara Bar  
How many times can you listen to Blondie,  
The Clash, The Ramones, and that Strokes song?  
How many people can we fit in a bathroom?  
That Ryan Adams guy is fucking crazy  
To Pete, Brian, and Jimmy G, the next ten lines are on me
