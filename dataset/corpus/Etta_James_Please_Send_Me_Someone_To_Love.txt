Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace of mind.  
But, if it's not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
Show all the world how to get along,  
Peace will enter when hate is gone.  
But, if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.  
My answer is always the same.  
That unless men put an end to all of this,  
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.  
Just because I'm in misery.  
I'm not begging for no sympathy.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Just send me someone to love.  
  
Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace of mind.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do  
Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do  
Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might happen to you  
  
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?  
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?  
Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery  
  
Hey!  
  
Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too  
Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too  
You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to you
