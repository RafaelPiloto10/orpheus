Every time I run away from you  
You searched me out and found me  
I build a wall, surround myself  
But you've found a way around it  
Everywhere I go in this big old world  
You're just one step behind me  
I turn around and there you are  
Ready to remind me  
Woah, baby, let me, let me go  
Honey, don't you know?  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
I walked the streets the whole night long  
Tryin' to forget you  
I rode the subway end to end  
I wish I'd never met you  
'Coz you got some kinda hold on me  
It's so hard to fight it  
I can't get away from you  
No matter how I try  
Whoa, say you'll let me, let me go  
You've got to let me go  
'Coz there is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I said, whoa, never let me, let me go  
'Coz baby, no, no  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, ohh  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
No hiding place, alright  
No hiding place  
There is nowhere safe, gotta disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
Hiding place, baby, don't you know?  
You gotta let this [Incomprehensible]
