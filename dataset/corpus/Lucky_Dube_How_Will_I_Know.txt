There's lady that I love so much  
She's always on my mind, night and day  
But people told me she's in love  
With another guy in town  
This news makes me so sad  
I'm confused, I don't know what to do about it  
How will I know if she loves me  
I'm confused  
How will I know if she loves me  
Does she really care for me  
How will I know if she loves me  
I'm confused  
I've tried to get her off my mind  
But the love she gives to me, draws me every time  
I've tried to get her off my mind  
But the love she gives to me is so strong  
Each time when we were together  
She use to tell me that I'm the only guy  
[I felt this myself to this woman]?  
Now I'm so confused  
People told me she's in love  
With another guy in town  
This really makes me so sad  
I'm confused  
What am I going to do about it?  
Oh God  
Does she really care for me  
How will I know if she loves me  
How will I know if she loves me  
I wanna know oh baby yeah  
How will I know if she loves me  
You know she's the only one for me  
How will I know if she loves me  
Does she really care for me  
I need her by my side  
How will I know if she loves me  
I wanna know oh baby yea  
How will I know if she loves me [till fade]
