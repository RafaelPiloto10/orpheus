When you're feeling low  
Hypodermic's where you go  
When you're with yourself  
You wish you could be someone else  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't you see like you saw anymore  
Can't you feel like you felt before  
Can't you face anything anymore  
When life's a waste  
Run away  
Your life's a waste  
Run away  
  
Once you get a ride  
Doesn't matter where you lied  
Once you shoot it in  
Doesn't matter who you've been  
You're reaching in but you don't know where to begin  
All your dance and song won't matter when you're gone
