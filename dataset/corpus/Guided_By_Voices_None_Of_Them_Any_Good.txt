(cough cough)  
The para-coats are coming  
When we open fire from the fear  
We realize we're never really here  
  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
Re-crystalizing mansions were visual and real  
But when they moved in for the pillage  
There was no crystal village  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
Waits for a line  
It was quite groovy  
A miscue in the greatest movie  
Doing my scenes  
Of course you should  
Not one of them was any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good
