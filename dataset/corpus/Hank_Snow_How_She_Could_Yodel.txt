Come listen to my tale 'bout a pretty little girl  
That I chanced to meet on the prairie  
T'was a night in June by the western moon  
That I met my charming Mary  
Her eyes were as bright as the stars that night  
When she smiled my heart did bubble  
She couldn't make love or turtle dove  
But, oh boy, She could yodel  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Well, I said to myself, you silly little elf  
I'll win her heart, that's settled  
I tried to hiss that pretty little miss  
But, oh my, how she battled  
She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down, didn't want me around  
But, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Next night on thr trail I heard a big wail  
She changed her mind, felt sorry  
Her yodel, you see, was meant for me  
And she said, you had me worried  
I've rode out tonight to make things right  
And I hope you will forgive me  
When I said, why yes, she took a deep breath  
And, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
And it turned to warm from icy cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she did yodel  
  
Well, then we got married and what do you think  
We're as happy as the birds in the treeses  
Her love is so true and I'm tellin' you  
Her heart no more it freezes  
In a cradle of pine there's a baby devine  
And he never, never grumbles  
He's our own little pet and we can't talk yet  
But I wish you could hear him yodel  
  
He yodels a yodel as sweet as it could be  
He's our own little pet and we love him, you bet  
It don't mean a thing that he can't talk yet  
But he's spendin' his time just learning the way to yodel
