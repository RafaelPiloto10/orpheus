These are the given lyrics for this song, but to my ears,  
Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German.  
This is the story of a lonely man  
Who's seen the world  
From japan to Afghanistan  
Hey! ho!  
  
Everybody thought that I was gone for good  
But I'm back, understood  
Hey! ho!  
  
I've been through the snow and the storm  
Felt the cold  
No one to keep me warm  
Agony and pain  
  
Falco rides again, bang bang  
I won't break  
I won't bend  
Falco rides again  
It's me and my gang  
I came back just like a boomerang  
I'll fight 'till the end  
Falco rides again  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been pushed around  
Beated, mistreated,  
Gagged and bound  
Hey! ho!  
  
Not a soul in the world thought I would survive  
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive  
Hey! ho!  
I'll break down the walls  
No more defeat  
I want the taste of victory  
Revenge is sweet  
  
Rides again!
