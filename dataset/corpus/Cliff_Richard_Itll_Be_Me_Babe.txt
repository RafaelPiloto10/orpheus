If you hear somebody knockin' on your door  
If you see somebody crawlin' across the floor  
Baby it'll be me, I'll be lookin' for you  
And if you see somebody climbin' up a telegraph pole  
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl  
Baby it'll be me, I'll be looking for you  
  
I'm gonna look in the mountains  
Down in the deep blue sea  
I'm gonna look in the forest  
And look and look in every tree  
  
If you find a new bait on your fishin' hook  
And if you find a funny face in your comic book  
Baby it'll be me I'll be lookin' for you  
(Spoken: Well, keep on lookin')  
  
I'm gonna look in the cities  
Where the lights are blue  
Gonna search the country side  
And the haystacks too  
  
Well if you see something shootin' out across the stars  
If you see a rocket ship in it's way to Mars  
Baby it'll be me  
Yeah I'll be lookin' for you  
I'll be lookin' for you  
Well, I'll be lookin' for you
