Drink the water to ease my pain  
Nights like these I only read about  
Nights like these I only dreamt about  
As we turned  
As we rolled  
I felt something strange  
I felt you  
Something light  
Something so bright  
I think it was the way of things  
I think it was the way of things  
Back come back again  
Get me a life  
Get me a life and see it in everything  
Through the dim light  
Through those dim lights  
I've fallen I'm falling falling falling falling  
In the endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life
