I'm workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna change the ending  
Throw away the title  
And toss it in the trash  
Every minute after midnight  
All the time I'm spending  
Is just for workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna turn it into cash  
  
I been workin' at the car wash  
I consider it my day job  
'Cause it's really not a pay job  
But that's where I am  
Everybody says "The old guy  
Workin' at the car wash?"  
Hasn't got a brain cell left  
Since Vietnam  
  
But I say  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
I'd no idea  
That you were there  
  
When I said help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
For listening to my prayer  
  
I'm workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna change the ending  
Gonna throw away my title

All the time I'm spending  
Is just for workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna turn it into cash  
  
I'll eliminate the pages  
Where the father has a breakdown  
And he has to leave the family  
But he really meant no harm  
Gonna substitute a car chase  
And a race across the rooftops  
Where the father saves the children  
And he holds them in his arms  
  
I said  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohh  
Thank you  
I'd no idea  
That you were there  
  
When I said  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
For listening to my prayer  
  
Workin' on my rewrite
