The name on everybody's lips is gonna be... Roxie  
The lady raking in the chips is gonna be... Roxie.  
I'm gonna be a celebrity,  
That means somebody everyone knows  
They're gonna recognise my eyes,  
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose.  
  
From just some dumb mechanic's wife I'm gonna be... Roxie  
Who says that murder's not an art.  
And who in case she doesn't hang,  
Can say she started with a bang.  
Roxie Hart.  
  
Boys...  
They're gonna wait outside in lines to get to see...  
Roxie  
Think of those autographs I'll sign, "Good luck to ya!"  
Roxie  
And I'll appear in a lavaleir that goes all the way down to my waist,  
Here a ring, there a ring every where a ring a ling  
But always in the best of taste.  
  
Mmmm, I'm a star...  
And the audience loves me,  
And I love them.  
And they love me for lovin' them  
And I love them for lovin' me  
And we love each other  
And that's 'cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods  
And that's showbiz...  
Kid  
  
She's givin' up her humdrum life  
I'm gonna be, sing it!  
Roxie  
She made a scandal and a start  
And Sophie Tucker'll shit I know  
To see her name get billed below
