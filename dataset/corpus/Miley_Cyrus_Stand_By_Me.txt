[Intro:]  
Listen to this song,  
It's about you,

I saw him,  
In the club,  
That night,  
I fell in love,  
He said,  
I know you want me,  
So let's hit the floor and party,  
Yeah

Stand by me,  
Stand by me and be my love tonight, oh!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I said let's go,  
Let's hit the floor,  
Let's get some more,  
Tonight, it's alright,  
Oh, so can you come with me  
Let's go crazy,  
Don't be lazy, oh,  
Yeah  
  
[Pre-Hook:]  
I'm not crazy,  
Let's go baby,  
Uh!

This is it,  
I choose you,  
I love you a lot,  
It's true,  
You are some one,  
I don't wanna lose,  
Yeah, baby I know you want it,  
So let's go,  
Let's lose control,  
So just  
  
[Hook:]  
Stand by me,  
Stand by me,  
Stand by me,  
Stand by me,  
Stand by me and be my love tonight, oh,  
Stand by me,  
Stand by me,
