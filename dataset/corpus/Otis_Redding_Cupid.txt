And you let your arrow go  
Straight to my lover's heart for me  
Nobody but me  
  
Cupid please hear my cry  
And let your arrow fly  
Straight to my lover's heart, its for me  
  
Now I don't need to bother you, but I'm in distress  
There's dangerous of losing all of my happiness  
But just between the two of us our love is concealed  
So help me if you will
