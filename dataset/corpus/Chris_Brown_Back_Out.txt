Ohhh yeah (x2)  
  
[Verse 1]  
Came here on a mission with one thing on my mind, my  
Mind, mind  
Yeah I came here alone, but I'm leaving here with a dime  
Shawty you're a dime, so fine  
And Girl you got my full attention, and it's something  
'Bout you  
Girl the way you wind it up, makes me want to get  
Behind you so want you oouhhh Girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl the club about to close, come over here  
Right now I'm headed to my car then to the crib  
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo  
You gone black out when I  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
  
[Verse 2]  
Imma make sure that you feel me, put your ankles where  
My ears be  
And I'm all up on you, all up on you, tryna put you to  
Bed  
Imma do it my boots, your stilettos you can leave 'em  
On  
I'm a dog, I'm a dog gimme a bone  
Act like we making babies, sexing you so crazy ohh  
Don't forget about 4  
Play with me I promise I will make it go ohh  
When I'm loving you it's like I'm swimming in a pool  
You know what it is, girl give me a kiss  
And I'm happy that you came, that's a double meaning  
Imma Sleep, Sleep, Sleep  
Your Kitty's like a Lullaby I'm so glad that I'm in it.  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl the club about to close, come over here  
Right now I'm headed to my car then to the crib  
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo  
You gone black out when I  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
  
[Bridge]  
What's your name?  
What's your age?  
Hit me later on, and maybe we can hang.  
You can call your girls, imma call my boys  
I'm choosin 'em tonight, and your my choice c'mon  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl the club about to close, come over here  
Right now I'm headed to my car then to the crib  
And baby we can leave pronto, going to my condo  
You gone black out when I  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
Blow your back out, out, out  
  
I just want to kiss you all night...
