New hit Fabulous straight from Desert Storm  
Whaaaaaat!  
  
I don't understand how niggas insist to knows bout  
How we spend car money to glist our rolls out  
Play bars and buy the cris and moes out  
Flash benjies just to twist the hoes out  
Fabolous the one from the menatti mix  
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks  
Slim nigga in a big body six  
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed  
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a???  
Down south in a town you never heard before  
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for  
??? Cats I keep burnin for furthermore  
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S  
That's gon need week rest after greekfest  
Jump in private jets just to sneak west  
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Niggas want it  
Now they get it  
Bitches on it  
Now they wit it  
Flooded up and custom fitted  
Tinted up and bb kinted  
Y'all gon wonder how we did it  
Y'all gon wonder how we get it  
Y'all gon wonder how we did it  
Y'all gon wonder how we get it  
  
Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday  
Sip lots of cherry 'Ze in a hot chevy 'Le  
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J  
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier  
What you gon do when we send shots from every way  
We got perion while y'all got perrier  
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass  
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast  
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter  
Cop a crown and put stones on a border  
Smoke the trees now that's grown underwater  
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order  
  
Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for  
Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for  
That make local cops go to feds for  
Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for

(Fabolous)  
Fabolous so cool I could play Texas  
In Avirex's light gray lexus  
Rockin white diamonds wit a gray necklace  
Fuck and bounce don't even stay for breakfast  
We doin shit that'll make maid neck twist  
Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss  
Fuck studs I'm bout to throw bagettes in my ear  
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear  
If you ain't talkin money I don't wanna chit chat  
Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat  
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for  
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore  
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first  
Doin the bump drivin a lex in reverse  
Now we don't pop it unless it's a hundred a wop  
And I'ma keep hittin y'all like an abusive pops
