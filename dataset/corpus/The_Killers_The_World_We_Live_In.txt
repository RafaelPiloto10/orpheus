This is world that we live in  
I feel myself get tired  
This is the world that we live in  
  
Well maybe I was mistaken  
I heard a rumor that you quit this day and age  
Well maybe I was mistaken  
  
Bless your body, bless your soul  
Pray for peace and self control  
  
I gotta believe it's worth it  
Without a victory,  
I'm so sanctified and free  
Well maybe I'm just mistaken  
  
Lesson learned and the wheels keep turning  
  
This is the world that we live in  
I can't take blame for two  
This is the world that we live in  
And maybe we'll make it through  
  
Bless your body, bless your soul  
Pray for peace and self-control  
  
Underneath the waterfall  
Baby we're still in this  
  
This is the world that we live in  
Feel myself get tired  
This is the world that we live in  
  
I had a dream that I was falling, down  
There's no next time, alone  
A storm wastes its water on me  
But my life was free  
  
I guess it's the world that we live in  
It's not too late for that  
This is the world that we live in  
And no, we can't go back  
  
This is the world that we live in  
We still want something real  
This is the world that we live in  
I know that  
  
This is the world that we live in
