The key turns in the door the boards squeak on the floor  
And guilty footsteps linger on the hall  
I'd fight but I'm too weak pretending I'm asleep  
While hearing guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been  
True love has no pride but he's not satisfied  
Unless he has her at his beck and call  
I know now how he works so I'll fight dirt with dirt  
To stop those guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been  
The next time she comes home she'll find herself alone  
Then she can read the writing on the wall  
I wonder if she'll take it or if she'll try to fake it  
When she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall  
Oh when she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall
