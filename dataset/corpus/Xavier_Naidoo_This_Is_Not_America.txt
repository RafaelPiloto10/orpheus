A little piece of you  
The little peace in me  
Will die for this is not America  
Blossom falls to bloom  
This season  
Promise not to stare  
Too long for this is not a miracle there was a time a storm that blew so pure  
For this could be the biggest sky  
And I could have the faintest idea snowman melting  
From the inside  
Falcon spirals  
To the ground  
So bloody red  
Tomorrows clouds a little peace of you  
The little peace in me  
Will die for this is not America there was a time  
A wind that blew so young  
For this could be the biggest sky  
And I could have the faintest idea this could be the biggest sky  
This could be a miracle  
This could be etc
