Writers: Amy Grant, Keith Thomas  
You're the kind  
When you love you love with all your might and  
You're the kind  
I would dream about at night  
Now I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
You're the kind  
That I want to be with in the dark and  
You're the kind  
Who is capturing my heart  
And I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon  
But I could never face another night or day without you  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
You're the kind  
With poetry and valentines and  
You're the kind  
Who will never ever leave  
And I'm the lucky one  
The luckiest girl  
My, my, my baby  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon  
But I could never face another night or day without you, you-hoo  
I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
I said  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Ah, my, my, my baby  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, hey, I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Ah, my, my, my baby  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Hey I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Hey I'm the lucky one
