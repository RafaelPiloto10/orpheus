Wildcat Kelley, looking mighty pale  
Was standing by the Sheriff's side  
And when the Sheriff said, "I'm sending you to jail  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the Western skies  
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
  
Wildcat Kelley, back again in town  
Was sitting by his sweetheart's side  
And when his sweetheart said, "Come on, let's settle down"  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the Western skies  
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in
