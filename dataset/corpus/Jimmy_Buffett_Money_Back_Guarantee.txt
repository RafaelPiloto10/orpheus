One day you'll be glad I came around  
I may be the best thing you have found  
Ain't much you can count on in this town  
I swear I'm speaking from my heart  
And I won't let you down.  
  
(Chorus)  
My love is guaranteed  
You're never going to see the end of me  
I've got all you need  
Like a ginsu knife or a bamboo steamer  
Late night TV hawk-eyed screamer  
You'll be the coffee I'll be the creamer  
I'm money back, money back guaranteed  
Money back, money back guaranteed  
  
I just do my best to stay alive  
Got a junked out car but you should see me drive  
Racing down St Charles Avenue  
Ain't got much but what I got  
Will sure be good for you  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Flyin' down the highway of my dreams  
You will find my crazy love  
Is always what it seems  
  
(Chorus)
