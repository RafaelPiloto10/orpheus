Pretty woman, walkin' down the street.  
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet,  
Pretty woman, I don't believe you.  
You're not the truth.  
No one could look as good as you.  
Mercy  
  
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me.  
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see,  
Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be.  
Are you lonely just like me?  
Kiss me  
  
Pretty woman stop a while.  
Pretty woman won't you talk a while.  
Pretty woman give your smile to me.  
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Pretty woman, won't you look my way.  
Pretty woman, won't you say you'll stay with me.  
  
'Cause I need you, hey I'll treat you right.  
Come with me baby, you can be mine tonight.  
Ahhhhh, ahhhh  
  
Pretty woman, hey don't walk on by.  
Pretty woman, don't make me cry.  
Pretty woman, don't you walk away, hey! Ok.  
If that's the way it must be, ok.  
I guess I'll go on home, cause it's si late.  
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait!  
What do I see?  
Is she walking back to me?  
Yeah, she's walking back to me!  
Wohoo pretty woman!
