Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'  
Though your nose gets chillin'  
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland
