Chorus:  
Pumpkin patch, pumpkin patch,  
Headin' out to the pumpkin patch  
Pumpkin patch, pumpkin patch  
Headin' out to the pumpkin patch  
  
Pumpkins are pretty sneaky, they like to hide in the fields  
Under a leaf, under a bush, they keep perfectly still  
It's a good thing that they're orange, or they'd be hard to see  
Gonna catch me one of them pumpkins, a special one for me.  
  
Chorus  
  
Pumpkins aren't very scary, unless you give them a face  
A smile or a frown, eyes up or down, teeth all over the place  
Gonna carve me one of them pumpkins, put a candle inside to burn  
Then instead of a pumpkin, it'll be a jack o'lantern  
  
Hey hey, I'm goin' today, hay ride hang on...  
Hey hey, what can I say,  
Gotta catch 'em before they're gone.  
  
Chorus  
So if you happen to see a pumpkin,  
When you're out on hallowe'en night  
Don't stop and stare, you better beware  
He'll give you an awful fright.  
Just keep on trick or treating, don't even say hello  
He might jump up, and follow you home,  
You just never know!  
  
Chorus
