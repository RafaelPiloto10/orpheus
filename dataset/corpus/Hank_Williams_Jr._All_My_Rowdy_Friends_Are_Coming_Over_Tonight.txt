I got ketchup on my blue jeans, I just burnt my hand  
Lord, it's hard to be a bachelor man  
I got girls that can cook, I got girls that can clean  
I got girls that can do anything in between  
I got to get ready, make everything right  
Cause all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight  
  
Do you want a drink, hey, do you want to party  
Hey, honey, this is ole Hank, ready to get the thing started  
We cooked the pig in the ground, got some beer on ice  
And all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight  
  
Now, my party pad is out in the woods  
It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood  
But I got some natural queens out on the floor  
And ole Miss Mississippi just walked through the door  
Got a little wirlpool just made for ten  
And you can jump out and you can jump in  
You can do anything that you wanna do  
But, uh-uhh, don't you step on my cowboy boots  
  
Do you want to drink, hey do you want to party  
Hey, this is ole Hank, ready to get this summer started  
I cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice  
And all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight  
  
Do you want to drink, hey, do you want to party  
Hey, hey, this is rockin, Randall Hank  
Ready to get the summer time started  
We cooked the pig in the ground  
We got some beer on ice  
All my rowdy friends are comin over tonight  
That's right, come on in
