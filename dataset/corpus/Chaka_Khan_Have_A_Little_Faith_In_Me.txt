When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
And have a little faith in me.  
  
When the tears you cry  
Are all you can believe.  
Give these loving arms a try  
And have a little faith in me.  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
Can not speak so easily  
Let a whisper become a start  
And have a little faith in me  
  
And when your back's against the wall  
Just turn around you will see  
I will catch you, I will catch your fall, baby  
Just have some faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Faith in me  
  
I've been loving you such a long time boy  
Expected nothing in return.  
Just for you to have a little faith faith in me  
Time is our friend.  
  
And all you gotta do is have a little faith in me.  
I said,  
I will hold you up, I will hold you up.  
Your love gives me stength enough.  
  
Have a little faith in me, oh  
Have a little faith in me.
