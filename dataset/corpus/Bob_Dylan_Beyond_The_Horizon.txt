Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you
