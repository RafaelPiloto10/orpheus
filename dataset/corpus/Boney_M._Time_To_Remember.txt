I tried so very hard not to cry  
I kept hanging around to forget all the good things  
We both used to do  
(Time to remember the nights without you)  
  
No, no, no one can take your place, how I love  
I miss your embrace, I'm a prisoner of love  
Waiting for you it's true  
(Time to remember, I'm lost without you)  
Time to remember the nights without you)  
  
Oh, let's get it together, I know that you'll soon understand  
We're wasting time 'cause love's hard to find  
Oh, how could we both be so blind? Oh, babe  
  
I've been losing control, I've been told  
But I, I must touch your soul  
If I go out with you, I don't mind if I do  
(Time to remember I'm lost without you)  
  
I tried so very hard not to cry  
I kept hanging around to forget all the good things  
We both used to do  
(Time to remember the nights without you)  
  
No, no, no one can take your place, how I love  
I miss your embrace, I'm a prisoner of love, waiting for you it's true  
(Time to remember I'm lost without you)  
Time to remember the nights without you  
(Time to remember the nights without you)
