Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely eyes,  
lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face,  
lonely lonely in your place.  
  
I thought that I knew all that there was to,  
lonely, lonely, lonely  
  
Melanie Jane, won't feel the pain.  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes,  
lonely lonely in your place.  
  
And I thought that I knew all that there was to  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes,  
lonely lonely in your place, and  
I still love you, I still love you,  
lonely, lonely
