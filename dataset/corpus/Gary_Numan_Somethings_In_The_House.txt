Memories lost in the faded films  
Of my life  
And a friend that used to be  
Something special to me  
Red wine and good times  
If you don't feel at all  
There is no point in going on tonight  
Something's in the house  
Something's on the stairs  
War's in the air  
The queer is out of order  
And me I'm on the ground  
But that's no place to be  
  
Jack Burroughs says "what you doing"  
"Oh me I'm going home"  
"Oh what a shame"  
Nothing has changed  
And nothing is new  
These days
