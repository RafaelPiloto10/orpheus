Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand  
All your little whims and wishes all the time  
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man  
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine  
  
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear  
When I jokingly said come and be my bride  
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth  
That I have you dear forever by my side  
[ steel ]  
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before  
Only God can know and time alone will tell  
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul  
And pray God to let it last if it's his will  
  
So don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand  
All your little whims and wishes all the time  
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man  
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
