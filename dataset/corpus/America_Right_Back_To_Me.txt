Wherever I go it's coming back to me  
Whoever I've known they sent it back to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I put on a show, it's very clear to me  
And when I am low I feel you're near to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I recall some years ago, when I truly was alone  
Now at last all that is past  
Now I'm never on my own.  
I know my light will be shining bright  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true ...
