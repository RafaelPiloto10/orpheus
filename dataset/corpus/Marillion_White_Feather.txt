When I hit the streets back in '81  
Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown  
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears  
Where have I been for all these years?  
I saw political intrigue, political lies  
Gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes  
  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But I'm proud to own my heart  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But I'm proud to own my heart  
My heart, this is my heart  
  
We don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise  
Divided we stand, together we'll rise  
  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But we're proud to own our hearts  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But we're proud to own our hearts  
These are our hearts  
These are our hearts  
You can't take away our hearts  
You can't steal our hearts away  
I can't walk away  
No more
