You looked around but it wasn't there  
You can't ignore the voice of reason  
"You can't be what you want, so you better be what you are"  
You fought your way to an inch of freedom  
You did your best and they didn't care  
You've had your share and you have your reasons  
"You can't be what you want, so you better be what you are"  
  
So we begin our story  
Beleaguered and taken down  
Everybody wants a piece of what's going on  
Afraid you'll become dull and boring  
In a suit that doesn't fit  
Everybody wants a piece of what's going on  
You can't mean what you said  
You're not sorry for a word of it  
Everybody wants to get ahead  
Now it's not too late to say you're sorry  
  
You're alright  
The Compromise  
You've backed yourself into a corner  
You looked around and it wasn't there  
You're such a sucker for superstition  
You can't be what you are  
So you better be what you want
