Tried to make it little by little  
Tried to make it bit by bit on my own.  
Quit the job, the grey believers  
Another town where I get close to the bone.  
  
Whatcha gonna tell your brother?  
Oh oh oh  
Whatcha gonna tell your father?  
I don't know!  
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?  
Let me go...  
  
I'm gonna get dressed for success  
Shaping me up for the big time, baby.  
Get dressed for success  
Shaping it up for your love yea yea yea.  
  
I'm not afraid  
A trembling flower  
I'll feed your heart  
And blow the dust from your eyes and  
In the dark things happen faster.  
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine.  
  
I'm gonna get dressed for success  
Hitting a spot for the big time, baby.  
Get dressed for success  
Shaping it up for your love. Look sharp!
