Woman goes to heaven, it's not important when  
'Cause as soon as she arrives God has to send her down again  
?You've got an extra five years to clean up after men?  
?I mean no disrespect God, but you better make it ten?  
  
Well if heaven's an improvement I won't mind the extra squeeze  
I've got a few more birds down there, after losing bees  
Trying to lose their bees  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
  
Alcoholic finds himself outside the pearly gates  
I've only got one worry God, a few outstanding slates  
Any tab you used to have been passed to so called mates  
And after they've paid-up they're off to the land of empty crates  
  
Heaven is a glass, neither half empty nor half full  
So do us all a favor God and give that thing a pull  
Give that thing a pull  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become the well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
  
Model turns up hours late, he had to get it right  
If you're gonna look cool in heaven wear something more than white  
Vanity's close to arrogance, just slightly more polite  
Fashion show a jumble sale at a slightly different height  
At a slightly different height  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become the well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
The gates, the gates
