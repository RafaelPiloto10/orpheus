Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama  
I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land  
A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand  
  
Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man  
Well I can sing I can dance I can play the harmonica too  
I got a brand new thing on the South Side Montgomery Blues  
You better stick around and watch me cause I'm an entertainin' fool  
  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...  
Well I learned my trade from that rag-poppin' daddy o'mine  
He shined twelve alligators made a hundred dollar bill one time  
And when the meat gets scarce I shine two or three pairs for a dime  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...  
  
I had a girl that helped me she had a lotta hoochy coochy ways  
She was bumping and grinding paid that girl a dollar a day  
But she was shy on age and the law come and took her away  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...
