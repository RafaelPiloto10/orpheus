Headcase baby  
She's a cool kind of crazy  
Wild and she's willing  
Into early Dylan  
  
She drives me crazy,  
Oh yeah, ooh ooh yea  
  
When I look into her big brown eyes  
I'm so glad to know she's mine  
My little headcase, yeah Ooh, ooh,  
Yeah, my little headcase, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah  
  
Heidi is a headcase, a rebel and a rouser  
Cranks up her Rickenbacker  
Blasts away for hours  
What's she doin' now on the escalator  
Snorting up some speed on the picture of or Stiv Bators  
  
What 'cha doin'?  
  
When I look into her big brown eyes  
I'm so glad to know she's mine  
My little headcase, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, my little headcase, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah  
  
Ooh, baby baby, whatever you do now  
Don't ever go away  
  
Ooh, baby baby, whatever you do now  
Don't you ever go astray  
Don't you ever go away - ooh, ooh, yea  
Don't you ever go away - ooh, ooh, yea  
  
Heidi is a headcase  
Heidi is a headcase  
Heidi is a headcase  
Heidi is a headcase
