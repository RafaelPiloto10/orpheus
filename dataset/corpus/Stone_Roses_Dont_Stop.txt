Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Here the sea spray give  
I was with her  
We're under the ship so get me over  
  
Now that was me, listen  
Now she fishes now, listen  
There was no one out there we used  
There is the news for me useless  
  
Now so much waste  
How we'll be teased  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
  
Oh won't you just ask me you're an imbecile  
What's the matter for everyone I feel  
Pain, blues singer  
He's playing just a guitar from the top  
  
I wake I still look I feel loose  
We're all here now who'se the first ease into my heart  
He must be one of us  
  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?
