When I was a boy in the days of the train  
I'd sit by the tracks on a long summer day  
And I'd wave at the brakesman  
And he'd wave back at me  
While the thunderclouds rolled  
Out of East Tennessee  
  
But the dreams of a boy disappear when you're grown  
And though I may dream, the railroads are gone  
The ties they are rotten  
And the tracks shot to hell  
Along with my dreams and the old railroad bell  
  
In my dreams I ride the rails to California  
Workin' diners and farms along the way  
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border  
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way  
  
Now the mountains are silent  
And the railroads are gone  
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn  
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me  
While the thunderclouds roll out of East Tennessee  
  
In my dreams I ride the rails to California  
Workin' diners and farms along the way  
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border  
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way  
  
Now the mountains are silent  
And the railroads are gone  
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn  
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me  
While the thunderclouds roll out of East Tennessee
