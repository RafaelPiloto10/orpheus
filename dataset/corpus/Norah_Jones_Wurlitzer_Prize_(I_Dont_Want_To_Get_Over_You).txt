Don't want to get over you  
I'm not here to forget you, I'm here to recall  
The things we used to say and do  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
I haunt the same places we used to go  
Alone at a table for two  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
They ought to give me the Wurlitzer prize  
For all the silver I led slide down the slot  
Playing those songs sung blue  
Help me remember you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
A fresh roll of quarters, same old song  
Missing you through and through  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you
