Well the news spread through Jerusalem, tonight a child is born  
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and Angels blowin' horns  
But in their golden halls the Pharasees  
Scoffed and drank their wine  
They said it's only Hebrew prophesy  
We don't care and besides He just a kid  
That's all He is  
One more pebble in the gravel  
One more rumor in the ravel  
How can He be king?  
He's just a kid.  
  
Well in no time He seen the world was knockin' on His door  
Performed miracles and wonders they had never see before  
Soon the Pharasees stopped laughin  
The silver sun was paid  
And near the end He knelt down in the garden and He prayed:  
  
I'm just a kid  
That's all I am  
I'll need Your strength too see me through it  
If it is Your will I'll do it  
But how can I be king I'm just a kid?  
  
Now I think about the Baby and the Man at Christmas time  
Of mother's, son's and father's and children just like mine  
About the power in unselfishness, love and sacrifice  
The Gift that we were given and the price.  
  
And how the news spread through Jerusalem, tonight a child is born  
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and angels blowin' horns  
I wonder how on Earth the Pharasees, could scoff and drink their wine  
And say He's only Hebrew prophesy  
We don't care and besides He's just a kid  
That's all He is  
One more pebble in the gravel  
One more rumor in the ravel  
And how can He be king? He's just a kid  
  
Oh how can He be king?  
He's just a kid.  
Ooh.
