You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you  
  
You can steal my love, and go away  
Don't tell me you'll see me another day  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you  
  
You've gone and left me,  
You left me here to cry  
You know I love you,  
You know you might sigh  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you  
  
I gave you all my money,  
Everything too  
A fine Cadillac, tell me,  
  
Whatcha gonna do  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself  
You got to watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you  
  
Well the people are all talkin',  
All over town  
Say you don't love me,  
You're gonna let me down  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you  
  
Tell me what's the matter,  
Whatcha gonna do?  
Well you're gonna quit me,  
Then you say you're thru  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself  
You better watch yourself,  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
