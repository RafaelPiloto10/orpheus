It's been so long darling since I had to go away  
It's been so long darling and I'll never forget that day  
Although I never mentioned it I cried the whole day long  
It's been so long darling but now you're comin' home  
It's been so long darling but it won't be long now  
It's been so long darling and I've kept every vow  
He'll sign me right here waitin' as you did in days gone by  
It's been so long darling please don't blame me if I cry  
[ steel ]  
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes  
It's been so long darling do you really realize  
That's just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through  
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you  
It's been so long darling but now you're comin' home
