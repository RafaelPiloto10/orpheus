Feuding and fussing and a-fighting  
Sometimes it gets to be exciting  
Don't like them ornery neighbors down by the creek  
We'll be plumb out of neighbors next week  
  
Grandma, poor old grandma  
Why'd they have to shoot poor grandma  
She lies 'neath the clover  
Someone caught her bending over  
  
Picking up a daisy  
Feuding and fussing and a-fighting  
This is a wrong that needs a righting  
Let's get that funeral service over  
So then we can start in a-feuding again  
  
Feuding and fighting and a-fussing  
That's all that's going on with using  
We are such neighborly people peaceful and sweet  
All except when we happen to meet  
Daughter, baby daughter  
  
Poisoned all the neighbors chickens  
Daughter hadn't oughter  
Least until she could run like the dickens  
They hit her with a shovel  
  
Feuding and fighting and a-fussing  
No use a-standing here a-cussing  
Let's give our daughter a pistol now that she's four  
And go feuding and fighting some more
