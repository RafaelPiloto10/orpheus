I got a job in Atlanta in a mall playing Santa  
Not because of any talent but because I was the  
only one the suit would fit  
Everybody shopping, little sticky kids were hopping  
on my lap with their fingers in my beard  
I guess they thought that I was really it  
  
She sat down on my lap and said to me  
"I'm twenty three and I need someone  
You look like someone who could play with me  
Stay with me, all day with me"  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
I'm gonna show you a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line  
Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know... Hmmmm  
  
I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying  
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear  
I never heard such profanity  
  
I dropped my suit on the floor  
they were trying to block the door  
They were calling her a whore  
They were driven to nativities insanity  
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze  
She said "I want to put you under my tree  
You're just a little gift from me to me"  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
You know I'm ready for a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She had money all her life  
She wasn't lookin' to become my wife  
She said, "I hope you understand  
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny"  
  
She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin  
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities  
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes  
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality  
  
She said "Come and lay down on the floor with me  
It's warmer here by the fire"  
She didn't know that there was more of me  
She'd have to learn to love all four of me  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
I'm lookin' for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Hey, I'm in no mans land  
I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Oh, I'm in no man's land  
I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me
