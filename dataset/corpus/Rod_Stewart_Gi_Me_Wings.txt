Driving in my car  
There's nothing on the air  
Play a song that'll ease my pain  
DJ's telling me  
That this is what'll be  
Help me I'm depressed again  
  
My best friend disappeared  
With the girl I had for years  
My life's going down the drain  
The skies are crying  
Everybody's lying  
Oh God I'm depressed again  
  
Give me wings I'll fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
There's gotta be a place for me  
  
The boss is on my back  
I know I'm gonna crack  
Looks like I'm paranoid again  
Can't do nothing right  
See only black and white  
Oh God I'm depressed again  
  
Give me wings I'll fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
There's gotta be a place for me  
  
How can I plan ahead  
With this hanging round my neck  
Looks like I'm coming down again  
Thought about it well  
Analyzed myself  
Yeah, I'm depressed again  
  
Give me wings I'll fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
There's gotta be a place for me  
I'm down, I'm coming down again  
I'm down, looks like I'm coming down again  
I'm down, I'm down  
Looks like I'm coming down again  
I'm down, I'm down  
Looks like I'm pissed off again
