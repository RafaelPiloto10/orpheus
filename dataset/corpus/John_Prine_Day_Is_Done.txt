Do you like me?  
Well I hope you do  
Cause if you like me  
Then I think I'm gonna to have to like you too  
  
We'll share our things  
And have some fun  
Then we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
If you tell me  
I'll tell you too  
And we'll say the things  
And do the things that lovers do  
  
We'll keep it to ourselves  
We won't hurt no one  
Then we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
We'll carve our names  
On a tree  
Then we'll burn it down  
So no one in the world will see  
  
And we'll make love  
While we watch the flame  
Then we'll walk away  
As if we never had no shame  
  
Now we must hide  
To be alone  
And we can't say  
Our sweet things on the telephone  
  
If we can't stop  
What we've begun  
We should say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
Do you still like me?  
Well I hope you do  
Cause if you still like me  
Then I think I'm gonna have to still like you  
  
We shared our things  
And had some fun  
Now we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
Yeah, we'll say goodbye  
And go back home while  
We still have one  
Let's say goodbye and go back home  
Now the day is done
