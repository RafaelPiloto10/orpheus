No one to talk with, all by myself  
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Now I know for certain, you're the one I love  
I'm through with flirtin', just you I'm dreamin' of  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
Don't go no where, why do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waiting for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, I don't care to go  
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
Don't go no where, why do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waiting for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, I don't care to go  
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you
