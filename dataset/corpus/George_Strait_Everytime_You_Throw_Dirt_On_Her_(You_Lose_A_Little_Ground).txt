I guess you think it's fun  
To laugh at her expense  
And point out each mistake she makes  
In front of all your friends  
You figure she'll let it go by  
Cause she loves you so  
But, you know  
  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
She slips a little farther away  
Each time that you put her down  
A lady like that can come here and get  
Somebody who knows what he's found  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
  
It's hard to bite my lip  
But, I ain't saying a word  
I give you all the rope to hang yourself  
That you deserve  
You might be ahead of me in her heart today  
But, that's okay  
  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
She slips a little farther away  
Each time that you put her down  
A lady like that can come here and get  
Somebody who knows what he's found  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
She slips a little farther away  
Each time that you put her down  
A lady like that can come here and get  
Somebody who knows what he's found  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground  
She slips a little farther away  
Each time that you put her down  
A lady like that can come here and get  
Somebody who knows what he's found  
Every time you throw dirt on her  
You lose a little ground
