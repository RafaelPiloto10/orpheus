I bust the windows out your car  
And it didn't mend my broken heart  
I'll probably always have these ugly scars  
But right now I don't care about that part.  
I bust the windows out your car  
After I saw you looking right at her  
I didn't wanna but I took my turn  
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how you'd felt when you saw it  
I didn't know that I had that much strength  
But I'm glad you see what happens when  
You see you can't just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them and don't mean it  
You'll probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile ha, ha, ha, ha,  
  
I bust the windows out ya car  
You know I did it cause I left my mark  
Wrote my initials with the crowbar  
And then I drove off into the dark  
  
I bust the windows out ya car ha,  
You should feel lucky that was all I did  
After five whole years of this bullshit  
Gave you all of me and you played with it  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it  
I didn't know that I had that much strength  
But I'm glad you see what happens when  
You see you can't just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them but don't mean it  
You probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile  
Bust windows out your car  
But it don't come back to my broken heart  
You could neva' feel I how I felt that day  
Until it happens baby you don't know pain  
Ooh Yeah I did it (yeah I did it)  
You should know it (you should know it)  
I ain't sorry (I ain't sorry)  
You deserved it (you deserved it)  
After what you did to me (after what you did)  
You deserve it (you deserve it)  
I ain't sorry no no oh (I ain't sorry)  
You broke my heart so I broke you car  
You caused me pain (you caused me pain)  
(So I did the same)  
Even though what you did to me was much worse  
I had to do something to make you hurt  
Oh but why am I still crying  
Why am I the one who's still crying  
Oh oh you really hurt me baby  
You really, you really hurt me baby  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Now watch me you  
Now watch me  
Oh I bust the windows out your car.
