Getting my facts from a Benneton ad  
I'm lookin' thru African eyes  
Lit by the glare of an L. A. Fire  
Black tie white noise  
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe  
  
Putting on the black tie  
  
Crankin up the white noise  
  
Sun comes up and the man goes down  
And the woman comes again  
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear  
Black tie white noise  
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear  
  
Putting on the black tie  
  
Crankin up the white noise  
  
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands  
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"  
Whoa! What's going on?  
There'll be some blood no doubt about it  
But we'll come thru don't doubt it  
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me  
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
You won't kill me no  
But I look into your eyes  
And I wonder sometimes  
  
Putting on the black tie  
  
Crankin up the white noise  
  
Oh Lord, just let him see me  
Lord, Lord just let him hear me  
Let him call me brother  
Let him put his arms around me  
Let him put his hands together.  
  
Reach out over race and hold each other's hands  
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world  
Whoa! What's going on?  
There will be some blood no doubt about it  
But we'll come thru don't doubt it  
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me  
And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
You won't kill me no  
But I wonder why  
Yes, I wonder why sometimes  
  
Putting on the black tie  
  
Crankin up the white noise  
  
They'll show us how to break the rules  
But never how to make the rules  
Reduce us down to witless punks  
Black tie white noise  
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.  
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out white noise  
  
Black tie white noise  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out  
  
Putting on the black tie  
  
Cranking up the white noise  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out white noise  
  
Black tie white noise  
  
Cranking out  
  
Cranking out
