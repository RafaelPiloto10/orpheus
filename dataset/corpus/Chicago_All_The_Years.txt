You ask me what I think,  
I tell you you ignore it.  
The reasons for it make me crazy.  
You ask me what is right,  
Huh, you never hear it.  
You're never nowhere near it baby.  
I spent my life believing,  
It would not end this way.  
  
[Chorus]  
All the Years we wasted  
All the Years we tried  
All the restless hours  
All the times we cried.  
  
You ask me what I want,  
I got no answer.  
I know I'm only dancing faster.  
So now we're stuck with us,  
With you and all your stories.  
Who's the fool and who'd the liar.  
I spent my life believing  
It would not end this way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the years we gambled.  
All the years you lied.  
All the hopeless dreamers.  
All the dreams that died.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats till fade]
