Take my life and paint it black  
Until I'm sleeping  
And my promise, I take it back  
So please stop creeping  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
Stay until the curfew calls  
And kiss your idol  
Beneath your black hair waterfalls  
You look so bridal  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
You know my name  
(My scarlet name)  
You don't know me
