My feelings are burning with fear  
I know someone?s in here, I just can?t see  
I silently follow the sound  
Little footsteps are moving in the hall  
With the candle still in my hand  
I take a look at the mirror on the wall  
I cannot see myself  
I don?t even see the hallway that I?m in  
I see a girl in a bloody dress  
Standing in the cellar down below  
[Solo : Mike]  
I cannot see myself  
I don?t even see the hallway that I?m in  
I see a girl in a bloody dress  
Standing in the cellar down below  
Mirror Mirror? Mirror in the hall  
Ah-Ah? Mirror Mirror? Ah-Ah? The mirror on the wall? NO  
Why are you here?  
What are you looking for in this house? is it me?  
Why are your hands so full of blood?  
Oh it?s in your hair too? Good God  
I cannot tell in the colour of night  
If she is dressed in red or bloody white? oh the night  
Little girl your hair is such a mess  
Little girl what are those marks on your neck? Are you dead?  
[Solo : Andy]  
Mirror Mirror? Mirror in the hall  
Ah-Ah? Mirror Mirror? Ah-Ah? The mirror on the wall  
My feelings are burning with fear  
I know someone?s in here, the girl is near  
[Solo : Andy]  
Now I can see the bloody smear on the wall  
I see the crucifix hanging upside down  
Another look at the mirror on the wall  
I cannot see myself  
I don?t even see the hallway that I?m in  
I see a girl in a bloody dress  
Standing in the cellar down below  
Mirror Mirror? Mirror in the hall  
Ah-Ah? Mirror Mirror? Ah-Ah? The mirror on the wall  
Through the mirror on the wall  
Blood is dripping on my floor
