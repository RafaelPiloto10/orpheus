It won't be easy  
You'll think it strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love  
After ll that I've done  
You won't believe me  
All you will see  
Is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressd up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen  
I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun  
So I chose freedom  
Running around trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it too  
  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions  
They promise to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
Have I said to much?  
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you  
But all you have to do  
Is look at me to know  
That every word is true
