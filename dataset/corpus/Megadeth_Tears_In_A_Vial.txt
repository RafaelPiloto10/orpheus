This may seem all too confusing  
How I could walk away from something so rare  
But you see it all got too demanding, yeah  
And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared  
Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you  
Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh  
And it sucks to be taken for granted  
When the veil is drawn and there's only air  
  
I had to walk away  
Give up something I love  
For what I loved even more  
And save my tears for you  
  
Everything has lost its meaning, I had to let it go  
To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new  
Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am  
Now it's just me, cause I can't afford you  
  
I had to walk away  
Give up something I love  
For what I loved even more  
And save my tears for you  
I gave up something I loved  
For what I loved even more  
And I saved my tears for you  
In a vial and walked away  
  
You were so beautiful to look upon  
I could see the light in your smile  
Your eyes were the windows into your soul  
Your body was heavenly just like the sky  
  
Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much  
Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long  
Your eyes are empty windows: broken  
The body may be here, but the soul is gone  
  
I saved my tears for you in a vial  
From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said  
To send away, buried with your love  
So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone,  
And now that you're dead
