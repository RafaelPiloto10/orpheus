So you went to a party at Jacqualine Onassis  
If you're so smart why don't you wear glasses  
So you can see what you're doin' to me  
So you can see what you're doin' to me  
So you can see what tomorrow might bring  
  
Underneath your breath you know I heard you cussin'  
You were talkin' to my second cousin  
Were you talkin' about me  
Were you talkin' about me  
You better put on your glasses so you can see  
So you can see what tomorrow might bring  
  
Can your daddy get us backstage passes  
You know that we love to dance  
Can your daddy give us backstage passes  
With all his political power  
With all his political power  
It seems to me like you could dance better than you do  
  
So you went to a party at Jacqualine Onassis  
If you're so smart why don't you wear glasses  
So you can see what the future might bring  
So you can see what tomorrow might be
