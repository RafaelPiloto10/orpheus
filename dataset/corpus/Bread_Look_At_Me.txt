I'm driftin' down the street  
Asking of all i meet  
Don't you know me from somewhere  
Hazel eyes and curly hair  
Have you seen me anywhere  
Look at me  
I'm blending into the wall  
And i wonder if i'm really here at all  
  
Time goes by  
So do i  
But no one blinks an eye  
Mirrors aren't reflecting me  
Laws aren't protecting  
And no one's expecting me  
On the edge  
I feel like i'm going to fall  
And i wonder if i'll never land at well  
  
Loneliness comes and stays  
Torturing nights and days  
People stare but cannot speak  
Hearts are strong  
But tongues are weak  
Maybe all our minds are meek  
Look at me  
I'm fading into the floor  
And wonder if i'm living anymore.
