Lookin' like another Bob Marley day  
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train  
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon  
  
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall  
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked 'em all  
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon  
  
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor  
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more  
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just sitting around, hangin' out this afternoon  
  
Landlord says I should buy a tent  
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent  
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon  
  
Down on the corner in a seedy bar  
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR  
Had a few, to Suzy Q this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
  
Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock  
To see what time it is  
From the moment I wake up  
I just love being with my friends  
We barely get by but have the best times  
And hope it never ends  
We drink all day until we fall down  
So we can do it all again  
  
It's not the human walk  
It's the human race  
If you ain't livin' on edge  
You're takin' too much space  
So I doubt I'll figure out  
Just what to do  
'Bout to kick it around  
Hanging out this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Just sitting around  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
