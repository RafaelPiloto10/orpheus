Sweet dreams are made of these  
Who am I to disagree?  
Traveled the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
Sweet dreams are made of these  
Who am I to disagree?  
Traveled the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
I wanna use you and abuse you  
I wanna know what's inside you  
  
Keep your head up, moving on  
Hold your head up, moving on  
Keep your head up, moving on  
Hold your head up, moving on  
Keep your head up, moving on  
Moving on  
  
Sweet dreams are made of these  
Who am I to disagree?  
Travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody looking for something  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
I'm gonna use you and abuse you  
I've gotta know what's inside  
Can I use you and abuse you?  
I've gotta know what's inside you
