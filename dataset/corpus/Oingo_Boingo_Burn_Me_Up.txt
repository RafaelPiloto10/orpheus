[verse 1]  
I would like to be a martyr  
Over time it's getting harder  
Who do I have to go and kill  
To get my face on a dollar bill.  
[chorus 1]  
Every single time I look  
Someone else has beat me to it  
Some poor bastard bites the dust  
I really don't know who to trust.  
But there's one thing I can't deny  
I'd rather it was me they fried  
Have a drink from an empty cup  
Light a match and burn me up.  
[verse 2]  
I'm exhausted, I'm committed,  
I'm outsmarted, I'm out witted.  
My head's filled with dynamite  
It's coming out of my ears at night.  
[chorus 2]  
I think I am being watched  
Electric eyes that never turn off.  
Radar beams insinuating  
Evil thoughts while I'm masturbating.  
And even my old trinitron,  
It's comin through when nothing's on.  
Have a drink from an empty cup,  
Light a match and burn me up.
