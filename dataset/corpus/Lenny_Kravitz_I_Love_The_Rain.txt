[Verse 1]  
The clouds are forming  
She comes again  
I'll go and walk with her  
Along the Seine  
Soon she'll be storming  
Here comes the wind  
But that don't bother me  
'Cause she's my friend  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've held our memories  
All of these years  
So many good times  
And many tears  
I share my dreams with her  
I share my fears  
So I just walk with her until she veers  
Off in the distance  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh  
Just as she always does  
She has to leave  
With her she takes my heart  
Into her breeze  
Sometimes I think that she  
Just likes to tease  
Still I'll be waiting  
For her reprise  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah
