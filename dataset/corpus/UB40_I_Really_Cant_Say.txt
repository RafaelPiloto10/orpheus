[Chorus]  
I really can't say  
How I feel right now  
I would if I could  
But I don't know how  
Just give me some time  
And I'll come around  
I'll pick myself up  
I'll dust myself down  
  
Let's leave it at that  
I don't want to fight  
Don't say anything that you may regret  
In fact, it's the last thing I need tonight  
Your words in my head are hard to forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's leave it for now  
Let's call it a day  
We don't have to talk about this anymore  
That look on you face gave it all away  
We've traveled these roads many times before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's leave it alone  
Before it's too late  
Give it a rest for a moment or two  
We can pick it back up at a later date  
If you feel that's what you have to do  
  
[Chorus: x4]
