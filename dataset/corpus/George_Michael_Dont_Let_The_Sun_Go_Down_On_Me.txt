i can't light no more of your darkness  
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
  
It's much too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when i met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
Ladies and gentlemen Mr. Elton John  
I can't find  
Oh, the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way feel  
Don't discard me baby don't  
Just because you think i mean you harm  
Just because you think i mean you harm, oh  
But these cuts i have, cuts i have  
They need love  
They need love, they need love to help them heal  
  
Oh, don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i that see, yeah  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh  
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me
