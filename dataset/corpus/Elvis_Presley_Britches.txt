Beware of a gal in britches  
Yo-di-o-di-o  
Never trust no gal in britches  
No-di-o-di-o  
If you had a sense of this here horse  
You would have known it by now of course  
Who wears the britches is the boss  
That's a gal, that's a gal in britches  
  
Don't mess with a gal in britches  
Yo-di-o-di-o  
No feminine gal wears britches  
No-di-o-di-o  
She'll beg you to come to the country dance  
You ride twenty miles for the big romance  
She shows up in her brother's pants  
What'd you expect from a girl in britches  
  
Yo-di-o-di-o-i-ay, It's none of my misfortune  
Yo-di-o-di-o-di-ay, Just thought you'd like to know  
Don't marry no gal in britches  
Yo-di-o-di-o  
You'll never know which is which's  
No-di-o-di-o  
She'll put a halter through your nose  
Have you cooking and washing clothes  
While she goes chasing them buffaloes  
Bet your boots, that's a gal in britches.
