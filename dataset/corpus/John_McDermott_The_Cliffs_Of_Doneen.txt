The Cliffs of Dooneen: To Izabella and Tadeusz  
You may travel far from your own native home  
Far away o'er the mountains far away o'er the foam  
But of all the fine places that I've ever been  
There's none can compare with the cliffs of Dooneen  
It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day  
Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay  
Oh the hare and the pheasant are plain to be seen  
Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Dooneen  
Take a view o'er the mountain fine sites you'll see there  
Yes in a high rocky mountain in the west coast of Clair  
Oh the towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen  
From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Dooneen  
So fare thee well to Dooneen fare thee well for a while  
And althoug we are parted by the ragin sea wild  
Once again I will wander with my Irisjh colleen  
Round the high rocky slopes of the cliffs of Dooneen
