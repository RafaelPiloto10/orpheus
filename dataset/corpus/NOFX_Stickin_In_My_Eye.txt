When I look 'round, I only see outta one eye  
As the smoke surrounds my head, the sauna  
I hear the voices, but I can't make out their words  
Saying things, saying things that  
  
I got something sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye  
I feel unusual from thinking  
About the underground decay, God help me  
  
Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry  
It's not from pity, it comes from  
What's been sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye
