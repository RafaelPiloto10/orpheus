I saw your friend 1st  
That's who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin' you  
  
The music rocked us  
Our eyes locked-thus  
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
You whispered something  
It took my mind out like a  
G flat major with an E in the bass  
Your face looked so good  
I wanted to touch your mouth  
My brain is jackin' all over the place  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
Let's take a drive, love  
So we can make up our minds, love  
To commit the crimes of passion  
That sets us free  
Me lovin' you, you lovin' me (me lovin' you, you lovin' me)  
  
The electric chair  
  
I saw your friend 1st  
That's who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin' you (I was watchin' you)  
The music rocked us  
Our lives shocked us  
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo  
I've got to have it  
Somebody  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
You know I'm guilty, yeah, (for all my future crimes)  
Guilty, (for all my future crimes)  
And if ya don't really love me  
(Then give me the electric chair) oh!  
  
Electric chair
