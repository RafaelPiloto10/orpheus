I held you tight, and we fell, life took a breath  
Made me weep, blanket kissed your lips  
And I know that it tasted just like it felt  
I'd never see all this happen to me  
But it feels like love, makes me weep like love  
And it tastes just like it's got to be love  
Oh it's in the air, I feel it everywhere  
I'm so happy 'cause I know it's got to be love  
No two ways about it, it's got to be love  
  
I look at you, and it looks like it when you talk  
Oh it sounds like it deep inside  
All my thoughts and my heart say it's so  
Still I've got to be sure 'cause I've been fooled before  
But it looks like love and it sounds like love  
And my heart tells me it's got to be love  
Oh it's in the air, I feel it everywhere  
I'm so happy 'cause I know it's got to be love  
No two ways about it, it's got to be love
