I have a love and it's all that I have  
Right or wrong, what else can I do ?  
I love him, I'm his,  
And every thing he is  
I am, too.  
  
I have a love and he's all that I need,  
Right or wrong, and he needs me, too.  
I love him, we're one.  
There's nothing to be done.  
Not a thing I can do  
  
But hold him,  
Hold him forever.  
Be with him now  
Tomorrow and all of my life.  
  
When love comes so strong  
There is no right or wrong.  
Your love is your own.
