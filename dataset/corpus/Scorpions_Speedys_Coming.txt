You look at a poster  
You look at the wall  
The wall in the room where you live  
Where you live with your stars  
Just listen to his records  
Now hear what he says  
For he says, "I love you little girl  
Come to see me today"  
  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
  
You like Alice Cooper  
You like Ringo Starr  
You like David Bowie  
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall  
Stick up the pictures, movies, TV  
And I'll bring you the show little girl  
Come to see me today  
  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
  
You like Alice Cooper  
You like Ringo Starr  
You like David Bowie  
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall  
Stick up the pictures, movies, TV  
And I'll bring you the show little girl  
Come to see me today  
  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart
