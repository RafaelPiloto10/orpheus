Don't play  
Don't play with my heart  
  
You can stop my heart  
Love is here and now you're gone  
Oh please, don't tear apart  
Baby, I am so alone  
We're looking on the same stars  
And on the same moon  
What have I done to you, lady  
Oh, wherever you are, please come back soon  
Can't you see I'm waiting for you  
  
Oh, don't play with my heart  
Don't do that again  
If you tear it apart, I cannot be your friend  
Don't play with my heart  
Again and again  
If you tear it apart  
How this love will end  
  
Don't play (playing tricks with my heart) don't play (playing tricks with my
heart) don't play (playing tricks with my heart) don't play (playing tricks
with my heart)  
Oh, you know it's true  
I gave you every single day  
Now, it's up to you  
Baby, please don't go away  
  
Oh, we'll find paradise  
And we'll loose it all  
What have I done to you, lady  
Don't tell me no lies  
Just give me a call  
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
