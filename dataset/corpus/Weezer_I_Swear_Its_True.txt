It's been two and a half years now that we've been apart  
I've kind of spaced out lately  
Can't seem to get you out of my mind  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
You think I'd have given up  
Found somebody new  
But that girls got what you've got, I belong to you  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh(2x)  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
I swear it's true(2x) I really do I swear it's true..
