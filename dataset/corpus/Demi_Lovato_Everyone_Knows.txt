Everyone says they know who I am  
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out  
But they only see me when I'm not afraid  
They only see who I wanna be  
  
We all run and hide every once and a while  
We all let go and run never letting it show  
  
Everyone says they know who I am  
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out  
But they only see me when I'm not afraid  
They only see who I wanna be  
  
They think they found their homecoming queen  
But baby  
Ohh  
But baby I'm just me  
  
We all run and hide every once and a while  
And we all let go and run never letting it show  
  
So look at me right now  
Take a good look  
Cus I'm not scared to frown  
No oh  
This is who I am  
Ill never change a thing not for you  
I'm just me
