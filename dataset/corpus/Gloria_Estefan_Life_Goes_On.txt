(After Love Is Gone)  
  
? Saying what's on your mind  
Don't hold back think if it would be kind  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
Don't bother now with apologise  
No tear full of?, no sad memories  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
I never knew you although I tried  
You always kept your feelings inside  
All I needed was someone to confide,  
Someone to be always by my side  
  
No painful sins, no? Guys  
No world full of excuses, no planed alibies  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
I never knew you although I tried  
You always kept your feelings inside  
All I needed was someone to confide,  
Someone to be always by my side  
No? ? To?  
When love is alive it's not worth the while  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)
