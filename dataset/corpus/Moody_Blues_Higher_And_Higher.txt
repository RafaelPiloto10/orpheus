Blasting, billowing, bursting forth  
With the power of ten billion butterfly sneezes  
Man with his flaming pyre  
Has conquered the wayward breezes  
  
Climbing to tranquility  
Far above the cloud  
Conceiving the heavens  
Clear of misty shroud  
  
Higher and higher  
Now we've learned to play with fire  
Go higher and higher and higher  
  
Vast vision must improve our sight  
Perhaps at last we'll see and end  
To our homes endless blight  
And the beginning of the free  
  
Climb to tranquility  
Finding its real worth  
Conceiving the heavens  
Florishing on earth  
  
Higher and higher  
Now we've learned to play with fire  
Go higher and higher and higher
