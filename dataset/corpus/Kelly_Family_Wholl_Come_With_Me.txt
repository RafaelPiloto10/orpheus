Who'll come with me, don't be afraid I know the way.  
Who'll sing with me, don't be afraid i'll show the way.  
Who'll dance with me, all through the world, don't be afraid I know the way.  
We'll come with you to search the way to find the star.  
Who'll come with us, don't be afraid we found the way.  
Who'll come with me to reach my star don't be afraid i'll show the way.  
Who'll be my friend and walk with me and sing this song.  
Who'll love will be we'll change the world and set it free.  
We'll walk with you.  
We'll be your friend.  
We'll sing your song.  
We know the way
