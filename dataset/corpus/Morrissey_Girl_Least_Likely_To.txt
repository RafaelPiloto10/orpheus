How many times have I been around?  
Recycled papers paving the ground  
Well, she lives for the written word  
And people come second, or possibly third  
  
And there is no style, but I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh, deep in my heart, how I wish I was wrong  
But deep in my heart, I know I am not  
And there's enough gloom in her world, I'm certain  
Without my contribution  
  
So I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Page after page of sniping rage  
An English singe or an American tinge  
"There's a publisher," she said, "...in the new year"  
(It's never in this year)  
  
I do think this, but I can't admit it  
To the girl least likely to  
So one more song with no technique  
One more song which seems all wrong...  
And oh, the news is bad again  
See me as I am again  
  
And the scales of justice sway one way  
In the rooms of those least likely to  
Oh, deep in my heart, how I want to be wrong  
But the moods and the styles too frequently change  
From twenty one to twenty five, from twenty five to twenty nine  
  
And I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh, one more song about The Queen  
Or standing around the shops with thieves  
"But somebody's got to make it!" she screams  
"So why why can't it be me?"  
But she would die if we heard her sing from the heart  
Which is hurt  
  
So how many times will I shed a tear?  
And another stage of verse to cheer  
When you shine in the public eye, my dear  
Please remember these nights  
When I sit and support with a dutiful smile  
Because there's nothing I can say  
So chucking, churning, and turning the knife  
On everything (except their own life)  
And a clock somewhere strikes midnight  
And an explanation - it drains me  
If only there could be a way  
  
There is a different mood all over the world  
A different youth, unfamiliar views  
And dearest, it could all be for you  
So will you come down and I'll meet you?  
And with no more poems, with nothing to hear  
Oh darling, it's all for you...  
Darling, it's all for you...  
Oh darling, it's all for you...  
Oh darling, it's all for you...
