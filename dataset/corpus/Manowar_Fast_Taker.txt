Mama is having problems  
always comes to me  
Your daddy's been a drinker since 1943  
They tell you I'm a loser  
'Cause I like bein free  
But truth is in the mirror  
It's what they never see  
  
I sing Yeah  
Long time ago  
You tried to tell me, son  
keep our daughter home  
I said no no, no no  
  
Now, I don't mind them saying  
That you should be praying  
For me, fast taker  
Right here's where I'm staying  
Life's a game I play  
For keeps, fast taker, bed breaker, love maker  
Take it away  
  
Only sixteen  
a woman not a girl  
Old enough  
For a trip around the world  
Pick you up on Friday  
When daddy goes to sleep  
Bring you back on Sunday  
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.  
  
Oh yeah, he won't see me  
  
Now do it right with music  
Then you learn how to use it  
All night, fast taker  
Right here's where I'm staying  
Life's a game I play  
For keeps, fast taker, bed breaker, love maker  
Take it away
