One, two, three...  
  
Tell me I'm mistaken  
I must be kinda slow  
But the only time you ever cared  
Was when you needed more ... easy money, easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
  
If you see a sucker standing at your door  
Bring him in and make him grin  
Then take him to the store  
Easy money, easy money  
Watch out from above  
You broke into the bank of love  
Easy money  
  
Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough  
Easy money, easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
I've come to the conclusion it's like the old man said  
The only thing you gave me was shit and promises  
Easy money, whoa whoa whoa, easy money  
One day you'll have to earn all the money that you burn  
Easy money  
  
Take it, Jeff ....  
  
Easy money  
  
Wha, wha, yeah  
  
Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough  
Easy money, easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
Funny thing about it  
Don't even make me blue  
'Cause there's no better deal around  
Than saying goodbye to you  
Easy money, easy money  
  
You snatched that cash right into your stash, easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
Easy money, woo woo woo, easy money
