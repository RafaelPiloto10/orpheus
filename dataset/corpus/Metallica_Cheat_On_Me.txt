Why do you cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on thee  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
  
I have a passionate heart  
It can tear us apart  
I have the loves of many men  
But I don't love any of them  
  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on thee  
Why do I cheat on me why  
Why do I cheat on me  
  
Why do I cheat on me  
  
You have your feelings  
I have mine  
I spit upon you and change my mind  
I have many hearts to break  
And many, many, many more to take  
  
Let the light of stars pour out  
Like a candle in a spout  
Let the wick recede and break  
Let the starlight radiate  
  
Why do you cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on thee  
Why do I desecrate me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I piss my dreams  
That's because that's what it is  
I have the drive  
I got the scope  
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope  
  
Your love means zero to me  
I'm a passionateless wave upon the sea  
Passionateless wave upon the sea  
Why, why, why  
Do you cheat on me  
Why, why, why  
Why do I cheat on me  
Oh why, do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on myself  
Well I got nobody else  
  
Why do you cheat on me  
Why do I cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on myself  
Well, well, well I really have nobody else  
Why do you cheat  
Why do you cheat on me  
Why do you cheat  
Why do you cheat on me  
  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on myself  
Well I got nobody else  
  
Why do I cheat on me  
Why do you cheat on me  
Your love means zero to me  
A passionateless wave  
Your love means zero to me
