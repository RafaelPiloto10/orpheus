Old toy trains  
Little toy tracks  
Little toy drums  
Coming from a sack  
Carried by a man  
Dressed  
In white and red  
Little one  
Don't you think  
It's time  
You were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen  
To the skies  
All is calm  
All is well  
Soon you'll hear  
Kris Kringle  
And his  
Jingle bells  
  
Bringing  
Old toy trains  
Little toy tracks  
Little toy drums  
Coming from a sack  
Carried by a man  
Dressed  
In white and red  
Little one  
Don't you think  
It's time  
You were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen  
To the skies  
All is calm  
All is well  
Soon you'll hear  
Kris Kringle  
And his  
Jingle bells  
  
Bringing  
Old toy trains  
Little toy tracks  
Little toy drums  
Coming from a sack  
Carried by a man  
Dressed  
In white and red  
Little one  
Don't you think  
It's time  
You were in bed?
