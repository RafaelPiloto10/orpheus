Hey Baby, Is that you?  
Wow your hair got so long.  
Yea, yea! I love it, I really do.  
  
Norma Jean ain't that the song  
We'd sing in the car  
Drivin' down town,  
Top down makin' the rounds,  
Checkin' out the bands on Dull Hinney Avenue.  
  
Yea life throws you curves,  
But you learned to swerve.  
Me I swung and I miss  
And the next thing you know I'm reminiscing.  
Dreaming old dreams,  
Wishing old wishes,  
Like we would be back again.  
  
[Chorus]  
I wake up and tear drops,  
They fall down like rain.  
I put on that old song we danced to and then,  
I head off to my job,  
Guess not much has changed.  
Punch the clock.  
Head for home.  
Check the phone,  
Just in case.  
Go to bed,  
Dream of you,  
That's what I'm doing these days.  
  
Yea that's what I'm doing.  
  
Someone told me, after college,  
You ran off to Vegas,  
You married a rodeo cowboy...why  
That ain't the girl I knew.  
  
Me I've been a few places,  
Mostly here and there once or twice.  
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright.  
Yea, It's good to see you too.  
  
Well hey girl, you're late.  
And those planes they don't wait.  
But if you ever come back around  
This sleepy old town,  
Promise me you'll stop in  
To see an old friend,  
And until then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
I wake up and tear drops,  
They fall down like rain.  
I put on that old song we danced to and then,
