This is New York, yo  
(It's getting dark)  
  
Night falls on the city  
Finds me all alone  
Makes me wonder  
Should I just go on home  
  
And I walk up the stairs  
To see if you're sill there  
Would you mind if  
I found you alone  
  
Then a cold wind came callin'  
Strange how it knew it'd bother me  
See the night would fade  
But the pain's gonna stay  
Makes me wonder  
Have you ever made love to me  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Ain't it sad  
When the only love I ever had  
Just slips away  
Right through my fingers  
  
Ain't it a shame when I think of your name  
The only memory I have is it  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Can't stop it, blinds my eyes
