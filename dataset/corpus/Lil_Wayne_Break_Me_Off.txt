[Lil Wayne]  
We have them bitches like it was unplugged  
Its Weezy wee, Mannie fresh, and unplugged  
We have them bitches like it was unplugged  
Weezy, fresh, and unplugged  
  
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]  
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress  
One put them lips in effect  
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest  
You can piss on her breast  
I like that shit  
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick  
Give me a spanish sweet hoe  
Black from Puerto Rico  
Freak ho, specialize in givin' me deep throat  
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick  
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum don't spit  
Aww shit, I like them Jamaicans and them Haitians  
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em  
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it  
They love it when everybody saw it  
Its off the chain  
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain  
But watch them hoes who want the change  
Its not a game  
Or short Cuban hoe, with a fat ass though  
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro  
  
[Chorus: Unplugged]  
Tell me what you like  
Let me tell you what I like  
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night  
You can ride with me  
Cause I like ya simmon's jeans  
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene  
Truly I just want you to break me off  
  
[Verse 2: Lil wanye]  
Weezy the hottest  
Drinkin' barcadi  
I stream through the scene on a lincon on robbers  
Lookin' for the finest dime, to wine and dine  
Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine  
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down  
Pick it up, throw ya ass down  
Now throw ya ass around  
An scream me name  
I can't hear you say it louder what (wayne, wayne)  
A damn shame  
Better watch that boy he nasty  
I strap on a plastic  
Break ya off like elastic  
Put the dick in the middle, make it wiggle for ya'll  
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all  
I like a short thick broad, fat ass an shit  
Like taso flip like Trina the baddest bitch  
Matter of fact when I see her, pull her over like a cop  
Juve could of backed it up an I would of dropped it like its hot  
Ha ha, ya heard me  
Ha ha, unplugged  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]  
I like them big, round, yellow and brown  
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (ugh ugh) sound  
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up  
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut  
Bounce for ya hood, shake for ya baby daddy  
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the caddy  
Slide with the ky, hold up ?  
My bitch got thong, you bitch got drawls  
My chick like to swallow, yo chick like to spit  
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch  
Hold up, chill out, wait a minute stop  
My ginseng, Viagra, and a strawberry pop  
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, why don't ya bring a friend  
From vagina to the asshole do it again  
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever  
Yo mama loved a tymer, now you welcome  
You OK lil mama and I love that chick  
But deep down inside I just love me dick  
  
[Chorus: x4]
