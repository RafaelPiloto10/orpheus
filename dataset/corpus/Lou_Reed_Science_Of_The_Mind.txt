In the science of the mind  
There is no forgiving  
Paralyzed I lay here sleeping  
Quiet as a little child  
Heart starts beating  
Blood rushing pounding  
Moving quiet as a little lamb  
  
In the science of the mind  
Limbs are bound devoid of movement  
The injuries we do in kind  
Are visited upon us often  
  
In the science of the mind  
Trying hard to move a shadow  
Don't bury me I'm still alive  
The science of the mind unyielding  
The science of the mind unyielding  
The science of the mind unyielding
