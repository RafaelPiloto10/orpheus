All eyes on this like sunrise waiting on the day we brave  
Don't you want them all to remember our names?  
Talk about a love and the trails we place  
Cuz the only thing that the world can't change  
Is you and I  
Something in your eyes, something in your eyes  
Telling me we're running out of time, running out of time,  
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight  
Can you just stay with me?  
Light it up the sky, light it up the sky  
Promise you that we can burn so bright, we can burn so bright  
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight  
We can make history  
Why wait, don't need to hear ok  
when we can make mistake, our way  
  
Don't you want them all to remember our names?  
Talk about a love and the trails we place  
Cuz the only thing that the world can't change  
Is you and I  
Something in your eyes, something in your eyes  
Telling me we're running out of time, running out of time,  
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight  
Can you just stay with me?  
Light it up the sky, light it up the sky  
Promise you that we can burn so bright, we can burn so bright  
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight  
We can make history  
  
We don't need anything or anyone  
We can rise higher than the sun  
The only thing we'll ever need is you and me  
So baby just stay with me  
  
We don't need anything or anyone  
We can rise higher than the sun  
The only thing we'll ever need is you and me  
We can make history
