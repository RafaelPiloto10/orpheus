You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
Hey, it's me again  
Plain to see again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
I'm a fool again  
I fell in love with you again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
Words don't come out right  
I try to say it oh so right  
I hope you understand my meaning  
  
Hey, it's me again  
I'm so in love with you again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
I remember every word you said  
(Word you said)  
I remember voices in my head  
(In my head)  
I remember ever word you said  
(Word you said)  
  
I heard your voice-it  
Your voice is-cool voices  
Warm voices  
Just what I needed, too  
Words don't seem right  
But its  
Cool voices-warm voices  
Your voice is  
Just what I needed for  
Love is the word-it's  
Warm voices-your voice is  
Cool voices  
Just what I needed, too  
I heard your voice-it was  
Your voice is-cool voices  
Warm voices  
  
Just what I needed, too  
Just what I needed, too  
Just what I needed, too
