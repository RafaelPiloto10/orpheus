Oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh,I love ya X2  
I do,I do,  
Oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh,I love ya X2  
I do,I do.  
  
I told you why we just can't make it,  
I want you still but I just can't take it,  
The time has come we ought to break it,  
Someone had to pay the price.  
  
Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh,it's over x2  
It's true,it's true,  
Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh,it's over x2  
It's true, It's true.  
  
I think of times we were together,  
As time went on it seemed forever,  
Times have changed now things are better,  
Someone had to pay the price.  
  
And I think of times we were together,
