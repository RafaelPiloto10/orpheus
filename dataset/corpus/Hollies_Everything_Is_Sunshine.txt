I keep on thinkin about the things that make me cry  
I keep on thinkin about the things that make me die  
but everythin is sunshine when you hold my hand  
  
If everybody knew you the way I do  
people wouldn't wear frowns the way they do  
Cause everything is sunshine when you hold my hand  
  
Oh no how could it be  
You effect me  
Just by holding my hand  
By holding my hand  
  
(repeat)  
[Verse 2]  
If everybody knew you the way I do  
people wouldn't wear frowns the way they do  
Cause everything is sunshine  
Everything is sunshine  
Everything is sunshine
