Jerry was a race car driver  
And he drove so goddamn fast  
He never did win no checkered flag  
But he never did come in last  
Jerry was a race car driver  
He'd say el solo number one  
With a Bocephus sticker  
On his 442 he'd light 'em up  
Just for fun  
  
Captain Pierce was a fireman  
Richmond engine number three  
I'll be a wealthy man when I get  
A dime for all the things that  
Man taught to me  
Captain pierce was a strong man  
Strong as any man alive  
It stuck in his craw that they  
Made him retire at the age of 65  
  
Jerry was a race car driver  
22 years old  
Had one too many cold beers one night  
And wrapped himself around a telephone pole.
