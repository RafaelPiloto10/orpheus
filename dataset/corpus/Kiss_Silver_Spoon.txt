I ain't lookin' like nobody's fool, save it for somebody else  
And I ain't makin' any desperate move, 'till I'm satisfied myself  
I ain't waitin' for no invitation, I just want to walk on through  
I never needed anybody, and like my daddy said  
  
I wasn't born with a silver spoon, nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude that's in your eyes, I got no reason to apologize  
Cause what's so special 'bout a girl like you, with a silver spoon  
  
In a city where the buildings rise, I was just another face  
But mama told me when somebody dies, no one else can take your place  
I never needed anybody, and like my daddy said  
  
I wasn't born with a silver spoon, nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude that's in your eyes, I got no reason to apologize  
Cause I've got something for a girl like you, with a silver spoon  
  
I always knew I'd be somebody, I kept it in my head  
I never needed anybody, and like my daddy said  
  
I wasn't born with a silver spoon, nowhere to hide in a crowded room  
I see the attitude that's in your eyes, I got no reason to apologize  
Cause what's so special 'bout a girl like you, with a silver spoon
