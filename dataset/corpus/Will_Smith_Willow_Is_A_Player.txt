[Chorus]  
Willow is a player  
She's got me going crazy (crazy)  
She's got me wrapped around her finger  
She's got me going out of my mind (playing all the time)  
Willow is a player  
She's got me going crazy (crazy)  
She's got me wrapped around her finger  
She's got me going out of my mind (playing all the time)  
  
Every time I see her can't help but to smile (smile smile)  
And every time I touch her (touch her) she make me feel like a child (feel
like a child)  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked, locked up  
I do just about anything (anything) to stay on her good side  
And when she want something (something) from me she won't be denied  
Can't even go shopping (shopping) without buying her a gift  
Every eye tied to her as she steps out the crib (steps out the crib)  
She keeps me up all night (night) on my knees as I pray (pray)  
Cause I can't sleep till (sleep till) I know she's okay  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked - locked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I saw another man hold her  
Just a friendly hello  
I know it was nothing (nothing) but he took to long to let go  
(I think you better let her go)  
Let my girl (girl), girl (girl) go (go)  
I try to be tough though (so strong)  
Sometimes she makes me so mad (so mad)  
Her eyes like diamonds (diamonds) make me forget she's so bad (she's so bad)  
She's my angel (angel)  
This world she's not of  
Sent from the upstairs (upstairs)  
Taught me that new kind of love (love love love)  
I can't tell why yall (don't understand) what she means in my life (the world
to me)  
What make it so crazy (crazy), I met her through my wife  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked, locked up  
  
[Chorus]
