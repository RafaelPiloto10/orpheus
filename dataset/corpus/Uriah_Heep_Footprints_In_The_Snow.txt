Just like footprints in the snow  
Who knows where my heart will go  
Will it lead me to you  
Or will I see another empty day  
  
Seasons come and quickly go  
Kinda makes me  
Wonder if they know  
Why my heart keeps  
Running near and far  
If only they could tell me  
Where you are  
  
If you've ever been in love  
Then you'll know the rocky road  
I've been speaking of  
You'll remember when  
The times were good  
And the times  
You had to do without  
Think carefully my friend  
It may look like a start  
But it could be the end  
  
I'm not trying to bring you down  
I'm just so tired of hangin' around  
I won't make  
The same mistake again
