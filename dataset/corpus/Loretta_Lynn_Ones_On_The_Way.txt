They say to have her hair done, Liz flies all the way to France  
And Jackie's seen in a Discotecque doin' a brand new dance  
And the White House social season should be glitterin' an' gay  
  
But here in Topeka the rain is a fallin'  
The faucet is a drippin' and the kids are a-bawlin'  
One of 'em a toddlin' and one is a crawlin'  
And one's on the way  
  
I'm glad Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact  
And Debbie's out in Vegas workin' up a brand new act  
While the TV's showin' newlyweds, a real fun game to play  
  
But here in Topeka, the screen door's a bangin'  
The coffee's boilin' over and the wash needs a hangin'  
One wants a cookie and one wants a changin'  
And one's on the way  
  
Now what was I doin'? Jimmy get away from there  
Darn, there goes the phone  
Hello honey, what's that you say?  
You're bringin' a few old army buddies home?  
You're callin' from a bar?  
Get away from there! No, not you honey  
I was talkin' to the baby  
Wait a minute, honey, the door bell  
Honey, could you stop at the market and hello?, hello?  
Well, I'll be  
  
The girls in New York City, they all march for women's lib  
And better homes and garden shows, the modern way to live  
And the pill may change the world tomorrow, but meanwhile, today  
  
Here in Topeka, the flies are a buzzin'  
The dog is a barkin' and the floor needs a scrubbin'  
One needs a spankin' and one needs a huggin'  
Lord, one's on the way  
  
Oh gee, I hope it ain't twins, again!
