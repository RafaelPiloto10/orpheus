Kids if you want some fun  
Mr. LaPage is your man  
He's always laughing, having fun  
Showing his films in the den  
Come on, come on  
Soon you will be eighteen  
I think you know what I mean  
Don't tell your mama  
Your daddy or mama  
They'll never know where you been  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone's gone to the movies  
Now we're alone at last  
  
Listen to what I say  
He wants to show you the way  
Right down the hallway with open arms  
To teach you a new game to play  
Come on, come on  
Soon it will be too late  
Bobbing for apples can wait  
We know you're used to sixteen or more  
Sorry we only have eight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kids if you want some fun  
See what you never have seen  
Take off your cheaters and sit right down  
Start the projection machine  
  
[Chorus]
