Oh, me name is MacNamara, I'm the leader of the band  
Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land  
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball  
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair  
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand  
Says he, "I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band"  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come  
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum  
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand  
They shout, "There's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band!"  
  
Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green  
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen  
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland  
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
That's MacNamara
