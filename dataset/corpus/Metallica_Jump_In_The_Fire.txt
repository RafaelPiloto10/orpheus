Down in the depths of my fiery home  
The summons bell will chime  
Tempting you and all the earth  
To join our sinful kind  
There is a job to be done and I'm the one  
You people make me do it  
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate  
To pull you down into this pit  
  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
  
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins  
The end is closing in  
Feeding on the minds of man  
And from their souls within  
My disciples all shout to search out  
And they always shall obey  
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild  
But do just as I say  
  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
  
Jump by your will or be taken by force  
I'll get you either way  
Trying to keep the hellfire lit  
I am stalking you as prey  
Living your life as me I am you you see  
There is part of me in everyone  
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land  
Come home where you belong  
  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire
