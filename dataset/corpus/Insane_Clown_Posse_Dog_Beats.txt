When we let the bass drop  
Inner Citty Posse's got the bad rep  
Like my man on the cruches took a big step  
And I can't stand the neighborhood menace  
So I swell his chin like Rocky Denice  
Bass in the car somethin stacks

Everyone's brittle when the bass rocks  
So I got a little somethin in the glovebox  
Long black hair with the white rag  
40 cent Faygo in a brown bag  
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, and Nate The Mack  
Chillen by my side 'cause my Posse's stacked

Waiten at the light as my bass thumps  
And I'm gettin jocked by these local chumps  
They point, they wave, they stare, they look

Violent J down with the pimp daddy's (3x)  
Smooth plushc rides in the velvet caddy's  
All the way live down Jefferson
