You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night  
You see how it was my fault. Of course it was mine.  
I'm too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your
life.  
I'm sorry for wasting your time.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my job to make the most of it  
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.  
  
Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything that's great  
But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away?  
So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make
it  
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my time to make the most of
it  
How could I ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no  
All along the fault is up for grabs why don't you have it  
Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I
bought it for  
Pay no more than absolutely zero.  
  
Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away  
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game that's made for two that's
you and me  
The rules remain a mystery. See it can be easy.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's our time to make the most of
it  
How could we ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no  
All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it  
Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I
bought it for  
Pay no more than absolutely zero.
