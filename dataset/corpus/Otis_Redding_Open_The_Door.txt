I've been so wrong, so many times. Now you know what  
I'm talking about. We've all been wrong a time in our life  
And we all make mistakes sometimes of leaving what's good for us  
I made that mistake, now I'm trying to get back to my baby  
  
This running round, sure 'nough, is killing me  
Let me, let me in  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in  
  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see I got to come on in  
I ain't lying, and I ain't smiling 'bout it, baby  
Open the door or I'm busting in  
Because this running around  
Sure 'nough, sure 'nough, is killing me  
  
Let me in, it's killing me, baby  
I got a come on in  
Let me in, baby, please let me in  
  
I got a come on in, honey  
Open the door  
Open the door  
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in  
Mama, mama, got to come in  
Open the door  
I can't stand this cold  
Let me in this house  
I'm tired of this running around  
Tired of being, tired of being all alone  
Standing out here and walking with, walking with
