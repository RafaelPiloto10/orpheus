I was born by the river, just like this river,  
I've been moving ever since  
Ain't got no body to call my own you know  
I've been moving since the day I was born  
Life is a game just made for fun, I don't need no body  
No, I don't love no one  
Yes, I'm a mover baby  
Now get out of my way will ya?  
Don't try to stop me now  
  
Following the footpath one fine day,  
When I asked a wise man which was the way,  
He said "follow you heart and look for yourself,  
And come back and tell me what you have learned".  
Yes, I'm a mover.  
  
Went back and told him I'd found me a wife,  
Eleven children and a real good life,  
Told him I'd left this happy home,  
Cause I need to return to the long winding road  
Yes, I'm a mover.
