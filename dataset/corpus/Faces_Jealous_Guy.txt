(john lennon)  
  
I was dreaming of the past  
And my heart was beating fast  
I began to lose control  
I began to lose control  
I didn't want to hurt you  
And I'm sorry I made you cry, no  
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care  
I'm just a jealous guy  
I was feeling insecure  
You might not need me anymore  
I was shivering inside  
I was shivering inside  
I didn't want to hurt you  
And I'm sorry I made you cry, oww  
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care  
I'm just a jealous guy
