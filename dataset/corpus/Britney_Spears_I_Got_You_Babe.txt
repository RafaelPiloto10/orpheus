(with Frank Skinner)  
  
BRITNEY (FRANK)  
They say we're young and we don't know  
Won't find out until we grow  
(Well I don't know why that is true)  
(Cuz you got me and baby, I got you)  
  
CHORUS:  
Babe  
I got you, babe  
I got you, babe  
  
(I got flowers, in the spring)  
(I got you, you wear my ring)  
When I'm sad, you're a clown  
And I get scared, you're always around  
  
When they say your hair's too long  
But I don't care, with you I can't go wrong  
(Then put your little hand in mine)  
(There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb)  
  
CHORUS  
  
(I got you to hold my hand)  
I got you to understand  
(I got you to walk with me)  
And I got you to talk to me, yeah  
(I got you to kiss goodnight)  
And I got you to hold me tight  
(I got you and I won't let go)  
And I got you who loves me so, yeah  
  
I got you, babe
