I lost the signal and put you away  
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day  
Loosen the noose and let go of the rope  
I know if it's never coming back it has to go  
  
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never I wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
I found the weakness and put it to play  
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you til the night was day  
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know  
You said if you're never comin' back you have to go  
  
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Oh my goodness, here I go again  
Pullin' you back to me, pullin' you back into my arms so selfishly  
I don't think I understand 'cause I don't really know myself  
I keep callin' you callin' you out  
Callin' you out, callin' you out, callin' you out  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Ah, ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Ah, ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms
