Go to the city away from the land, stand in a line  
Where they stamp your hand, wind up at a dance  
You want to energize, is it just by chance?  
People have electric eyes  
Wires and strings, line that lead to power supplies  
Games read green on table screens, charged and powered  
Mediaized, we are channeled, we are hypnotized  
Wake up, shake up the situation  
Hold on, help the situation  
Human condition, so extreme  
You can see it feeding the new machine  
There is still a dream, our humanity, hero rebels die  
Leaving us the key  
Wake up, shake up the situation  
Hold on, help the situation
