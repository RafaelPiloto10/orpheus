I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
I had a job and I lost it  
But it won't get to me  
  
'Cause I'm ridin' with my baby  
And it's a brand new day  
We're on the wheels of an angel  
Flyin' away  
  
[Chorus]  
And the sun is shinin'  
This road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
Now she's strummin' on my six-string  
Across her pretty knees  
She's stompin' out a rhythm  
And singin' to me the sweetest song  
  
The sun is shinin'  
This road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin'  
And this road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
We're on the wheels of an angel  
And I'm free  
She's strummin' on my six-string  
It's across her pretty knees  
She's stompin' out a rhythm  
And singin' to me
