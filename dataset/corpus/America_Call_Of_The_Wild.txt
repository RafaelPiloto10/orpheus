Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
Nights are forever  
The days linger on  
Standing in silence  
Time lasts so long  
Through all my efforts  
I act like a child  
Hearin' the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't know  
I'm wearin'  
Someone else's clothes  
I needed  
Singing like a child  
I hear the call of the wild  
Casting my mind back  
Some things don't seem right  
An image of angels  
Appears in the night  
As I awoke  
I could swear that they smiled  
Hearin' the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild  
Now, hear the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild
