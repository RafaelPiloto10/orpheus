Living and dying laughing and crying  
Once you have seen it you will never be the same  
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems  
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean  
  
Motorbreath  
Its how I live my life  
I can't take it any other way  
Motorbreath  
The sign of living fast  
It is going to take  
Your breath away  
  
Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing  
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way  
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line  
Sending the shivers up and down your spine  
  
Motorbreath  
Its how I live my life  
I can't take it any other way  
Motorbreath  
The sign of living fast  
It is going to take  
Your breath away  
  
Those people who tell you not to take chances  
They are all missing on what life is about  
You only live once so take hold of the chance  
Don't end up like others the same song and dance  
  
Motorbreath  
Its how I live my life  
I can't take it any other way  
Motorbreath  
The sign of living fast  
It is going to take  
Your breath away
