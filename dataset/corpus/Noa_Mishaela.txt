Who knows what is in her eyes?  
Grey clouds disperse in the four winds.  
A dry riverbed overflows.  
And the horizon opens wide.  
  
Up to the heaven she turns her eyes.  
Searching, diving in to the chilly blue.  
Floating in the air  
Touching the pure golden light  
That glimmers in her hair.  
  
Mishaela, what do you see?  
What is it in your heart  
That greets the desolate silence with such laughter?  
  
It is one rainbow in the east, she says.  
It is all I need.  
  
What more could I want?  
It is all that I need.
