I keep hangin' on the promise of love  
Your eyes tell me that I'm gonna see  
I feel the hunger like a starving man  
Honey, when you stand close to me  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I'm in the mood for action  
In need of satisfaction,  
Babe, I'm gonna make you mine  
  
Now I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I've got the weakness of an ordinary man  
I need the comfort of womanly mind,  
But, I get nervous when I think about  
So many women an' so little time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I get so nervous when I think about  
So many women an' not enough time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I'm hungry for love
