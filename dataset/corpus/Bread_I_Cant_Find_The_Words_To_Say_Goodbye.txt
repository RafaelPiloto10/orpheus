Can't say I don't love her  
Still I can't pretend  
That my heart is torn just knowing that I'm losing my bestfriend  
If it's easier said and done  
Then someone tell me why  
Though I try,  
I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
I could tell her that I'm sorry  
Hope she'll understand  
She will have to do with someone else  
All that we have planned  
I'd rather her hear the truth  
Than hurt her with a lie  
So I tried,  
But I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
Now I know  
I have to go  
There's no other way  
But goodbye is not what I can bring myself to say...  
  
If I told her "see you later"  
Then I might be wrong  
'cause this voice inside is driving me  
To find where I belong  
I know I must leave her now but everytime I try,  
Don't know why,  
Ibut I can't find the words to say goodbye...  
Don't know why,  
I can't find the words to say goodbye....
