I'm her only man  
And she's my only romance  
I'm her only man  
And she's my only romance  
  
Singing oh, oh, oh  
I'm a happy man  
Singing oh, oh, oh  
  
I can make her scream  
'Cause she's my only machine  
I'm her confidant  
And she's my only cream  
  
Singing oh, oh, oh  
I'm a happy man  
oh, oh, oh  
I am happy man  
  
A happy man  
A happy man  
A happy man  
Yes I am  
  
I'm her only love  
And she fits me like a glove  
I'm her only blood  
We do it down in the mud  
  
Because we are lovers  
And she's my girl  
  
I'm singing oh, oh  
I'm in a happy world
