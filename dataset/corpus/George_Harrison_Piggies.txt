Have you see the little piggies  
Crawling in the dirt?  
And for all the little piggies  
Life is getting worse  
Always having dirt  
To play around in  
Have you see the bigger piggies  
In their starched white shirts?  
You will find the bigger piggies  
Stirring up the dirt  
Always have clean shirts  
To play around in  
In their sties with all their backing  
They don't care what goes on around  
In their eyes there's something lacking  
What they need's a darn good whacking  
Everywhere there's lots of piggies  
Living piggy lives  
You can see them out for dinner  
With their piggy wives  
Clutching forks and knives  
To eat their bacon  
One more time
