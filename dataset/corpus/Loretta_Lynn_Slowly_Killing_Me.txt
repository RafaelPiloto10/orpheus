Oh I can't live without you and I'm barely living with you  
I can't get her off your mind and I can't set you free  
When you look at one another your look tells me you love her  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
Oh what's this other woman done to you  
She can't ever love you like I do  
Cry tears enough to drown me heartache's closing in around me  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
[ steel ]  
Oh what's this other woman done to you  
Why she can't ever love you like I do  
I'd die the night you leave me I cry but you don't see me  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
Yes that's the part that slowly killing me
