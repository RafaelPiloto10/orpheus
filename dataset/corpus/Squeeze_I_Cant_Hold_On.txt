In the corner by the D.J. unit  
The flag of beauty my eyes salute it,  
She likes love  
By luck or labour  
She likes love  
But not for favour - can't hold on  
She keeps her lips on the straw she's sucking  
Looks up to me but her eyes see nothing,  
Love's her stare  
The steps to her heart  
Love's the climb  
The bite not her bark.  
I pour the milk into the cat's saucer  
I'm John Wayne as I'm walking towards her,  
She'd like to dance  
But not this minute  
She's the fish I'd love to fillet.  
I draw first with a stammer of verbal  
We dance like pigeons forever in circle,  
She likes to dance  
Her cocktails shaken  
She likes love  
And it's temptation  
  
The lights flash green  
My envy lights up  
The lights just flash  
And I feel tied up,  
Love's for sale  
And I am sold on  
But there's no way  
That I can hold on  
I can't hold on
