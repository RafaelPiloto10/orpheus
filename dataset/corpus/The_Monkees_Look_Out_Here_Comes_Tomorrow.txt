Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
That's when I'll have to choose.  
How I wish I could borrow,  
Someone else's shoes.  
  
Mary, oh what a sweet girl,  
Lips like strawberry pie.  
Sandra, the long hair and pig tails,  
Can't make up my mind.  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them,  
Said it, and it was true.  
But I can't have both of them  
Don't know what to do.  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come
