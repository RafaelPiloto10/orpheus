In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
  
In your letter you said you didn't love me  
You said you're gonna leave me  
But you could've said it better  
Oh in your letter, you said you couldn't face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you could've said it better  
  
You could've left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You could've told him something  
And proved to me you don't love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
You could've left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You could've told him something  
And proved to me you don't love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
In your letter you said you didn't love me  
You said you're gonna leave me  
But you could've said it better  
Oh in your letter, you said you couldn't face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you could've said it better
