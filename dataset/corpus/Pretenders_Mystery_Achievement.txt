Mystery achievement  
Don't breathe down my neck no  
I got no trophies on display  
I sign them away  
I mean what the heck  
All of your promises  
Don't fill me with pride no  
I just wanna get out on the floor  
And do the Cuban slide, slide, slide, slide  
  
But every day, every nighttime I find  
Mystery achievement  
You're on my mind  
And every day, every nighttime I feel  
Mystery achievement you're so unreal  
  
Mystery achievement  
Where's my sandy beach? Yeah  
I had my dreams like everybody else  
But they're out of reach  
I said right out of reach  
I could ignore you  
Your demands are unending  
I got no tears on my ice cream but you know me  
I love pretending  
  
But every day, every nighttime I find  
Mystery achievement  
You're on my mind  
And every day, every nighttime I feel  
Mystery achievement you're so unreal
