[Chorus]  
It's a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride, dip and slipping  
Take your mind, on a high  
It's a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride, dip and slipping  
Take your mind, on a high  
  
Yo yo, from that DPG nigga to the CP3  
Back to the house, East to the West  
Now take it BACK to the South  
You know, how I switch my flow  
If I'm lapsing you glad niggas'll get mad then, hit the flo'  
Gotta bag me some dank so I, hit the sto'  
In the winter it's the Hummer for the summer it's the, six-fo'  
Got niggas mad at me (why?) Cause they can't get no six  
Bitches upset with me (why?) Cause they can't get no dick  
I'ma be on top of the game whether I'm, broke or rich  
I don't stop once I'm on top I just drop mo' hits  
I'm in the club with the thug, I just pop mo' Crist'  
Tell Snoop to get the Coupe his new shit I just, gots to go get  
Cause when I cock my shit, usually I pop my shit  
Tell all you teary eyed females gettin over-offended  
Cause I don't jock no chick  
I'm the Boss, and I don't follow no person, I follow Jesus  
Y'all blame a bunch of kids, so I gotta roll my Adidas  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boom bam as I step in the jam, god damn  
Don't need no introduction, cause you know who I am  
The S-N-double-O-P, the only, fo' sho'  
Now motherfuckers let me hear you say hoe  
I spit ya, spat at ya, whoot wham, get at ya  
Rider, I threw a slider, right at ya  
Mash ya, gat ya, drip-drop the hatchet  
Keep the party cracking, while I'm steady rapping  
This game we run, y'all know what's happening  
We back in effect, we got the heat on deck  
I'm sliding down South with a blunt in my mouth  
I catch a plane out East and try to make some peace  
I'm hanging with my niggas in the projects  
The homie's throwing a party, I gotta get back West  
Oh yeah, that's right, we are the best  
No Limit DPG Southwest connects, ya feel me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep it gangsta  
Keep it gangsta, keep it gangsta dogg  
Keep it, keep it gangsta dogg  
Yeah, we keep it gangsta dogg  
Fo' sho', we keep it gangsta dogg, what?  
Yeah, I wanna say what up to all them gangstas  
Out there on the Eastisde  
(on the Southside, on the Northside) Yeah  
(on the Westside)  
Y'all niggas need to point the guns in the right directions  
Ya know, ya heard?  
  
It's a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride, dip and slippin  
Take your mind, on a high  
It's a gangsta gangsta ride  
On the nutty danger side  
As we ride, dip and slippin  
Take your mind, on a high  
  
[Chorus: x2]
