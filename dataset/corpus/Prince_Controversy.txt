Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven  
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses  
As we forgive those who trespass against us  
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever
