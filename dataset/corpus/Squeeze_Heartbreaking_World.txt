The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a starving face on my TV screen  
The desperate face that I saw  
Had my disbelief hanging from my jaw  
Our harvest could be shared around  
Instead it's buried in the ground  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a football fan dying for his team  
The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
It's fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing I've ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound I've ever heard  
Was a baby's cry in this wicked world  
The innocence of that cry  
Leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
And you're the one that breaks it for me
