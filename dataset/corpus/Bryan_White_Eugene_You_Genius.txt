Saw you come through them swingin' doors  
Had 'em hangin' on ya  
Couldn't hold one more  
You walked by with a silly grin  
They were kissin' all over your chinny chin chin  
  
Eugene you genius  
What book did you read  
That made you so smart  
You could steal a heart  
Anytime that you please  
Eugene you genius  
Could you teach me  
  
It's more than the way you comb your hair  
That's makin' all the pretty girls stop and stare  
Tell me Eugene I just gotta know  
Can I go down and buy it at the grocery store  
  
Is it something that you tell 'em  
Love letters that you mail 'em  
Your secrets safe with me  
To get those of kind of glances  
Do you have to take classes  
For a master romeo degree
