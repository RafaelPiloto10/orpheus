As war drums beat in Babylon  
Cinnamon girl starts to pray  
I've never heard a prayer like this 1  
Never before that day  
  
Tearful words of love for people she had never met before  
Asking God to grant them mercy in this face of a holy war  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage  
Never knew the meaning of color lines  
Nine one one turned that all around  
When she got accused of this crime  
  
So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi  
What's the use when the god of confusion keeps on telling the same lie?  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
Don't cry, don't shed no tears  
1 night won't make us feel  
Cause we know how this movie's ending  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
As war drums beat in Babylon  
And scorch the blood red sky  
Militants bomb the foreign gun  
Both sides truly die  
  
Cinnamon girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores  
Then she prays after the war that there will not be anymore  
  
Cinnamon Girl
