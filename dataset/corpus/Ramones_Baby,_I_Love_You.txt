Have I ever told you  
How good it feels to hold you  
It isn't easy to explain  
  
And though I'm really tryin'  
I think I may start cryin'  
My heart can't wait an other day  
  
When you kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta say :  
  
Baby, I love you  
Come on baby  
Baby, I love you  
Baby I love, I love only you  
  
I can't live without you  
I love everything about you  
I can't help it if I feel this way  
  
Oh I'm so glad I found you  
I want my arms around you  
I love to hear you call my name  
  
Oh tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel the same  
  
Baby, I love you  
Come on baby  
Baby, I love you  
Baby I love, I love only you
