Put me on the table  
Make me say your name  
If I can't remember  
Then give me all your pain  
I can sit and listen  
Or I can make you scream  
Kiss it and make it better  
Just put your trust in me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh my God, go a little slower  
Oh my God, what was that again  
La da da, let me feel you baby  
Let me in, 'cause I understand  
Let me feel you baby  
'Cause I understand  
  
[Rap]  
I understand all  
Now climb my sugar walls  
Problem solved it's dissolved  
With the solvent known as spit  
Lickity lick not so quick it's a  
Slick ride make my mink slide  
'Cause were all pink inside  
  
This can be really easy  
It doesn't have to be hard  
Here baby let me show you  
I'll have ya, climbing up the walls  
You got all the problems  
I think that I can solve  
Why don't you come in here baby  
Why don't we sit and talk  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Rap]  
You like the top and the bottom  
You make a drop and then caught 'em  
And when you rock then you've got 'em  
Oh my God 'em oh my God 'em  
  
[Ad libs]
