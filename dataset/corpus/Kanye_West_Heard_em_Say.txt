(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah  
  
And I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way  
So this is in the name of love, like a rob would say  
Before you ask me to get a job today,  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars  
Things we seen on the screen are not ours  
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it  
  
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a
way  
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only
way)  
  
They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'  
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'  
And Jesus, one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'  
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'  
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us  
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down  
Now my 'lil cousin smokin' those cigarettes now  
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now  
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?  
I can't figure it out, I'm stickin' around  
  
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a
way  
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only
way)  
  
Cause every worthless word we got more far away,  
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe,  
It hurts but it may be the only way
