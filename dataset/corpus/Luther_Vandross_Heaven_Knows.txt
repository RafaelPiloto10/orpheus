Heaven knows I love you,  
heaven knows how much I care.  
Couldn't live without you,  
look for me and I'll be there.  
  
But even though you're a joy to me,  
I think you think, "He's a bore to me."  
What's your thing, am I still your guy?  
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die.  
  
You're the one on my mind,  
got me working over time.  
I only think about love and you.  
Talk to me, don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you.  
I try to love you.  
  
Used to be amazing,  
used to make the world say "Wow."  
Heaven brought us together,  
That's how I know it'll all work out.  
  
We built our love on solid ground,  
and can't a thing ever bring us down.  
Back together like we wanted to,  
I'm so confused, my darling, remembering you.  
  
You're still the one on my mind,  
love is working overtime.  
I only dream about love and you.  
Talk to me, don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you,  
I try to love you, yeah.  
  
You're the only one on my mind,  
got me working over time.  
I only think about love, don't you?  
Talk to me don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you.  
I try to love you, baby.  
This is love that you can't ignore,  
I never knew a girl like you before  
And heaven knows I couldn't love you more.  
  
This is so right, this is so right.  
This is so right because I love you,  
I really love you, baby.  
Back together like we wanted to  
forget me not 'cause I remember you.  
  
You're the one on my mind,  
got me working over time.  
I only think about love and you.  
Talk to me, don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you.  
I try to love you.  
  
You're the one on my mind,  
got me working over time.  
I only think about love, don't you?  
Talk to me, don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you.  
I try to love you, baby.  
  
Work, it can work.  
(Gonna work out, gonna work out.)  
Work, it's gonna work, yeah,  
'cause I love you.  
Heaven knows and I know it can...  
  
Work, it can work.  
(Gonna work out, gonna work out.)  
Work, it's gonna work, yeah,  
'cause I love you.  
Heaven knows and I know it can...
