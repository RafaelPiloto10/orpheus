You the one that I dream about all day  
You the one that I think about always  
You are the one so I make sure I behave  
My love is your love, your love is my love  
  
Baby, I love you, I need you here  
Give me all the time  
Baby we meant to be  
You got me, smiling all the time  
  
'Cause you know how to give me that  
You know how to pull me back  
When I go runnin', runnin'  
Tryin' to get away from loving ya  
  
You know how to love me hard  
I won't lie, I'm falling hard  
Yep, I'm falling for ya  
But there's nothin' wrong with that  
  
You the one that I dream about all day  
You the one that I think about always  
You are the one so I make sure I behave

You the one that I think about always  
You are the one so I make sure I behave  
My love is your love, your love is mine  
  
Baby come, tear me now, hold me now  
Make me come alive  
You got the sweetest touch  
I'm so happy, you came in my life  
  
'Cause you know how to give me that  
You know how to pull me back  
When I go runnin', runnin'  
Tryin' to get away from loving ya  
You know how to love me hard  
I won't lie, I'm falling hard  
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin' wrong with that

When you put it down  
You shouldnt've give it to me good like that  
Shouldnt've hit it like that, had me yellin' like that  
Didn't know you would've had me coming back  
  
You the one that I'm feeling  
You the one that I'm loving  
Ain't no other, niggas like you  
No there's just one, one, one  
No baby just one, one, one
