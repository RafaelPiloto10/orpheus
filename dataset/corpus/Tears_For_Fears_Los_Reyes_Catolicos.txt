When time is like a needle  
And night is the longest day  
A home is a cathedral  
A place where a king can pray  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane  
Los Reyes Catolicos [Repeat: x4]  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
  
A home is like a castle  
A place where a king can reign  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Ghosts all gone  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane
