When we tried to rework all of this  
Each to her rendition  
Painted ourselves in a corner  
Lost for ideas blindly fishing  
For a compliment or kindness  
Just to bring us into view  
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you  
I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words  
After all that we've been through  
I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
I believe in you and I believe in love
