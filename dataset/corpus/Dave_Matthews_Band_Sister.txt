Pass the time with you in mind  
It's a rather quiet night  
Feel the ground against my back  
Counting stars against the black  
Thinking bout another day  
Wishing I was far away  
Whether they were dreams or worries  
You were there with me  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister keep me  
  
I hope you always know it's true  
I would never make it through  
We could make the sun go down  
Just by walking away  
Playing like we used to play  
Our kingdom will never go away  
Feel you beating in my chest  
I'll be dead without  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister will you keep me?  
  
I would never make it through  
Hope you always know it's true  
You could make the heaven's fall  
Just by walking away  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister keep me
