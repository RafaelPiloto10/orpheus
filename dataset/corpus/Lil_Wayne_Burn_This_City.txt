Open up the Maserati fuck the highway troopas

Try to run up on the block why bother  
I'ma shoot him the Pump then I go and throw his body in a ditch and wont
nobody ever find you and wont nobody talk cause I'm a real street mobster  
Ghetto gangstas that don't eat pasta  
Only fuckin' with tha shrimp and tha lobsta  
Murder tha pussy hole in ya boy when I'm dressed up like a roster  
New Orleans and shot connect stay burnin' sticky  
And we getting stomachs instead a getin' money that's why I'm on 50, shit

Sicka than a bird flu I am the Birdman Jr.  
And you niggas just bird food  
We livin' in a whirlpool u gotta eat or get ate  
And you look like bait  
Don't you stick one hand over the gate  
This dog treat you niggas just like steak... Dinner

Murder renegade music my flow stupid
