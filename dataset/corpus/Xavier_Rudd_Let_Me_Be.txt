Hmm hmm, let me because  
I want to be free now  
Oh oh, free to see, yeah well  
Want to walk away, oh oh  
Let me feel my feet  
Let me be, free  
  
Time and time and time we see these  
Acts against humanity, well,  
Each for each and each will be then  
Shed blood for what they each believe, well  
On and on and on we go well,  
Some will you see and, some won't be  
True for you and truth will lead you  
To a sense of, well now, peace
