Pretty little baby, lying in a manger  
Staring at the strangers, who?ve come so many miles  
They were told to follow the star up in the heavens  
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child.  
  
Could this be the kingdom of the high and mighty  
Is this the ruler, born here tonight  
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle  
Oh, you must be the savior, pretty little baby child.  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes the greatest of miracles  
Come from the smallest of things  
They knew when they knelt there beside him  
They were looking in the eyes of the king.  
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together  
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child.  
  
Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness  
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes  
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus  
To the savior before us. Pretty little baby child.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For ever and ever pretty little baby child
