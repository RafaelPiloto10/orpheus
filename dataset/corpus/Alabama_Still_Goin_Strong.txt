Through the years  
We've had our ups and downs  
Ain't been a block  
We haven't been around  
  
We've been one step up  
And two steps back  
But our love's gotten  
Right back on track  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin' on a midnight run  
We're rollin' right along  
Still goin' strong  
  
In tryin' times  
When push came down to shove  
We'd pull together  
And show what we're made of  
  
With a lot of love  
And a little faith  
We moved every mountain  
In our way  
  
We're still goin' strong  
With a fire that's hotter  
Than the desert sun  
We're still turnin' on  
Still goin' strong  
  
It's still as good  
As it's ever been  
Our love's just gettin'  
It's second wind  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Two hearts poundin'  
Like a rock and roll drum  
Lovin' all night long  
Still goin' strong  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin' on a midnight run  
We're rollin' right along  
Still goin' strong  
  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong
