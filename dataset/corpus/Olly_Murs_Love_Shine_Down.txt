Where do I go from here, tell me baby  
If I can't have you near  
I've been running in circles for you  
Got a fever of a hundred and two  
Can't fake how I feel for you  
  
This foolish heart of mine gets frustrated  
Can't read between the lines  
And the signal that I'm waiting for  
Is always locked behind the door  
And It makes me want you more  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
If I could have my way, I'd take you baby  
Out every night and day  
You're the battery to my heart  
And without you I can't start  
Don't you leave me in the dark  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me  
  
Just shine it right down  
(You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me)  
  
Just shine it right down  
(You know I wanna believe  
I wanna see the light  
So let your love shine down on me)  
  
So let your love shine down on me  
And I will surrender  
Wear my heart upon your sleeve  
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever  
So let your love shine down on me
