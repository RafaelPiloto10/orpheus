I'd spent a lot more time in the pouring rain covering my head  
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names  
I was to afraid  
And I'd gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town  
Mama said I couldn't  
I'd went skinny dippin' with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to  
I didn't  
Oooh I, I'd done a lot of things different  
  
I wish I woulda spent more time with my dad when he was alive  
Now I don't have the chance  
I wish I would've told my brother how much I loved him before he went off to
war  
But I just shook his hand  
I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to  
But I was afraid to go  
I wish I'd woulda listened when they said "boy your gunna wish you hadn't"  
But I wouldn't  
Oooh I, I'd don't a lot of things different  
  
People say they wouldn't change a thing  
Even if they could  
Oooh but I would  
  
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it  
I should've bought it  
But I didn't  
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow trimed in blue's and green's  
But I wouldn't let her  
It wouldn't have hurt nothin'  
She loved to be held and kisses and touched  
But I didn't do it  
Not nearly enough  
And if I'd known that dance was gunna be our last dance  
I'd asked that band to play  
On and on  
Ooon and ooon  
Oooh I, I'd done a lot of things different  
  
People say they wouldn't change a thing  
Even if they could  
Oooh but I would  
Ooooh oooh  
Oooh I, I'd done a lot of things different  
Oooh I, I'd done a lot of things  
I think we'd all do a lot of things different
