I've lost my temperature  
Where've all my sunny days gone  
Is there any place to stay warm  
It's not easy when your gone  
Tell me how I'm s'pose to go on  
Right now I don't be strong  
  
With the rain  
Comes more pain  
You never know (damn the weather)  
Hard to hide  
When I cry  
This pain inside (aint ge'n better)  
Body shakes  
I feel so numb (nuuumb)  
I'm shiverin  
Why did you go[chorus]  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I can't breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degrees  
Nowhere else to go  
Froze  
  
My heart struggles to beat yeah  
I need a life line  
And I would rather die  
Before I, start to freeze yeah  
Live my life in fear, no way  
  
With the rain  
Comes more pain  
You never know (damn the weather)  
Hard to hide  
When I cry  
This pain inside (aint ge'n better)  
Body shakes  
I feel so numb (nuuumb)  
I'm shiverin  
Why did you go[chorus]  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I can't breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degreese  
Nowhere else to go  
Frozebridge:  
I am so cold  
My body's frozen  
I am so cold  
Frozen  
  
Froze (my body is froze)  
(X8)[Chorus:]  
My body is froze  
Every part of me cold  
My hearts achin  
And I can't breathe  
Souls breakin  
Minus 31 degreese  
Nowhere else to go  
Froze  
(X2)
