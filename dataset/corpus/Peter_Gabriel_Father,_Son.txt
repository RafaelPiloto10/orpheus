Father, son  
Locked as one  
In this empty room  
Spine against spine  
Yours against mine  
Till the warmth comes through  
  
Remember the breakwaters down by the waves  
I first found my courage  
Knowing daddy could save  
I could hold back the tide  
With my dad by my side  
  
Dogs, plows and bows  
We move through each pose  
Struggling in our separate ways  
Mantras and hymns  
Unfolding limbs  
Looking for release through the pain  
  
And the yogi's eyes are open  
Looking up above  
He too is dreaming of his daddy's love  
With his dad by his side  
Got his dad by his side  
  
Can you recall  
How you took me to school  
We couldn't talk much at all  
It's been so many years  
And now these tears  
Guess I'm still a child  
  
Out on the moors  
We take a pause  
See how far we have come  
You're moving quite slow  
How far can we go  
Father and son  
  
With my dad by my side  
With my dad by my side  
Got my dad by my side  
With me
