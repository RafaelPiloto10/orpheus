I don't believe in the rockin' pneumonia  
And who cares if maybelline was a cow  
Didn't see 'em rollin' over beethoven  
Or hear the blues wrote for chairman mao  
  
I don't care if they're rockin' the jailhouse  
Or who's a-courting with a peggy sue  
I don't care if they call you a hound dog  
As long as I can make love to you  
Love to you  
  
I love makin' love to you  
  
Who cares about the great'a pretender  
And who the hell was a'johnny b.goode  
Rave on it's a crazy feeling  
Rave on like you know you should  
You know you should  
  
I love makin' love to you  
I love makin' love to you  
  
I don't care about the shakes in my knee bone  
As long as I've got my blue suede shoes  
Don't mind if you tickle my thigh bone  
As long as I can make love to you love to you,babe  
  
I love makin' love to you  
I love makin' love to you
