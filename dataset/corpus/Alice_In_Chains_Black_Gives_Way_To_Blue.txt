I don't want to feel no more  
It's easier to keep falling  
Imitations are pale  
Emptiness all tomorrows  
  
Haunted by your ghost  
  
Lay down, black gives way to blue  
Lay down, I'll remember you  
  
Fading out by design  
Consciously avoiding changes  
Curtain's drawn, now it's done  
Silencing all tomorrows  
  
Forcing a goodbye  
  
Lay down, black gives way to blue  
Lay down, I'll remember you
