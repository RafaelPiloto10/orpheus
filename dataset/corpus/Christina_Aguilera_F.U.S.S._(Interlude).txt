You know who you are  
This is for you  
  
Hmmm, yeah, ooh yeah, ohh  
  
I thought I knew who you were  
I see now you were a lesson to learn  
And all I am to you now is a bridge that's been burned  
Now I was the first to believe  
I made you part of my musical dream  
And your thanks to me, came without an apology, yeah  
  
We wrote Loving Me 4 Me, don't Walk Away  
Can't Hold Us Down, all part of our history  
Don't forget Infatuation, I'm a Fighter  
Feeling Underappreciated  
  
Yeah, this song is for you to remind you  
That I moved on, sang my songs,  
I've got no regrets  
  
Mmm, oh  
  
Hope it all was worth it, uh  
Looks like I didn't need you  
Still got the album out  
Ha
