There was an I'll wind blowing  
Through my hair last night  
That froze me in my blue jeans.  
I couldn't find a light  
I know that something's coming  
I can feel it in my bones  
Thank God  
For those old country boys,  
I ain't out here alone.  
  
My friends all tell me  
I got daggers in my eyes  
There's an anger in my heart  
That they don't realize  
I'm mad as hell at something  
That I don't understand  
Thank God  
I'm on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band.  
  
Thank God  
I'm on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band.  
We may not be good looking  
But we sure get outta hand  
Was that The Devil's stagecoach  
Flying over the Rio Grande?  
Thank God  
I'm on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band.  
  
I swear that The Devil  
Came visiting me last night  
Surrounded my old stagecoach  
With his eerie light  
He was pounding on my windows  
Rattling my wheels  
I may not be The Devil  
But I know just how he feels.  
  
Thank God  
I'm on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band.  
We may not be good looking  
But we sure get outta hand  
Was that The Devil's stagecoach  
Flying over the Rio Grande?  
Thank God  
I'm on the road tonight  
With this old hillbilly band.
