When will I see you again?  
When will we share precious moments?  
  
Will I have to wait forever?  
Will I have to suffer and cry the whole night through?  
  
When will I see you again?  
When will our hearts beat together?  
  
Are we in love or just friends?  
Is this my beginning or is this the end?  
  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
  
Are we in love or just friends?  
Is this my beginning or is this the end?  
  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?  
When will I see you again?
