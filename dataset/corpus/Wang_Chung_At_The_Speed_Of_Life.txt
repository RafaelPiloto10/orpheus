(jack hues)  
A man lives in the city  
Surrounded by machines  
They take away his pity  
And give him what he dreams  
A stream of information  
On a green letter screen  
Makes him feel in touch with the world  
And sure of what it means  
Chorus:  
At the speed of light you're in endless night  
At the speed of sound you don't see the ground  
And in your sports car with the windows down  
And the radio on and you don't stop talking  
Thanks, I'll keep walking  
I'm doing things in my own way  
Well I'm doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes it's own way  
At the speed of life  
A man lives in the city  
Distracted by the news  
From sitting down with the ones he loves  
Or taking time to choose  
And what of conversation?  
And what is left when he dies?  
Is there a diary of an honest man  
To stand against the lies?  
Repeat chorus  
I'm doing things for their own sake  
A picture on a screen won't do  
I need to feel and touch it too  
Do what I feel  
I'm doing things for their own sake  
I gotta find that essential, deep emotion  
Get unhooked from this low commotion  
And do what I feel  
I'm doing things in my own way  
I'm doing things in my own way  
Well I'm doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes it's own way  
At the speed of life  
This is the speed of life
