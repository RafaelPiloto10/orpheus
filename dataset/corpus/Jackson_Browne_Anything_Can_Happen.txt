Time will come when we know what happened here  
Change will come in time and make it clear  
We learn one thing if we learn at all  
In the secret wars we call our lives, anything can happen  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways, a life demands  
But whatever pleasure this life may allow  
I'll give you the love I have for you now  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of fear  
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night and people disappear  
But you hear my heart and you know I'm still here  
Although you know and I know you know  
While I swear I'll never let you go, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love can happen here  
Anything can  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
I'll always remember this time, this place  
The hope in your voice, the light on your face  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of pain  
People give their lives to making war and we call those people sane  
But I love you where your dreams remain  
Though you never say it anymore  
One day there'll be an end to this war and who knows  
We may see what we're here for, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love has found us here  
Anything can, it can happen  
Anything can, anything can happen  
Anything, anything, anything, anything
