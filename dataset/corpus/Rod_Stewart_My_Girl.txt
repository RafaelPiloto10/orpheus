Miss you babe  
Miss you babe  
  
She's everywhere I go  
She's everything I know  
And now I think she's finally  
Touched my soul  
She's heaven here on earth  
Much more than I deserve  
And I don't wanna ever let her go  
I'm getting used to all her ways  
Everything she says  
Her smiles, her frowns  
Her ups and all her downs  
  
She's every move that I make  
She's every breath I take  
She's got a hold on me  
That I don't wanna break  
  
I mean my girl bring her home to me  
My girl can't wait for you to see  
My girl means everything to me  
My girl my girl  
  
My friends keep coming round  
Saying come out on the town  
What's wrong, you ain't the guy  
We used to know  
And I tell them I say  
Without her by my side  
I'm only half alive  
I love her so bad  
And I don't care if it shows  
  
I mean my girl  
Bring her home to me  
My girl, means everything to me  
My girl, can't wait for you to see  
My girl, my girl, my girl  
  
At last my heart has found a home  
This time I know where I belong  
I mean my girl  
Bring her home to me  
My girl, can't wait for you to see  
My girl, means everything to me  
My girl, I just wanna see  
My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl
