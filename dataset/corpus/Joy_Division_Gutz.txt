... 3, 4 warsaw!  
Don't talk to me girl, you know it's not nice.  
Don't laugh at murder, I won't pay the price.  
The facts are too high-powered, so sickened thrill,  
I'd give that mess up 'cos it makes you so ill.  
  
Blame bad things on me, whatever you do.  
When I come home I will be different from you.  
You're such a chictalk, you're really trussed up.  
Don't wanna talk to you, just left me your mum.  
  
Don't be a puppet, always rush you around.  
One just for you photo, try and tire me down.  
I won't tell him I talk like this all night,  
He must be worried 'cos you're sounding so trite.  
  
Respect is only normal, the way to our lives.  
Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife.  
We'll never change you, if you start acting that way.  
If do keep mouths all open, I'll never get a say.  
You know what's special, it's as dark as I say.  
Can you see me, just ourselves,  
No comment, copycat!
