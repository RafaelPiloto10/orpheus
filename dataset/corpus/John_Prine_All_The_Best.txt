I wish you love  
And happiness  
I guess I wish you  
All the best  
I wish you don't  
Do like I do  
And ever fall in love with  
Someone like you  
Cause if you fell  
Just like I did  
You'd probably walk around the block  
Like a little kid.  
But kids don't know  
They can only guess  
How hard it is  
To wish you happiness  
  
I guess that love  
Is like a Christmas card  
You decorate a tree  
You throw it in the yard  
It decays and dies  
And the snowmen melt  
Well I once knew love  
I knew how love felt  
Yeah I knew love  
Love knew me  
And when I walked  
Love walked with me  
And I got no hate  
And I got no pride  
Well I got so much love  
That I cannot hide  
  
Say you drive a Chevy  
Say you drive a Ford  
You say you drive around the town  
Till you just get bored  
Then you change your mind  
For something else to do  
And your heart gets bored with your mind  
And it changes you  
Well it's a doggone shame  
And it's an awful mess  
I wish you love  
I wish you happiness  
I wish you love  
I wish you happiness  
I guess I wish you  
All the best
