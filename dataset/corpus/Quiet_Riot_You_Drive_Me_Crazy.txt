Tiger eyes  
Just as wild as you make me feel  
Tantalize  
Make my designs hard to conceal  
Trying hard to hold on to you  
Waterfall in my hand you're slippin' through  
Tried so hard it makes me scream  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy  
It makes me feel so good, so good, so good  
Will you stay and give me time to work it out  
Day by day  
Lose my mind without a doubt  
Don't want to hang you up this way  
Just wanna lay you down and play  
I'm gonna go out of my mind  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy  
It makes me feel so good, so good, so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
It makes me feel so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
It makes me feel so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do
