Everybody look at me,  
But nobody knows  
What I have, who I am...  
  
Don't tell me what I have to do  
(To do)  
I'm not have you, my shoe!  
(My shoe)  
I know wahat you say  
I'm just one more chick,  
But now... Stop!  
  
Not a chick, not your,  
I'm a doll!  
If you think I'm that girl  
You are wrong 'cause now I am..  
Original!  
  
What you lie to my friends?  
You are a beutiful, but no mind.  
I'm a doll, I want to be more pretty  
No... Stop!  
  
Chorus (3X)  
Can't you see me?  
You are beautiful, no minds.
