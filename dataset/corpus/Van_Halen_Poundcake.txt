Poundcake  
Yeah, she's gotta have a soul,  
Or it won't feel right,  
We're just playin', clean and simple  
Wrapped up, nice and tight  
In a home-grown, and down home,  
That makes a woman  
Cookin' up that old time long lost recipe, for me  
It's gettin' hard to find  
Guess it ain't hip enough now  
You take an average guy  
Who can't identify  
And there's a short supply  
Of the fine, fine stuff,  
Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on some of that  
Shake it up, pick it out nice,  
Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on outta there,  
I still love my baby's poundcake  
Home grown, and down home,  
Yeah, that's the woman,  
Still cookin' up an old time, long lost recipe  
Lemme get on some of that,  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, yeah  
I want some of that  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho  
Gimme some of that, uh ha, uh ha, ha...Ow!  
Oh, got some real fine, poundcake...  
I've been out there,  
Tried a little bit of everything  
Its all sex without love  
I felt the real thing is poundcake  
Home grown, and down home,  
Yeah, that's the woman,  
Still cookin with that old time, long lost recipe, yeah, whew!  
She's down home and down home,  
Oh, that's my woman,  
Gimme some of that,  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho,  
Lemme hold that  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho  
Uh, uh ha, uh ha ho, yeah  
Home grown, and down home, whew!  
C'mon, babe,  
Gimme some of that  
Gimme some of that  
Home grown, way down home, yeah!  
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, yeah  
Gimme some of that, whew!  
C'mon babe!
