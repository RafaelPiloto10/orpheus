Plead with my saint  
Wash his hands and feet  
Find his complaints  
Make this world complete  
  
[Chorus:]  
And this heaven that I'm making  
It can't come quickly enough  
And the big wave that I'm taking  
It feels like I'm just waking up  
  
Find out, don't think  
I can't get used to it  
And right on the brink  
I end up losing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll be there  
If all of creation is kind  
And each conversation I hear  
As I'm walking in through the crowd  
As if I could float through the air  
  
This Heaven...  
  
This is Heaven that I'm making  
This is Heaven...  
  
It can't come quickly enough  
And the people that I'm taking  
It can't come by quickly enough  
  
If there is Hell on Earth  
There must be Heaven, too  
Both in one place  
And not a second to lose
