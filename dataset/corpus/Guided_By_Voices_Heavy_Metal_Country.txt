Two connected tongues  
Flesh beginnings  
But still you couldn't taste  
Cyanide in the open skies below us  
Below us  
A two way street  
  
And oh, we've eaten all the dough  
It's our chance to polist Spanky's boots  
Finally see we cannot ?? we loath it  
But in consolation gives us cash ??  
  
Chorus  
Come with high regard from heavy metal country  
They write you super-love and seal it with the kick  
And now the creator's skull is cracked  
Out come the underground with artificial love  
They're singing loud, so very proud  
To show the mess they made  
At Zoo Arcade  
When something central took away their guns  
  
Sometimes I'm programmed better than the other ones  
Sometimes I'm programmed to shoot the shot around the world  
Sometimes I'm programmed  
  
Chorus
