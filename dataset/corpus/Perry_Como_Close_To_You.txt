Why do birds suddenly appear,  
Every time you are near?  
Just like me, they long to be, close to you  
  
Why do stars fall down from the sky,  
Every time you walk by?  
Just like me, they long to be, close to you  
  
On the day that you were born,  
The angels got together,  
An' decided to create a dream come true  
  
So they sprinkled mood dust in your hair of gold  
An' starlight in your eyes of blue  
  
That is why, all the boys in town,  
Follow you, all around,  
Just like me, they long to be, close to you!

Close to you( Close to you, close to you)
