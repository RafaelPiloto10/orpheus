Heaven may be an answer  
If you're lookin' for Eden in the sky  
On your waters I see a strange reflection  
Rumor has it I'll see you when I die  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California  
In California you watch the shadow dancer  
Floating gently, gently on the sea  
In California you're such a strange romancer  
Come and see me when the world has set you free  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California
