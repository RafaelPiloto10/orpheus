I who never had much I now have a treasure  
A love too great to measure  
I am blessed with happiness  
And I'm done with loneliness  
  
I who walked all alone not really knowing  
Till now just where I was going  
I am blessed because this day  
You came show me the way  
  
Till now I was like a grain of sand  
Lost on a lonely beach  
Yes till now I could never understand  
That this was within my reach  
  
I who cried to the moon see only sunshine  
Because darling you're mine  
I am blessed with wealth untold  
A love worth more than gold
