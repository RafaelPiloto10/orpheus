The sweet perfume of flowers in bloom  
Remind me of you  
But you're more than just a memory  
The things that you do to me  
If only you knew  
  
I've tried hard, had to be strong  
Now I don't know if I can go on  
  
[Chorus]  
There's no world without you  
I miss you, my friend  
There's no world without you  
This can't be the end  
  
Remember the night holding me tight  
Just me and you  
I remember the day you went away  
What was I to do  
If you came home, one of these days  
Would I hold back or would I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've tried hard, had to be strong  
Now I don't know if I can go on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no world without you  
This can't be the end
