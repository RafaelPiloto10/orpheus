If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all  
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
If I never bring her flowers I'll never see her smile  
If I never try to kiss her she'll never drive me wild  
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one get a hold on me  
But I can't keep my hands off her  
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl  
  
If I never let me love her I'll never settle down  
And I'll never put roots in this God forsaken town  
And I'll never say "I do" or step foot in a church  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one put a hold on me  
But I can't keep my hands off her  
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl  
  
If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all  
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
Yeah the trouble with never is never never works  
At least not with her, oh no
