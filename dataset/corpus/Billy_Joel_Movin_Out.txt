Anthony works in the grocery store  
Savin his pennies for some day  
Mama Leone left a note on the door  
She said "Sonny move out to the country"  
Ah but working too hard can give you  
A heart attack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack  
You ought-a know by now  
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?  
Is that all you get for your money?  
  
And it seems such a waste of time  
If that's what it's all about  
Mama if that's movin up then I'm movin out  
Mm I' movin out, mm oo oo uh huh mm hm  
  
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin the beat  
At night he becomes a bartender  
He works at Mister Cacciatores  
Down on Sullivan Street  
Across from the medical center  
And he's tradin in his Chevy for  
A Cadillac ack ack ack ack ack  
You ought-a know by now  
If he can't drive with a broken back  
At least he can polish the fenders  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
You should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mi mind  
You ought-a know by now  
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime  
Is that all you get for your money  
And if that's what you have in mind  
Then that's what you're all about  
Good luck movin up cause I'm movin out  
Mm I'm movin out Mm oo oo uh huh mm hm
