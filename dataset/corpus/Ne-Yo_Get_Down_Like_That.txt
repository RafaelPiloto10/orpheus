When I'm single it don't really matter who it is  
Or how many I decide to kick it with  
'Long as she can understand how I do this  
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks  
  
But when I settle down  
Find a woman to look for  
Still may be a couple cuties at my door  
Baby we can't get down like we did before  
  
And get mad when I tell them  
I can't be like that no more  
  
Girl, you know I got a girl  
I just don't get down like that  
I don't get down like that  
Baby, you fine  
Baby you's a dime  
But I just don't get down like  
I don't get down like that  
  
Understand, baby girl, that I'm a totally new man  
I don't live to crush as many as I can  
No more, I found a girl that changed my whole game plan  
She the one (she the one) only one that I'm wanting  
  
And I know girl I know that you really want it bad  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted  
All the things we used to do I kinda miss it  
It ain't nothing you can't get as good as this is  
  
Girl, you know I got a girl  
I just don't get down like that  
I don't get down like that  
Baby, you fine  
  
Baby you's a dime  
But I just don't get down like  
I don't get down like that  
  
Baby, all I can say is I'm sorry  
Since I found me my lady  
Thinkin' about cheating would be crazy  
I don't get down...  
  
Baby all I can say is I'm sorry  
Since I found me my lady  
Thinkin' about cheating would be crazy  
And I don't get down...  
  
Girl, you know I got a girl  
I just don't get down like that  
I don't get down like that  
Baby, you fine  
Baby you's a dime  
But I just don't get down like  
I don't get down like that
