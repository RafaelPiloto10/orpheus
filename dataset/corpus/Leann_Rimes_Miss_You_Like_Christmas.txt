How long has it been  
can't remember when  
yeah, it's been awhile  
years look good on you  
but I expect them to  
I sure missed that smile  
Look you got me grinning  
bet I'm blushing too  
don't have to be a genius  
to see the honest truth  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's just how it's been  
there's that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure I've gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, I just do  
The leaves begin to change  
the first frost is back again  
all the cards and pumpkin pie  
Jingle Bells, and Silent Night  
And an all familiar end  
I can't deny  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's just how it's been  
there's that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure I've gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, I just do  
Ooh, I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, ooh, I just do
