When I look at the letter that you wrote to me  
It's you that I'm thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet  
I remember our faded love  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you darlin' more and more every day  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past and all the pleasure we had,  
As I watch the mating of a dove,  
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.  
I remember our faded love.  
  
[Chorus]
