I had a dog, his name was Jim  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Took all of my old clothes with him  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
He was twelve years old when his trip began  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Hauling down the highway in my old sedan  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Now I wish someone'd tell me where old Jim went  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
'Cause he took all the money that I saved for rent  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Time he came home, he was seventeen  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
That's a hundred nineteen to you and me  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Now I'm gonna go up to the mountain  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Singing for Dave who's swimming in the fountain  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway dogs  
Oh, runaway dog
