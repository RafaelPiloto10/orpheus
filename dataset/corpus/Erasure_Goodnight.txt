Sleepless nights don't bother me at all  
If dawn comes I won't worry  
Something deep inside keeps me awake  
I wish that you were here right beside me, woah  
  
I recall when I was very young  
And could not go to sleep  
My father sang me songs to make me tired  
But memories don't make it easier  
  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me  
  
Now I lie awake and it's no fun  
Tossing and turning  
I'd call you if it weren't so very late  
But telephones don't bring you close to me, woah  
  
I recall the times we stayed up late  
Wide awake but still dreaming  
There was nothing on this earth could make me tired  
But memories don't make it easier  
  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me
