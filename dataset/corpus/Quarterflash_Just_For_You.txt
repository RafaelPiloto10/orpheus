Some do it for love and some for less  
Some do it for touch and tenderness  
They do it for power and for control  
They do it for money and for rock 'n' roll  
Some people don't know why they do  
But I, I know, I do it just for, just for  
  
Just for you and nobody else  
Just for you, baby, can't you tell  
Just for you, you know what I mean  
Just for you even in my dreams  
Where I say "Talk to me, couchez-vouz"  
It's easy with you  
I know what you need  
I know what to do  
Just for you  
  
Some to heal and some to hurt  
Some for thrills and some for dirt  
Some to remember, some to forget  
Some do it for anything they can get  
Oh, some people don't know why they do  
But I, I know, I do it just for, just for  
  
Just for you in the night  
Just for you, baby, dressed in white  
Just for you, you know what I mean  
Just for you even in my dreams  
Where I say "Talk to me, couchez-vouz"  
It's easy with you  
I know what you need  
I know what to do  
Just for you
