Some say you're crazy  
Say that you're no good  
Say your family's cursed with bad blood  
But I think you're cute and misunderstood  
And I wouldn't change you if I could  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
Some say you're bitter  
Think you're mean  
Uncouth untamed and unrestrained  
But I think you're sensitive and sweet  
Stay as you are  
Don't change a thing  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
Some say you're bawdy  
Wicked and wild  
A restless useless juvenile  
But I think you're funny and I like your smile  
Want to be with you  
Want you to stay a while  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
A no count mixed up  
Amount to nothing  
A day away from a bum on the street  
Some low class kind of royalty  
That's what they say about you  
When they're talking to me  
  
Some say you're bad  
A bad bad seed  
You love to play with fire you love gambling  
But I know what you love and I know what you need  
And I like it when you play with me  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me
