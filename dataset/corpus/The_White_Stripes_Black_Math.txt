Don't you think that I'm bound to react now?  
My fingers definitely turning to black now  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice  
  
My books are sitting at the top of the stack now  
The longer words are really breaking my back now  
Maybe I'll learn to understand,  
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand  
  
Mathematically turning the page  
Unequivocally showing my age  
I'm practically center stage  
Undeniably earning your wage  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice  
  
Listen master can I ask you a question?  
Is it the fingers, or the brain  
That you're teaching the lesson?  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice
