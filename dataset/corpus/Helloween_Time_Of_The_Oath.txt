In a circle of fire  
On a cold winter night  
I spoke out my desire  
Made a promise  
I couldn't hide, no!  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
"Your time has come,  
Your mind belongs to me."  
  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
See me covered with sadness  
And I'll soon wish to die  
When that overcoming madness  
Is eating up my mind  
  
Here and now  
I look back at a good time  
No more lie - I slowly say goodbye  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
"Your time has come,  
Just slowly say good-bye."  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
Di-es i-rae, di-es il-la  
Sol-vet sae-cium in fa-villa  
Quan-tus tre-mor est fu-tu-rus  
Quan-do ju-dex est ven-turus
