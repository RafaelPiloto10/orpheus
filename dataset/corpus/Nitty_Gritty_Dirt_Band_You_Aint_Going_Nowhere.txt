Clouds so swift, the rain won't lift  
Gates won't close, the railings froze  
So get your mind off wintertime  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Buy me a flute, and a gun that shoots  
Tail gates and substitutes  
Strap yourself to a tree with roots  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Well I don't care how many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
So pack up your money, and pick up your tent  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
And genghis khan he could not keep  
All his men supplied with sleep  
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep  
When we get up to it  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair
