There may be trouble ahead  
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and
romance  
Let's face the music and dance  
Before the fiddlers have fled  
  
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have THE chance  
Let's face the music and dance  
Soon, we'll be without the moon  
Humming a different tune - and then...  
  
There may be teardrops to shed  
So (But) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and
romance  
(Let's face the music and dance, dance)  
(Let's face the music - let's HEAR that music)  
Let's face the music and dance
