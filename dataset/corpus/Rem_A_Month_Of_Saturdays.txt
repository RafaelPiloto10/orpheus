Five o'clock Friday  
All my work is done  
I can hardly wait  
Let's take the server  
Let's sling it around  
Let's make it taste so sweet  
  
I wanna take all the Saturdays  
I wanna stay up late  
I wanna stomp my feet on the ground  
I wanna celebrate  
  
A month of Saturdays, Saturdays  
A month of Saturday, Saturdays, ah  
  
I'm tired of waiting for the weekend to begin (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)  
I'm tired of punching in (Wednesday, Thursday)  
Give me a holiday that never ends (Friday, Saturday)  
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend  
Give me a weekend, weekend  
  
A month of Saturdays, Saturdays  
I'm talkin' Saturday, Saturdays, ah  
  
Shout  
  
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend
