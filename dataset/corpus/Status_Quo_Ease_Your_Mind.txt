I'm gonna ease your mind, I'm gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
I'm gonna let you know that I'll be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you, oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It won't be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you  
It's such a crying shame I had to break away  
To find the same old road  
But now I'm getting wise, and I've realized  
That that's a the way that it goes  
So put a smile upon your face  
Let me know I've found my place  
We've got no time to waste  
'Cos all the time for heaven's late  
Now don't you be afraid, it's gonna be the same  
I'll make it better with you  
I'm gonna ease your mind, I'm gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
I'm gonna let you know that I'll be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you, oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It won't be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you
