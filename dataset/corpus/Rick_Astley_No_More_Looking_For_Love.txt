I've been waiting  
For a love to call my own  
I've been hoping  
You would say you're coming home  
I will put my arms around you  
Baby, I'm so glad I found you  
There ain't nothing I can do  
Now that I'm in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
I've been thinking  
'Bout the way you looked last night  
I remember how we held each other tight  
As we lay beside the fire  
Felt the heat of pure desire  
There ain't nothing I can do  
Now that I'm in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
I'm so glad that love has come around  
I'm so thankful for the love I've found  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true
