Love me in the daytime  
Love me in the nighttime  
Anytime you love me  
Baby, that'll be the right time  
  
Put your arms around me  
When the lights are low  
Hug with the bearhug  
Never let me go  
  
Because I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you, you, you  
No, I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
We're as many as a million  
Red hot kisses overdue  
And I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
I know I've had  
My fill of dancing  
When my tired twinkletoes  
Begin to ache  
  
I know I've satisfied  
My sweet tooth  
When I tell the waiter  
He can take the cake  
  
I know I'm loaded up  
With champagne  
When my brain begins  
To do a spineroo  
  
But as long as I keep living  
I'll take anything you're giving  
Cause I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
Love me in the daytime  
Love me in the nighttime  
Anytime you love me  
That'll be the right time  
  
Put your arms around me  
When the lights are low  
Hug with the bearhug  
Never let me go  
  
Because I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you, you, you  
No, I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
We're as many as a million  
Red hot kisses overdue  
And I'm never, ever gonna  
Never, ever gonna  
Never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
You
