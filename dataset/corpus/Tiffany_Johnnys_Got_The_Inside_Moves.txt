Somebody's got me looking for you  
Somebody's got me looking for you  
Who can it be  
  
Are you alone now, I know she's with him  
Are you at home now, i'd like to come in  
  
Johnny's got the inside moves  
Johnny's got the inside moves  
On me

No matter how hard I try  
I can't get her out of your eye  
I don't know what you see in her  
  
Somebody's got me crying for you

Johnny's got the inside moves  
On me
