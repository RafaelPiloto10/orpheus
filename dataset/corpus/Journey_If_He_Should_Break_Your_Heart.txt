Please be wrong  
Please don't tell me it's really you  
Tell me eyes,tell my heart what I'm goin' through  
I believed, I believed I was over you  
  
If he should break your heart  
I'll always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
I'll be there, I'll be around  
If he should break your heart  
I'll be there  
  
Is this right  
I don't care I'm alone with you  
Here we are, once again you've got someone new  
Lonely hands, please don't do what you want to do  
  
If he should break your heart  
I'll always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
I'll be there, I'll be around  
  
If he should break your heart  
From my soul I say good-bye yesterday  
One more night alone, without the touch of you  
Then I start to break is it my mistake  
Tell me am I wrong for holdin' on to you  
  
If he should break your heart  
I'll always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
I'll be there, I'll be around  
  
If he should break you heart, I'll be there  
If he should break your, if he should break your  
If he should break your heart  
I'll be there, I'll be around
