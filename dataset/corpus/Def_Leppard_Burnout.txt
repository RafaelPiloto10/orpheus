Released on the cd-single for "goodbye"  
  
Friday night and I crashed your party  
Saturday night and I crashed your car  
Sunday night when you threw me out  
Couldn't believe I even got that far  
Look out of your bedroom window  
And tell me what you see  
Who's that standing in the shadows  
Oh baby you belong to me, yeah  
  
Place your bets cause I got a good feeling  
Hey over there, are you lookin' my way  
Electrified like a shock to the system  
You walk right through my dna  
  
If you could just walk for a mile in my shoes  
If you don't use loose your mind you got no mind to lose  
  
Bang bang gonna shoot you down  
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one  
Sweetheart.....buzzing like a fly  
Lock you, like a thief..... (? ? ) lullaby  
High hopes are sinking like a stone  
I swallow my pride but I'm choking on a fishbone  
Oh my, I gotta try, so step right up  
  
I'll give you what you want  
It's what you need  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
And what you need, yeah  
  
Head over heels and it's making me nervous  
Get on my knees and it's making me worse  
There's no way out so I pay lip-service  
If this thing is bigger than the both of us  
  
If you could just walk for a mile in my shoes  
If you don't use loose your mind you got no mind to lose  
  
Bang bang gonna shoot you down  
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one  
Sweetheart.....buzzing like a fly  
Lock you, like a thief..... (? ? ) lullaby  
High hopes are sinking like a stone  
I swallow my pride but I'm choking on a fishbone  
Oh my, I gotta try, so step right up  
  
I'll give you what you want  
It's what you need  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
And what you need, yeah  
  
Bang bang gonna shoot you down  
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one  
Oh my, I gotta try, so step right up  
  
I'll give you what you want  
It's what you need  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
And what you need, yeah  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
You know I'm gonna give you what you want  
And what you need, yeah
