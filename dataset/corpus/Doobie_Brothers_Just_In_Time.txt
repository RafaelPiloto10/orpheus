Just when you think you've seen your darkest night  
Look around  
Over there someone's waiting, right now  
Right now, just to make things right  
Love comes just in time  
Without lovin' the sun don't shine  
Love comes just in time  
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted  
Oh baby, love is all we need  
And when you think that love has let you down  
And every place you go it seems like such a lonely town  
You gotta just run away  
As fast as you can  
Reach out now, baby  
And love will take your hand  
Love comes just in time  
Without lovin' the sun don't shine  
Love comes just in time  
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted  
Oh baby, love is all we need
