The movie wasn't really doing so hot  
Said the new producer to the old big shot  
Its dying on the edge of the great midwest  
Sabu must tour or forever rest.  
Hey look ma  
Here comes the elephant boy  
Bundled all up in his corduroy  
Headed down south towards illinois  
From the jungles of east st. paul.  
His manager sat in the office alone  
Staring at the numbers on the telephone  
Wondering how a man could send a child actor  
To visit in the land of the wind chill factor.  
Sabu was sad the whole tour stunk  
The airlines lost the elephant's trunk  
The roadie got the rabies and the scabies and the flu  
They was low on morale but they was high on.
