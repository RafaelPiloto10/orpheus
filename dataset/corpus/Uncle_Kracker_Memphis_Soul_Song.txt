Looking back on everything  
And all the things that stay  
I can count on memories  
Because they don't go away  
Good times were hard to hold  
Until she came along  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
I'm not always there I know  
But she don't mind at all  
As pretty as a picture  
That hangs on my own wall  
She's like Mississippi  
When the sun comes up at dawn  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
She don't care what the game is  
She's always down to play  
My world without her  
Seems a million miles away  
She don't have to worry  
I know where I belong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
I've been dealt some aces  
And I've played them all the same  
But she's the only one  
That keeps me in the game  
No fame or fortune  
Could ever keep me gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
There's a magic down in Memphis  
That never seems to fade  
Even now them voices carry  
Like a lonely serenade  
It's the memories that still  
And always will be on my mind  
They move me every time.  
  
She sees the good  
In everything there is to see  
Sometimes I wonder  
What she ever sees in me  
I'm not always right you know  
But she's never led me wrong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
In all my travels  
I've never found a way  
To find the words that say  
The things I'd like to say  
I've sang some melodies  
But she's my favorite one  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.
