Put your loving hand out, baby  
I'm begging  
  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
Riding high when I was king  
Played it hard and fast  
Cause I had everything  
You walked away, won me then  
But easy come and easy go  
And it would end  
  
(Begging) I'm begging you  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
I need you to understand  
That I tried so hard  
To be your man  
The kind of man you want in the end  
Only then can I begin to live again  
  
An empty shell  
Used to be  
Shadow of my life  
Is hanging over me  
  
Broken man without a throne  
Wont even stand the devils dance  
To win my soul  
  
(Begging) begging you  
  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
I'm fighting hard  
To hold my own  
No, I just can't make it  
All alone  
  
I'm holdin on  
I can't fall back  
Now that big brass ring  
Is a shade of black  
  
(Begging) I'm begging you  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
(Begging) begging you
