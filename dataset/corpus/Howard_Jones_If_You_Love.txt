Chorus  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
Chorus  
Try to build a house on top of the highest tree  
It's dangerous and a bit risky  
But what about the view  
See the clouds and the mountains too  
Chorus  
Get your hands dirty  
Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
Never feel the pain  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)
