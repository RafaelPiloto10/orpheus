When two guys pull together its teamwork  
In foul or sunny weather it's teamwork  
What does it take to make any business climb  
You'll find it takes teamwork every time  
  
Incidentally, your jokes will kill the yokels its teamwork  
I love your hokey vocals its teamwork  
Like Fred Astaire and Ginger yet twice as chic  
We'll give them that teamwork, cheek to cheek  
  
Here we are, just like in Zanzibar  
Still nothing, still a star  
That's quite a stab from old flab  
They always pay us plenty for teamwork  
We split it 80-20 that's teamwork  
(Yours is tax free)  
When others start to part and go off the beam  
Like Siamese brothers we'll be on each other's team  
  
No fuss about the billing it's teamwork  
The smallest type is thrilling its teamwork  
Although we hold each other in low esteem  
We're loaded with teamwork  
Hey now  
What's life without teamwork  
Go boy  
Unless you got teamwork there's no team
