Talking 'bout a woman  
Talking 'bout a man  
I just can't seem to get it together  
Joining hands in hands  
  
The clock it ticks and it tocks  
But my heart is on the rocks  
I'm confused, so confused  
And i got to tell you something's wrong with the news  
  
Yeah  
I'm confused, so confused  
And i got to tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
  
Baby baby baby baby baby  
Let me feel you no good inside  
All i want to do is love you, love you, love you  
Instead of making you cry  
  
But when i come about  
I just met another woman the other side of town  
  
I'm confused, so confused  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
I'm confused, so confused  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
  
You ask me if i love you baby  
And i tell you that i do  
But don't you ask me if you're the only woman  
'cause i can't say that it's through  
  
Talking 'bout a woman  
Talking 'bout a man  
I just can't seem to get it together  
Joining with a man, hand in hand  
The clock it ticks and it tocks  
But my heart is on the rocks  
  
I'm confused, so confused  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
I'm confused, so confused  
  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
I'm confused  
Yes i am darling, so confused  
  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I can't choose  
I'm confused, have mercey, so confused  
And i gotta tell you something's wrong with the news  
I just can't, i just can't choose  
Oh yeah baby
