I met a boy called Frank Mills,  
On September 12th right here,  
In front of Waverley, but unfortunately,  
I lost his address.  
He was last seen with his friend,  
A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles,  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back.  
I love him but it embarrasses me,  
To walk down the street with him.  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere,  
And wears a white crash helmet.  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket,  
And on the back are written the names,  
"Mary" and "Mom" and "Hell's Angels".  
I would gratefully appreciate it,  
If you see him, tell him,  
I'm in the park with my girlfriend.  
And please,  
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back,  
Just him.
