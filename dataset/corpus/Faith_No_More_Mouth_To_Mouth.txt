You tied the knot  
A legend is what you bought  
I give you cold water and you  
Swear it was wine  
You bought time  
If you can fool yourself, then why not them?  
Just keep on passing it mouth to mouth to mouth  
  
I can dress up the dead man  
But I can't bring him back to life  
  
You tied the knot  
Peeled your skin off, leaving a bundle of nerves  
I give you a wet noodle, you swear that it was my tongue  
A sharp one  
Instead of that same old mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth  
  
I can dress up the dead man  
But I can't bring him back to life
