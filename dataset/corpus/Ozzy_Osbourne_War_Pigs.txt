Witches gather at black masses  
Bodies burning in red ashes  
On the hill the chruch in ruin  
Is the scene of evin doin'  
  
Is the place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rat cinder  
I guess it's the same  
Where ever you may go  
  
Oh, Lord yeah  
  
Carrying banners which denounce the Lord  
See me rocking in my grave  
See devil anoint my head with their black blood  
See them stick the stake through me  
  
Don't hold me back 'cause I just gotta go  
Satan's got a hold on my soul now  
Look in my brain and there was blood and seed  
Look in my eyes and there I go  
Yeah  
  
On the scene a priest appears  
Sinners falling at his knees  
Satan sends out funeral pyres  
Casts the priest into the fire  
  
It's the place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rat cinder  
I guess it's the same  
Where ever you may go  
  
Oh, Lord yeah
