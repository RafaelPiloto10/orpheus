It was overcast that day  
And I was feeling some kind of way  
I pulled the covers up over my head  
Tried reaching for you but that was then  
I can't forget  
My heart's hungover but ain't nothing different  
I close my eyes nothing but faded pictures of you, Of you  
  
Faded, baby, you're faded  
Baby, you're faded, faded  
  
You come and you go, you're just an echo  
  
Whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here  
So intangible, just like an echo  
Still trying to pretend it's possible  
To bring us back to life  
Boy we continue to subside  
Hanging over life on this rollescoaster ride  
I know your name baby sub consciously  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Boy you, boy you, faded, baby, you're faded  
Baby you're faded, faded  
Boy you just come and you go  
You come and you go  
You're just an echo  
Whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here  
So intangible, just like an echo  
Faded,  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Not there for me, not there for me  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Not there for me, not there for me
