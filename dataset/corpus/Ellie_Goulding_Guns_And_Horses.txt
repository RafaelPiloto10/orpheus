You're so quiet  
But it doesn't faze me  
You're on time  
You move so fast makes me feel lazy  
Let's join forces  
We've got our guns and horses  
I know you've been burned  
But every fire is a lesson learned  
  
I left my house  
Left my clothes  
Door wide open, heaven knows  
You're so worth it  
You are  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
Then maybe you'd feel the same  
I'd do it all for you, I would  
I would, I would, I would  
  
Let's type words  
'Cause they amount to nothing  
Play it down  
Pretend you can't take what you found  
But you found me  
On a screen you sit at permanently  
  
I left my house  
Left my clothes  
Door wide open  
Heaven knows  
You're so worth it, you are  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
Then maybe you'd feel the same  
I'd do it all for you, I would  
I would, I would, I would  
  
It's time to come clean,  
And make sense of everything  
It's time that we found out who we are  
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark  
I see your face in every star  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
The maybe you'd feel the same  
I'd do it all for you, I would  
I would, I would, I would  
  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd do it all for you
