Here you come draggin' in  
Three a.m. again  
Grinnin' that silly grin  
Smellin' just like sin  
Holdin' up that alibi that's tissue paper thin  
Diggin' down deeper and deeper  
In that hole you're already in  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth  
I know you been foolin' around  
With some fool from way 'cross town  
You're tearin' our good thing down  
Makin' me out your clown  
Lookin' for excuses that you know can't be found  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth  
And you could be more discreet  
With your love letters  
And honey, I smell some other man  
All over your Cashmere sweater  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth
