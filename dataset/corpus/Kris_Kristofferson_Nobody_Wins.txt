Any more it doesn't matter  
Who's right or wrong  
We've been injuring each other  
For much too long  
And it's too late to try to save  
What might have been  
It's over  
Nobody wins  
  
Make believin in forever  
Is just a lie  
And it seems a little sadder  
Each time we try  
'Cause it's a shame to make  
The same mistakes again  
And again  
It's over.  
Nobody wins  
  
We've gone too far too long  
Too far apart  
The lovin' was easy  
It's the livin' that's hard  
And there's no need to stay and see  
The way it ends  
It's over.  
Nobody wins
