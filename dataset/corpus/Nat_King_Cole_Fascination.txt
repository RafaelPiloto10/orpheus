It was fascination  
I know  
And it might have ended  
Right then, at the start  
Just a passing glance  
Just a brief romance  
And I might have gone  
On my way  
Empty hearted  
  
It was fascination  
I know  
Seeing you alone  
With the moonlight above  
Then I touch your hand  
And next moment  
I kiss you  
Fascination turned to love  
  
It was fascination  
I know  
Seeing you alone  
With the moonlight above  
Then I touch your hand  
And next moment  
I kiss you  
Fascination turned - to - love
