Then that's got shall get,  
Them that's not shall loose,  
So the Bible said and it still is news.  
Mama may have, papa may have,  
But God bless the child that's got his own,  
That's got his own.  
  
Well the strong gets more,  
While the weak ones fade,  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade.  
Mama may have, papa may have,  
But God bless the child that's got his own,  
That's got his own.  
  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round your door  
When it's gone and spending ends  
They don't come round no more  
  
Rich relations give  
Crusts of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
Mama may have, papa may have,  
But God bless the child that's got his own,  
That's got his own.
