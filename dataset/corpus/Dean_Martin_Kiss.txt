Kiss me say you'll miss  
Miss me, kiss me love, with heavenly affection  
Hold, hold me close to you  
Hold me, see me through  
With all your heart's protection  
  
Thrill, thrill me with your charms  
Take me in your arms  
And make my life perfection  
  
Kiss, kiss me darling then  
Kiss me once again  
Make my dreams come true  
  
Thrill, thrill me with your charms  
Take me in your arms  
And make my life perfection  
  
Kiss, kiss me darling then  
Kiss me once again  
Make my dreams come true
