I've been in and out of favor with lady luck  
I gotta tell you  
I've seen things I never wanted to see  
I've got to get back on my feet  
I feel like I've been sleeping  
Sweet, sweet time  
Has been a real good friend of mine  
  
Waiting for that change of season  
Oh the winter's been so long  
Searching for that rhyme or reason  
You've just got to  
  
[Chorus]  
Move on  
Hold it together, move on  
Life's so short, move on  
Only time will set you free  
You put your tears behind you  
Better get yourself where you want to be  
I think of all the days and nights I spent crying  
And I move on  
  
I've been in and out of favor with love  
Because I gotta tell you  
I've been things I never wanted to be  
And then some angel called me up  
He told me I was sleeping  
Said "don't waste time 'cause even angels say goodbye"  
  
Waiting for that change of season  
Oh the winter's been so long  
Searching for that rhyme or reason  
You've just got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And oh, there goes another season  
Getting hard to find a decent sonng to play  
But oh, I guess I got my reasons  
Everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k  
They ought to know by now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be luck in love someday
