No authority!  
I've spoke my mind a thousand times  
You can resist peacefully 'till the end of time  
There's a point where you reach an end of thought  
And the thought turns to action, emotion takes control!  
  
Authority! no authority! fuck authority!  
Police brutality!  
  
Politicians are pigs in business suits  
Triangle of power, the good are few  
If terrors what you represent  
Terrors what you're gonna get!  
  
Authority! no authority! fuck authority!  
Police brutality!  
  
First word learned was the word no!
