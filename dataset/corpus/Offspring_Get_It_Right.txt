I've been told that to get what you want  
You just gotta give what you can  
But I know for what I want it don't come easy as that  
They say, "Look out, boy  
Tomorrow comes and things will look better by then."  
But I'll look out the window  
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again  
  
[Chorus]  
Still can't get it right  
And for all I know  
I swear I never will  
  
Do you think you'd sell your soul  
To just have one thing to turn out right?  
For the thousandth time you turn and find  
That it just makes no difference to try  
  
Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself  
There's got to be a better way  
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling  
Dream of brighter days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No way out  
Same old stuff always drags me down  
No way out  
Never gonna get it
