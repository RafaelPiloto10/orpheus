Well it's a fragile tension,  
That's keeping us going.  
It may not last forever,  
But oh, when it's flowing.  
  
There's something magical in the air.  
Some things so tragic we have to care.  
  
It's a strange obsession,  
That's's drawing us nearer.  
We don't understand it,  
It never gets clearer.  
  
There's something mystical in our genes.  
So simplistic it kicks and screams.  
  
Oh when we're teetering  
On the edge of the collapse,  
Nothing can keep us down.  
  
It's a dizzying feeling  
That's keeping us flying.  
Some glittering galas,  
Without even trying.  
  
There's something radical in our hands.  
Nothing logical to our plans.
