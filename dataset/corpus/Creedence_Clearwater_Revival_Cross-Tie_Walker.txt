I went down to the station, just to take a ride.  
I went down to the station, just to take a ride.  
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind.  
  
Pullin' out from the platform, there was no brass band.  
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand.  
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train.  
Train, train, train, train.  
  
Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down.  
  
Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down.  
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run.  
Run, run, run, run.  
  
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.  
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.  
'Cause there's more miles between us than the Santa Fe line.  
Run, run, run, run.  
  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm....
