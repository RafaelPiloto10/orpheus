[Verse 1]  
Here comes the lyrical breakdown  
Move out the way punk, and take a seat clown  
It's the Ice Man slicin', Dicin'  
Hittin' like Tyson  
So listen to the rhythm I givin' 'em  
My lyrics got the impact of a Mac truck when I'm sendin' 'em  
Yo, My funky rhymes flow  
Kickin it like psycho  
And I'm exploding like nitro-glis  
Coming like a hurricane bliss  
Straight sacking the track like a quarterback  
My man Zero is back with a killer slice  
I'm blowin' up the mic  
Ya damn right, Vanilla Ice  
With twice the punch  
I put the crunch on Marky  
And take the funky out of his bunch  
I hit the home run  
You got to third base, son  
I'm in first place  
Take a seat clown for the beatdown  
[Verse 2]  
Uh, tonight's the night of the big fight  
With the mic in my hand I got the grip tights  
Ready to swing it like a Louisville slugger  
Right at the head of a sucka  
Crack home run  
How did it feel to have the mic hit ya dome, Son? Uh!  
I tried to make your head ring like a church bell  
I put it on ya hard  
I'll make ya hurt well  
'cause you fell into my booby traps  
No more good vibrations  
I'm tired of your boots raps  
So I eat ya like scooby snacks  
An maybe roll you like a zig zag  
Or smoke you like a hootie mac  
You did what I did  
So you're gonna lose kid  
Cause to me you're still a new kid on the block  
Get off my jock, Get off my diznok  
Before you get dropped for the beatdown  
[Verse 3]  
Yeah, this is the last verse  
Should I say the last round  
And its time I knock out another class clown  
Sit down and take notes  
As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics  
Oh what a pity, though  
Cause ya had to spend three million dollars on your video  
It was video and I can admit that  
All that money's wasted cause your song's wack  
I make stuff to make the people gather  
An' let 'em see us in a pit  
I want to slam dance with ya, Hammer  
Now can I kick it, of course I can  
yo, you will get burned out, then turned out  
I'm gonna keep comin strong, song after song  
Ya thought I'd fade, well ya did wrong  
I'm the imperial threat for this sound fools  
Ha Ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown
