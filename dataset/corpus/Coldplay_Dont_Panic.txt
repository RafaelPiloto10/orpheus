Bones sinking like stones  
All that we've fought for  
Homes, places we've grown  
All of us are done for  
  
We live in a beautiful world  
Yeah we do  
Yeah we do  
We live in a beautiful world  
  
Bones sinking like stones

Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world  
  
We live in a beautiful world  
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world  
  
Oh all that I know  
There's nothing here to run from  
Cause here  
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on
