Always just coming in here,  
Starts the game  
Why can't this puzzle be solved  
Each time it happens it's  
  
Always the same  
I look down and then start to bawl  
And all I see it burned my eyes  
Burning all inside  
  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
  
Always this teasing  
Sometimes I lose faith  
Where is my strength to hold on?  
Facing existence how can I relate?  
  
Do I stand clear or move on?  
And all I see it burned my eyes  
Burning all inside  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
One more time.  
  
Falling through this space in time  
Buried in this hurt of mine  
Falling slowly like a dream  
Falling through a world unseen  
  
Why can I not break this spell?  
I'm in darkness, is this hell?  
Falling towards this hole I see  
This is how it has to be.  
  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
  
One more time.  
One more time.  
One more time.
