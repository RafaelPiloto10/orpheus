My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars  
And you're the only one that could take me this far  
I'll be forever searching for your love  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of find the stars  
And you're the only one that could take me this far  
I'll be forever searching for your love  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?
