If I had only known, it was our last walk in the rain  
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm  
And I would hold your hand like a lifeline to my heart  
Underneath the thunder we'd be warm  
If I had only known it was our last walk in the rain  
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again  
I'd memorize each thing you ever said  
And on those lonely nights, I could think of them once more  
Keep your words alive inside my head  
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again  
Come back let me hold you one more time  
Let me say goodbye  
If I had only known, it was my last night in your arms  
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn  
And by the candle's glow, I would look into your eyes  
And make sure you know my love for you goes on and on  
If I had only known, oh, if I had only known  
The love I would've shown if I had only known
