Will you be there beside me  
If the world falls apart  
And will all of out moments  
Remain in your heart  
Will you be there to guide me  
All the way through, I wonder will you  
  
Walk by my side, and follow my dreams  
And bear with my pride, as strong as it seems  
Will you be there tomorrow  
  
Will you be there beside me  
As time goes on by  
And be there to hold me  
Whenever I cry  
Will you be there to guide me  
All the way through, I wonder will you  
  
Walk by my side, and follow my dreams...
