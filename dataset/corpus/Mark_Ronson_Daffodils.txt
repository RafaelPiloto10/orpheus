Run your fingers down the cool  
Underbelly of the blue evening  
Crank that vapor-wagon  
Start that kick dragon beating  
Step out on the patio  
Follow where your daddy-o's leading  
  
Wrestle with our shadow twins  
Hold'em till they're glowin' in warning  
Hit that bubble kit now  
Laughin' as you breathe out, easy  
Drop another daffodil  
We can push on through till morning  
  
Drop another daffodil sail off the map until morning  
  
Baby just say no to sleep  
Bodies got to keep exploring  
Sweet volcano violence  
Vast new continents spawning  
Drop another daffodil  
We can push on through till morning  
  
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning  
  
Put another record on  
Maybe Chaka Khan or Rocky  
Catch on fire above the  
Green empire of the kraken  
Flow with the isosceles  
To the beat of six knees knocking  
  
Drop another daffodil we can push on through till morning  
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning
