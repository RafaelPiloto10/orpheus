Baby Let's Rock!  
  
baby, i'm the greatest thing you've got  
in a good way i suppose  
exactly where you are is where i'm not  
so from a lead balloon inside your room  
i'll drop sparks  
you can kick, you can cry, you can fuss  
but let's rock  
  
baby, is there time for loves  
so go and grab your brand new shoes  
i've taken care of everything  
and when i can't can't you know i'm tying knots  
baby, let's rock  
  
baby, i'm the greatest thing you've got  
my rings are to set the stone  
but every single wish is still a lie  
so in my time machine  
i'll adjust the scenes  
turn back your clocks  
you can bitch, you can cry, you can moan  
but let's rock  
  
baby, there's no time for loves  
so go and grab your brand new shoes  
i've taken care of everything  
and when i can't you know i won't abuse  
baby, let's rock  
let's rock  
let's rock  
let's rock  
let's rock  
  
i dream about you every night  
and when i do you're holding me tight  
i'd love somebody like you in my life  
in my life  
  
baby, i'm the greatest thing you've got  
in a good way i should hope  
in a good way i suppose  
  
baby, i'm the greatest thing you've got  
baby, i'm the greatest thing you've got  
i've taken care of everything  
i've even gone and changed all the locks  
baby, let's rock  
let's rock
