Well, I'm sitting on the bus  
Rolling down through Georgia  
Don't know where I'm going  
And I don't care what's new  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
Well, I've had no sleep  
Going on three days  
Smoked my last cigarette  
Somewhere near Atlanta  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Well, we're coming up on Macon  
Gonna rest here a spell  
Making idle conversation  
With a stranger without you  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Ooh, nothing to lose  
Ooh, since I lost you  
  
You left me with no worry  
You left with no cares  
And you took my whole life with you  
And you left me standing there  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Yes, it's true  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
  
Nothing left to lose
