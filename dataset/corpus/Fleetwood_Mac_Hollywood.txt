The bright lights of the city  
Are starting to wear me down  
And when I need you  
You just can't be found  
  
Loud days, endless nights  
Are starting to make me crazy  
And now youre gone  
Theres nothing left for me  
  
(hollywood)  
I don't care for sunny weather  
(aint that good)  
I like the change of seasons better  
(knock on wood)  
I love the feel of rain upon my face  
(for hollywood)  
(hollywood)  
No and I don't care if the snow comes down  
(aint that good)  
Kick the falling leaves around  
(knock on wood)  
Got to move to some other kind of town  
(for hollywood)  
  
Wonderful to know you  
Great to know you cared  
As I look back  
At the crazy things weve shared  
  
I was dazzled by the moonlight  
Blinded by neon nights  
And as I look back  
It never could be right  
  
(hollywood)  
I don't care for sunny weather  
(aint that good)  
I like the change of seasons better  
(knock on wood)  
I love the feel of rain upon my face  
(for hollywood)  
(hollywood)  
No and I don't care if the snow comes down  
(aint that good)  
Kick the falling leaves around  
(knock on wood)  
Got to move to some other kind of town  
(for hollywood)  
  
Well I was dazzled by the moonlight  
Blinded by neon nights  
And now I see  
It never could be right  
  
(hollywood)  
I don't care for sunny weather  
(aint that good)  
I like the change of seasons better  
(knock on wood)  
I love the feel of rain upon my face  
(for hollywood)  
(hollywood)  
No and I don't care if the snow comes down  
(aint that good)  
Kick the falling leaves around  
(knock on wood)  
Got to move to some other kind of town  
(for hollywood)  
  
Some other kind of town...
