Hmm yea  
Hey yea  
  
Can you imagine what would happen  
If we could have any dream  
I wish this moment was ours to  
Own it and that it would never leave  
  
Then I would thank that star  
That made our wish come true  
Oh yea cause he  
Knows that where you are  
Is where I should be too  
  
Chorus:  
RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW  
I'm looking at you and my  
Heart loves the view cuz  
You mean everything  
(Everything)  
RIGHT HERE  
I'll promise you somehow  
That tomorrow can wait  
For some other day to be  
(To be) but right now  
There's you and me  
  
If this was forever what  
Could be better we already  
Proved it was but in 2123  
Hours abandon the universe  
Gonna make you everything  
In our whole world change  
(It's our change, yea)  
  
And you know that where we  
Are will never be th same  
Oh no oh no  
  
Chorus:  
RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW  
I'm looking at you and my  
Heart loves the view cuz  
You mean everything  
  
RIGHT HERE  
I'll promise you somehow  
That tomorrow can wait  
For some other day to be  
(To be) but right now  
There's you and me  
  
Oh we know it's coming  
And it's coming fast  
(As long as there's you  
And me oh yea) so lets  
Make this second last  
Make it last  
  
Chorus:  
Right Here ohh right now  
Yea I'm looking at you  
And my heart loves the view  
Cuz you mean everything  
  
RIGHT HERE  
I'll promise you somehow  
That tomorrow can wait  
For some other day to be  
(To be) but right now  
There's you and me  
  
RIGHT HERE  
I promise you somehow  
Tomorrow can wait for  
Some other day to be  
(To be) but right now  
There's you and me  
(You and me) ohh  
You and me but right  
Now there's you and  
Meee
