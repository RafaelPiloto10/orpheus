Every day it seems we hear the same old story.  
Every day there's lovers giving up on love.  
People say it's just a fact of modern living.  
All around us, people fall in love and marry.  
Then we hear they're breaking up, and wonder why?  
Did they mean it when they said it was forever?  
All I know is what I feel.  
[Chorus:]  
Forever  
Is a long, long time.  
Longer than we ever realize.  
Forever  
Is a long, long time.  
I'm gonna love you the rest of my life.  
Forever.  
Every day I spend with you, I call it lucky,  
Every night we touch and speak the words of love.  
Did I mean it when I said it was forever?  
All I know is what I feel.  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna love you the rest of my life  
Forever
