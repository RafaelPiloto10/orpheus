There's a time for love and a time for healing  
Can't go back and undo what's been done  
The word of mouth, time is revealing  
Just how far we've left this kingdom come  
Hand in hand we're finding our way  
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Kiss of life and the hand of fate  
Boy grows up into his father's son  
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate  
To carry on the way it had been done  
All our lives, it's debts to repay  
Maybe someday we can put the past away  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Put your fear away, find a better way  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Underneath a broken sky  
Love can heal the pain inside  
In a moment things can change  
One look behind and it's never the same
