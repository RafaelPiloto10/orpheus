I've really made a fool of myself  
I hit the wall but it never bothered you at all  
Oohhh  
My pony bolted out too soon  
Left me howling at the moon  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
  
I didn't know what I was s'posed to be  
I tried to bluff, but I never offered you enough,  
Oohh  
Now I'm feeling the remorse  
I want you back because of course  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
  
Do you remember when, you gave your heart to me  
I want it back again, I want it back again  
Oh baby, Sweet baby  
  
Won't you reconsider me?  
Coz as anyone can see..  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace  
  
You are my saving grace  
You put me in my place  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace
