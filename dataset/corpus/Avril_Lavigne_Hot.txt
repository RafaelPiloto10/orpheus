You're so good to me, baby, baby  
  
I wanna lock you up in my closet  
When no one's around  
I wanna put your hand in my pocket  
Because you're allowed  
I wanna drive you into the corner  
And kiss you without a sound  
I wanna stay this way forever  
I'll say it loud  
  
Now you're in, and you can't get out  
  
[Chorus]  
You make me so hot  
Make me wanna drop  
It's so ridiculous  
I can barely stop  
I can hardly breathe  
You make me wanna scream  
You're so fabulous  
You're so good to me, baby, baby  
You're so good to me, baby, baby  
  
I can make you feel all better  
Just take it in  
And I can show you all the places  
You've never been  
And I can make you say everything  
That you've never said  
And I will let you do anything  
Again and again  
  
Now you're in, and you can't get out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kiss me gently  
Always I know  
Hold me, love me  
Don't ever go, oh, oh  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
You're so good
