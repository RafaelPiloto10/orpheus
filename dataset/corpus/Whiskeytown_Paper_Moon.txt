I go walkin' under a paper moon  
All the birds are singing  
Singing you a pretty tune  
All the constellations and all the stars above  
They all start to whistling  
They start singing along  
  
The world is not a monster  
And I'm not scared at all  
Floatin' through your heavens  
The world is in my arms  
  
Oh rainy day  
Don't follow me  
Cause I'm her baby doll  
She's my cup of tea  
  
I go walkin' under a paper moon  
And my eyes are made of crystals  
Plastic flowers bloom  
All the leaves are changing  
And the skies are blue  
All these seasons of distraction  
Can't take the smile God's given you  
  
The world is but a monster  
And I'm not scared at all  
I'm floatin' through the heavens  
The world is in my arms  
  
Oh rainy day  
Don't follow me  
Cause I'm her baby doll  
She's my cup of tea  
  
Love takes care of love  
Hate just burns you out
