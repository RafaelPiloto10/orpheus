Hey, comin' out around the world, be ready for a brand new beat  
Oh, summer's here and the time is right, oh, for dancing in the street  
Dancing in Chicago (Dancing in the street)  
Down in New Orleans (Dancing in the street)  
In New York City (Dancing in the street)  
  
All we need is music, sweet music (Sweet, sweet music)  
There'll be music everywhere (Everywhere)  
There'll be laughing, singing, music swinging and dancing in the street  
  
It doesn't matter what you wear, just as long as you are there  
They're dancing (Dancing in the street) oh, oh  
  
This is an invitation across the nation the chance for folks to meet  
There'll be swinging, swaying, music playing and dancing in the street

Baltimore and D.C. (Dancing in the street)  
Can't forget them other cities (Dancing in the street)
