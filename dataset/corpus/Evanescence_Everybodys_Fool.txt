Perfect by nature  
Icons of self indulgence  
Just what we all need  
More lies about a world that  
  
Never was and never will be  
Have you no shame don't you see me  
You know you've got everybody fooled  
  
Look here she comes now  
Bow down and stare in wonder  
Oh how we love you  
No flaws when you're pretending  
But now I know she  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you've got everybody fooled  
  
Without the mask where will you hide  
Can't find yourself lost in your lie  
  
I know the truth now  
I know who you are  
And I don't love you anymore  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you have everybody fooled  
  
It never was and never will be  
You're not real and you can't save me  
Somehow now you're everybody's fool
