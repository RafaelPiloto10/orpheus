I bear lots of animosity to bellhops, they never bring my luggage up on time.  
And taxi drivers really tax my patience,  
If they vanished, would it really be a crime?  
I don't like meter maids or underwater welders,  
Health fanatic cooks or camera crews.  
Not fond of monks or yoga teachers, or sports fans in the bleachers.  
And I'm not sure how I'm feeling about you!  
There are lots of horrid people on this planet,  
That I would love to give a lashing to!  
But my goody-two-shoes brother, the favorite of my mother,  
He's the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo!  
Yes, my goody-two-shoes brother, the favorite of my mother,  
He's the one I want to smother -- Thank you, Sir! I'll have another!  
He's the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo!
