I don't know much about love  
How it cures and frees the soul  
Makes you whole and all that other stuff  
But I was kissed by lady luck  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you  
  
Sometimes it gets so very hard  
It's like we're trying to tear each other apart  
With every scar a deeper love revealed  
Now there's nothing left to conceal  
No there's nothing left to conceal  
  
With every turn it's like we hit a wall  
Do you see it the same way  
And I don't want to complicate it  
But I hate this place  
And there's only so much that I can take  
Before this glass heart breaks  
  
And I know I've got to let you go  
You were gone so long  
And I didn't even know  
It's just that I love you so  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you
