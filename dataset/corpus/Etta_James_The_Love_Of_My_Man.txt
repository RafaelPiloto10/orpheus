The love of my man  
Keeps me safe and warm  
The love of my man  
Protects me from all harm  
'Cause I know he loves me  
And I love him so, yes I do  
  
And oh, the love of my man  
It makes my whole life worth living  
The love of my man  
Makes me feel just like giving  
Giving, yeah  
And when his lips touch mine  
It gives me a feeling so divine  
Yes it does  
  
When he goes away  
I'm never, never lonely  
'Cause I know he thinks of me  
He thinks of me only, yes he does  
But I'll go on loving him  
I'll go on loving him anyway  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh the love-the love-the love of my man  
Early in the morning  
I like to talk about the love of my man  
Late in the evening  
In the wee hours of the morning  
I like to talk about the love of my man  
It's good...
