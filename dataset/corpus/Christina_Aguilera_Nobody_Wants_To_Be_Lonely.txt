Why, why, why  
Oh ooh ohh  
  
There you are, in a darkened room  
And you're all alone, looking out the window  
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love  
Like a broken arrow  
Here I stand in the shadows  
In the shadows  
Come to come, come to me  
Can't you see that  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why (why), why don't you let me love you  
  
Why (ooh ohh yeah), why (oh why), why  
  
Ooh ooh, yeah  
Can you hear my voice, do you hear my song  
It's a seranade, so your heart can find me, ohh  
And suddenly you're flying down the stairs  
Into my arms, baby, ohh  
  
Before I start going crazy  
Going crazy, ohh  
Run to me  
Run to me  
Cause I'm dying...  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry (I don't wanna cry)  
My body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why  
  
Why, why don't you let me love you  
I wanna feel you need me  
Feel you need me  
Just like the air you're breathing  
Breathing, I need you here in my life  
  
Don't walk away, don't walk away  
Don't walk alway, don't walk away  
No, no, no, no...  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry... Yeah yeah  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely (yeah ohh ooh)  
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry)  
My body's longing to hold you (is longing to hold you)  
So bad it hurts inside (hurts inside)  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why (why), why don't you let me love you  
Let me love you...  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry...)  
My body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)  
So bad it hurts inside (so hurt inside)  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why (why), why don't you let me love you  
  
Why (why), let me love you  
Why don't you let me love you  
Why, love you, let me love you  
  
Why (why)
