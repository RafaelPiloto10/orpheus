I'm not a thug  
No, no, no, no  
I'm not a gangsta  
But I won't hesitate  
To cock back, bust and point blank ya  
Lord thank ya  
I'm like that coke and weed  
When it burn slow  
Motherfucker I'll stank ya  
That's what I been  
Taught on these streets  
Ain't a god damn thing  
That can't be bought on these streets  
You want a life gone  
That could be done  
I'm like a nigga that did ten years  
I'm eager to come  
In the game  
And do more than entertain  
I'm loco in the brain  
I'm that man with the methods  
And I always bring the pain  
They know me out here  
All these bitches cocaine  
Cause they blow me out here  
I'm always out here  
Y'all keep it real  
But I keep it realer  
I'm a make my first mil off the deal  
But I'm still gon be labeled  
A cuban dope dealer  
I'm just statin the facts  
Motherfucker  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
I hang with Puerto Ricans and  
Haitian killers and  
Cuban dope dealers  
And these here my niggaz  
I ride for 'em  
And god dammit I'd die for 'em  
  
I got that really foul  
Kung flo flow  
I'm tryna get that really foul  
Kung do doe  
But you don't know me homie  
So don't judge me  
I rep the real Miami  
That's why the city loves me  
The feds want to bug me  
Haters want to slug me  
I thank God  
Cause he's the only thing that's above me  
Y'all goin feel me till it hurts  
Like, losin your family over someone elses work  
Or,losin your case cause your co-defendent chirped  
Or, losin your brain cause them thangs done burped  
It gets worse  
This is for those  
That'll never see the sun again  
That'll pick through shit  
For a balloon just to get it in  
This is what was fed to him  
This is why the game let him in here  
Being me (me)  
Being Pit (Pit)  
Being It  
Pitbull and Trick (Trick)  
Both from the down south  
Bitch we from the bottom, shit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Trick Daddy]  
Lord your son got problems  
And I know that you know  
Cause you made this all possible  
I live a dangerous ass life you know  
So I thank you for your doctors and your hospitals  
Thank God for the thugs too  
He understand what these drugs do  
He want to see us all pull through  
But only if niggaz in the hood knew  
Hell, prayin ain't wrong  
But the sqeezin trigger  
Could you go kill a innocent man  
While these weak niggaz grillin his end  
They tellin ya dawg  
Reducin they business  
If I wasn't doin this  
Then I'd go do him in  
Cause if he was dead  
He couldn't say he knew me then  
For them niggaz who lie  
When they pull me in  
Its in the same older cell that they threw me in  
And I just pray for 'em  
  
[Chorus]
