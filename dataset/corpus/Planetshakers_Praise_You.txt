I will praise You  
Name above every name  
'Cause I'm trusting  
In Your Word every day  
  
It don't matter  
Even what people say  
'Cause I'm walking  
In my promise today  
  
Even when I'm scared  
When I'm in the lowest valley  
I know that You are always there  
And I will praise You  
  
I will sing Your praise forever  
I will sing, I will praise You  
I will shout Your Name forever  
I will sing, I will praise You  
  
O Praise Him  
Jesus, Jesus  
  
Praise Him  
All the earth  
Praise Him
