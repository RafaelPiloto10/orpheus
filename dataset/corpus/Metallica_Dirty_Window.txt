I see my reflection in the window  
It looks different, so different than what you see  
Projecting judgment on the world  
This house is clean baby  
This house is clean  
  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong  
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down  
  
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

I see my reflection in the window  
This window clean inside, dirty on the out  
I'm looking different than me  
This house is clean baby  
This house is clean  
  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
I look my window and see it's gone wrong  
My court is in session and now I slam my gavel down

I drink from the cup of denial  
I'm judging the world from my throne

I'm judging the world from my throne
