Here comes that man again  
It's always round midnight  
That Amsterdam creeps into my PC  
After a long hard day selling pornography  
  
He likes to come home and talk to me  
He's got his mind on the job but  
His technological props  
Oops, another file on the email  
  
And though I'm scared to click open  
I just can't help having a look  
Oh, here comes that man again  
A car crash in my psyche  
  
My curiosity's driving me  
Yes here he comes again  
Who'd have thought I'd have as much fun  
With an anonymous Dutchman?  
  
I never knew I had it in me  
He says the camera is on and  
Can I see him yet?  
I say "Babe you look like a ghost  
  
And sound like a Dalek to me"  
So let's go back to the written word  
Even though we both know it's absurd  
Here comes that man again  
  
Here comes that man again  
Here comes that man again  
Here comes that man again  
He knows that I'm online  
  
"Knock knock, who's there?"  
It's just a matter of time  
Here comes millennium man  
Rum and coke in one hand  
  
And in the other...  
Is that a mouse a see?  
Although when I tell him he's corny  
It seems to make him quite horny  
  
And through the cyberspace  
I watch the rapture on his face  
Yes while his girlfriend is sleeping  
His sexuality's peeking  
  
Here comes that man again  
After a long hard day  
He likes to come home and talk to me  
He says it's something he needs  
  
He can't stop spilling the seeds  
God bless European unity  
And all those who never sleep  
  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off  
  
Another stain on another blue dress  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off  
Yes, yes
