I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain and deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
Well, I guess when you met me  
That it was just one of those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
Oh, you're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
Won't that be fine  
  
Day may be cloudy or sunny  
We're either in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine  
  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
Won't that be fine  
  
Day may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine  
  
Rain or shine  
I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or whine
