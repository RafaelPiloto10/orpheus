Cheater, I know where you've been  
Cheater, your lies can't hide your sin  
Cheater, don't ask me how I've know  
Cheater, I guess it's time for you to go  
  
I'm tired of chasing shadows  
So illusive in the night  
And your empty words  
That leave me high and dry  
Now the curtain's finally fallen  
On this fantasy affair  
You've had me for the last time  
With your lies  
  
Cheater, you're a cheater  
I know where you've been  
Cheater, your lies can't hide your sin  
Cheater, don't ask me how I've know  
Cheater, I guess it's time for you to go  
  
The voices in the wind I heard  
Kept telling me to run  
Whispering a warning to my heart  
And the voices deep as thunder  
Tried to speak of things to come  
I was blinded then  
But now I see the light  
  
Cheater, you're a cheater  
And I know where you've been  
Cheater, mean mistreater  
Your lies can't hide your sin  
Cheater, don't ask me how I've know  
Cheater, I guess it's time for you to go  
  
Cheater, I know where you've been  
Cheater, you're a cheater  
Cheater, you're a cheater  
Cheater, I know where you've been  
Your lies can't hide your sins  
Cheater
