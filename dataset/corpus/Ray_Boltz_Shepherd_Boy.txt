Shepherd Boy  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
One by one Jesse's sons  
Stood before the prophet  
Their father knew a king  
Would soon be found  
And each one passed  
Except the last  
No one thought to call him  
Surely he would never  
Wear a crown  
Chorus:  
But when others see a shepherd boy  
God may see a king  
Even though your life seems filled  
With ordinary things  
In just a moment He can touch you  
And everything will change  
When others see a shepherd boy  
God may see a king  
One by one problems come  
And dreams get shattered  
And sometimes it's hard  
To understand  
But things like chance  
And circumstance  
They don't really matter  
Our Father holds tomorrow  
In His hands  
Chorus  
Well it wasn't the oldest  
It wasn't the strongest  
Chosen on that day  
And yet the giants fell  
And nations trembled  
When they stood in his way  
Chorus
