Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me  
I keep telling my self that it's true  
I can get over anything you want my love  
But I can't get myself over you  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
Though I try to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole  
Let me try to go on living right now  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love
