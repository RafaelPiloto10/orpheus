I'd rather leave while I'm in love  
While I still believe the meaning of the word  
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend  
That you and I were never meant to end  
  
Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebody's heart gets broken  
And usually it's mine  
I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and I can't say goodbye  
  
So, if you wake and find me gone  
Oh, babe, just carry on  
You see, I need my fantasy  
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love, ooh  
  
Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebody's heart gets broken, yeah  
And usually it's mine  
I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and I, we can't say goodbye  
  
So, if you wake and find me gone  
Hey, babe, just carry on  
You see, I need my fantasy  
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love, oh, oh  
I'd rather leave while I'm in love
