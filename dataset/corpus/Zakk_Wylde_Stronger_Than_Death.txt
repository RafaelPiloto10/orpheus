Hunt me down, seek me out, bring your best  
That's how I want it to be  
Full of doubt, full of fear, all's unclear  
It's over 'cause now I can see  
Like a tank, seething strength, crushing all  
Pulling you under my treads  
Lost some years, lost some days, that's okay  
I piss on what's in my way  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Looked inside, found myself, it was me  
Waitin' there at the well  
If you're green, you ain't seen, life's a game  
Sometimes it's just hard to tell  
Gouging eyes, breakin' bones, eatin' flesh  
Puts a smile on my face  
Crawlin' through glass, eatin' nails, losin' blood  
It's all part of findin' your place  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution

Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest
