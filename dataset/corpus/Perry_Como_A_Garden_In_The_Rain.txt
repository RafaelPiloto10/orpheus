'Twas just a garden in the rain,  
Close to a little leafy lane  
A touch of colour 'neath skies of gray!  
The raindrops kissed the flower beds  
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads  
A perfumed thank you they seem to say!  
Surely here was charm beyond compare to view  
Maybe it was just that I was there  
With you!  
'Twas just a garden in the rain,  
But then the sun came out again  
And sent us happily on our way!  
Surely here was charm beyond compare to view  
But, maybe it was just that you were there dear,  
You were so lovely!  
'Twas just a garden in the rain,  
But then the sun came out again  
And sent us happily on our way!  
Just a garden in the rain!
