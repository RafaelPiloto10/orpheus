I smoked my last cigarette  
Threw that nasty habit away  
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet  
Didn't ever win anyway  
  
Gave up the wine and whiskey  
'Cause everybody said I should  
But I'm givin' up on quittin' you, baby  
'Cause it feels so damn good  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
And I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
You been runnin' around for a long time now  
I know all the games you play  
Sooner or later you will put me down  
Gonna have to face it someday  
  
But baby, every time you hold me  
And I get another taste of your kiss  
I feel a power comin' over me  
That my body just can't miss  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
I try, try, try,  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
Why can't you just say no?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I let you go?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
Why, why do I keep, keep breakin' down?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I turn around?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
You know I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
I give in to you, baby  
You are my strongest weakness  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
(Deepest secret)  
Deepest secret  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Strongest weakness  
(Deepest secret)  
You are, you are  
(Strongest weakness)
